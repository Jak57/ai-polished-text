We might get the keys at closing—I’m getting really excited. If everything goes smoothly this week, we should be set to close a week from Wednesday. Last night, Bethany and I stayed up past 3:00 AM watching movies. There’s been a lot of movie-watching happening lately. Here’s the rundown: last night, we watched *Thirteen*—a film every mother of a teenager should see. It was better than I expected. After that, we watched *Gigli*—and yes, it was just as bad as the reviews claimed, but we had to see for ourselves."
2,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,blog,"Summer TV used to be a dead zone filled with reruns, but now there are two fantastic new shows I’ve been watching religiously for the past week. *Blow Out* has the gayest concept ever, yet somehow features zero gay people in sight. The show follows hairstylist Jonathan Antin as he attempts to open a second location of his wildly popular West Hollywood salon—this time in Beverly Hills. Normally, no one would care (least of all me), but while flipping through channels, I caught a glimpse of Jonathan—equally narcissistic and dull—standing in an empty space on Rodeo Drive, declaring (in his most theatrical voice), *""I am going to build the greatest salon in the history of the world—ever!""* And just like that, I was hooked. Not since *Rocco* have I found such a mesmerizingly clueless character so compelling to watch."

Whenever I move my arm too much—especially while using a computer mouse—the pain is unbearable. I’ve overdone it lately, updating my website and working on other online tasks, so now I can barely move it. Finding the energy to draw anything feels impossible, and the lack of sleep only makes the pain worse. I’m not in the best spirits right now, but I’ll recover.  

On a brighter note, my mom’s surgery went well. Her eyesight has improved slightly—she can now see blurry shapes and distinguish colors. Still, her vision remains severely impaired. Here’s hoping she regains it fully soon."

Today, I attempted to do laundry with the kids in tow and realized how quickly even the simplest tasks can turn into an absolute ordeal. I also discovered just how unexpectedly sweet complete strangers can be—for no reason other than their own goodwill. Trust me, it wasn’t as if they had ulterior motives. I was covered in kid drool and sporting my ""laundry day"" attire... Besides, I’m not entirely sure I’ll ever bathe again, so there wasn’t even an olfactory incentive!

I'm happy to show care and support in this way, but where do you draw the line between helping and being taken advantage of?  

The past few weeks, I've been staying up late reading and such, so I was looking forward to turning in early—until I realized it made more sense to finish this repair and return the computer to its owner. *Laughs* No rest for the weary, right?

After that awkward lunch, my confidence was shaken, and I realized I left out a key detail. Before Pat arrived, Dustin started talking about what a great guy Pat is and how he’s trying to find him a girlfriend. I listened and nodded, slowly realizing the conversation was more about matchmaking for Dustin’s best friend than whatever small talk you’d normally have with a stranger over pink lemonade. I excused myself to the bathroom, stared into the mirror, and silently wondered: Am I being passed off to the other guy? Is this really happening?"

Now, I’m not claiming to be the sharpest tool in the shed—but I’m not talking about complex intellectual feats here, so I believe it’s fair to call out sheer stupidity.

1. While Bush is indeed stimulating the economy, his approach is misguided. As Robert Rubin noted on NPR's *Marketplace* today, the same economic stimulus could have been achieved without incurring long-term debt by implementing temporary tax cuts targeted at low- and middle-income earners. Ah, Robert Rubin—his very name carries a reassuring weight. Try naming a single domestic cabinet official in the Bush administration with Rubin's stature. Struggling? It might take a moment...  

2. Granting Republicans exclusive control during wartime is untenable, given their creation of an endless, global ""War on Terror."" Their strategy ensures perpetual conflict, making this concession unwise."

Like when you're sitting in math class, utterly bored, and you begin to wonder what exactly happens in your brain that allows you to comprehend math? Then it dawns on you—you exist, you're in math class, and you question why. Suddenly, you're struck by how incredible existence is. And just as quickly, it hits you—the fact that you're spiraling into this random train of thought is downright pitiful. Ever experienced that? I despise it.  

You know what else I hate? Block schedules. Who in their right mind thought that was a good idea? It’s obvious that enduring a two-and-a-half-hour class in any subject is nothing short of cruel and unusual punishment."

First, I have to say that camp was incredible—even better than I imagined. God has been working in my life so much lately, and it’s truly amazing. I feel like I’ve turned over a new leaf, but anyway, back to the start. We arrived at the Twiggs’ house on Friday evening and stayed until we left for camp on Monday.

T.V. Rajeswar, the former head of the Intelligence Bureau and the incumbent Governor of Uttar Pradesh, had foreseen this grave danger in a series of articles published in *The Hindustan Times* back in 1996. Shourie raises a pertinent question: Does the revelation that Rajeswar—and not he or Mr. Advani—authored those warnings lend them greater credibility? Or does one dismiss the concerns, labeling Rajeswar a closet communalist for his repeated assertions, and argue that he should no longer serve as Governor of Uttar Pradesh?"

Yesterday was Shakespeare on the Green—a lovely play, though I had to leave before the final curtain, which was disappointing. Hopefully, someday I’ll see a full Shakespeare performance. But I digress. Akcron is right about the shower issues—it’s terrible.

Yesterday evening, I went home and simply collapsed into sleep, only waking when my mother called me around eight-thirty. When I opened my eyes, the room was pitch black—I hadn’t turned on the lights—and for a few disoriented moments, I couldn’t tell the time or even the date. There was just my mother’s voice in the darkness and me struggling to grasp reality. I wonder why I’ve been feeling so drained…

17,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,blog,"Last night was truly dreadful. I ended up discarding the sweater I’d been knitting, even though I’d already completed about 14 inches. It was a waste of roughly $10 worth of yarn (at $8 per skein), but by the time I reached the armholes, the stitch count was off, and the mohair kept tangling as I worked. Frogging—undoing rows—was nearly impossible because the yarn kept snapping. Oddly enough, I didn’t even curse, which is rare for me. Instead, I just gloomily unraveled it while binge-watching season two of *Sex and the City* (thanks, library!). Eventually, frustration won out, and I tossed it. I guess you could say I learned a lot from this sweater attempt."

In the opening chapter, Casey argues that contemporary culture prioritizes time as the central organizing force—evident in phrases like ""running out of time,"" ""saving time,"" or ""just in time."" He proposes, instead, that centering culture around place fosters a more grounded and connected community.

This entire spectacle was orchestrated by Republicans who, frustrated that Democrats refused to rubber-stamp four of Bush’s controversial judicial picks, staged a days-long political tantrum to score points. Never mind that Democrats have already confirmed 168 of Bush’s nominees—apparently, that’s not enough for power-hungry Republicans who somehow believe they have a sweeping mandate for such theatrics."

I also read extensively, finishing three books over the weekend: Bruce Sterling’s *Heavy Weather*, Larry Niven’s *World of Ptavvs*, and Octavia Butler’s *Parable of the Sower*.  

*Heavy Weather* was an engaging cyberpunk adventure set in a near-future USA ravaged by global warming and societal collapse. While it was clever, well-paced, and thoroughly convincing, I have to admit that neither the story nor the characters left me with any profound impressions. That’s not to say they weren’t well-crafted or vividly portrayed—it’s a solid book, just not an exceptional one, in my opinion."

As I struggled to make sense of algebra, the doorbell rang. I set my book aside and went to answer it. No one was there. Perfect.  

I returned to my studies and, just as a faint glimmer of understanding began to surface in my subconscious, the doorbell rang again. *Bam*—just like that, my breakthrough vanished.

We didn’t stay long, though, as we moved on to explore another nearby waterfall after less than an hour. Another half-hour trek awaited us, but the effort was worth it—the falls were serene, and the view was truly breathtaking.

Naturalization ceremonies in Jacksonville are set to be relocated following complaints that GOP activists improperly registered new citizens as Republicans.

The citizenship ceremony in Jacksonville appeared to proceed as usual, with nearly 200 individuals departing as newly minted Americans. However, just before the event concluded on June 29, an immigration official overseeing the swearing-in encouraged attendees to visit a voter registration table—a common practice at such ceremonies.  

This table, however, stood out: the volunteers distributing forms were Republican activists, and the party affiliation box had been pre-checked, automatically enrolling new voters as GOP members.

Following our discussion yesterday afternoon, Reyna and I reviewed the NSP PowerPac agreement. We specifically examined the language to determine whether it requires us to reconcile adjustments for the customer, irrespective of storage allocation on a given gas day.  

While we couldn’t identify any explicit provision in the current agreement (dated April 1, 2001) mandating such reconciliation, it’s possible we may have overlooked or misinterpreted certain clauses.

**To:** All PX Market Participants  
**From:** John Yurkanin, Chief Operating Officer  
**Re:** Loss of Continuity in PX Day-Ahead Auction Due to ISO Rule Changes  

The emergency tariff filing by the California ISO last Friday has adversely impacted the PX day-ahead auction market. The combination of soft and hard caps creates a complete disconnect, introducing unacceptable risk for all participants. Furthermore, it is unlikely to achieve the ISO’s intended reduction in real-time energy sales and procurement.  

The broader consequence will be that supply will continue to favor the higher realized price opportunities offered by the ISO. In response, the PX is petitioning Terry Winter of the ISO to promptly permit adjustment bids on any submitted schedule at any relevant price."

You might also be interested to know that I spoke at length today with Lad Lorenz, and like most parties involved in this proceeding, SoCal Gas is thoroughly exhausted by this dispute.

Of course, SoCal will ultimately take the lead in drafting the tariff sheets to implement the settlement’s terms. I informed him that, in all likelihood, TW will oversee the implementation phase but is unlikely to mount any serious opposition to the CPUC’s ruling.

-Bill  

Effective immediately, Enron has secured control area reserves service from BPA. This arrangement enables services to sell unit-contingent energy as hourly firm, given that BPA is providing reserves for up to 60 minutes.  

If Grays Harbor Paper notifies RT of a unit derate or outage, RT must promptly inform BPA Dispatch and adjust the schedule during the next ramp. For instance, if Grays Harbor’s unit trips at 13:33, RT should notify BPA and the sink that, by the top of the hour (14:00), the schedule will be reduced to zero for the 14:00 interval.  

The key takeaway is that BPA will maintain the schedule for a maximum of 60 minutes."

I’d be happy to draft the transaction agreement, but I have a few questions for clarification:  

1. **Delivery Point and Interruptible Transport**: What is the relationship between the delivery point and the use of interruptible transport on the Northwest Pipeline? Is the transport upstream or downstream of the delivery point? If downstream, why isn’t EWEB contracting for it?  

2. **Daily Volume and DCQ**: You mentioned a daily contract quantity (DCQ) along with a 20% tolerance above or below the estimated quantity. Typically, a DCQ transaction wouldn’t include such a tolerance—could you clarify this?  

3. **Requirements Transaction**: Is this intended to be a requirements transaction? Also, will the price remain the same for volumes exceeding the estimated quantity, up to an additional 20%?

87,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,email_content,"The spreadsheet ""Jdasovic.nsf"" below outlines the implicit commodity rates based on the effective dates of four different rate schedules (Schedule DR). The rate schedule effective from August 2000 through September 2000 results in a significantly higher commodity charge because SDG&E customers will receive a lump sum reimbursement from SDG&E during those two months. Consequently, SDG&E customers can anticipate lower electric bills.  

Assuming the lump sum reimbursement is excluded from the implicit energy component, the average rate from June 2000 through January 2001 is 6.2 cents, while the implicit commodity average from February 2001 through December 2001 is 7.3 cents. The overall average implicit commodity rate from June 2000 through December 2001 is 6.9 cents. For deliveries starting September 1, 2000, the average remains unchanged at 6.9 cents."

With this, we now have access to $4 billion in total credit lines, which we will use to repay short-term commercial debt and ensure liquidity.

However, this is not the final resolution—the order only addresses January 2001, with further rulings expected for December 2000 and benchmark prices through April 2001.  

The refund calculations were based on relatively high prices ($273/MWh, factoring in gas prices, emissions costs, and an assumed heat rate exceeding 16,000). Regarding California sales, we have finalized at least one short-term agreement and have discussed longer-term deals with the California Department of Water Resources.

Unfortunately, Wizards of the Coast appears to have lost sight of this. If you opt to play with friends, you miss out on earning gold, which is crucial in-game. Gold is so vital that they’ve even imposed a daily cap—understandable, since it unlocks nearly everything.

98,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"As the third installment in the trilogy, I’ll address the drawbacks first. I’ve never been fond of prequels, as they inherently move a story backward rather than forward—a common issue with the genre. That said, it does expand the narrative in meaningful ways. The combat lacks precision and feels less refined compared to the tight mechanics of *Arkham City*. At the time of writing this review (26/10/2013), there’s a game-breaking bug that prevents a side mission from being completed (though the main story remains unaffected). Some gadgets are assigned to awkward hotkeys, forcing your hand to stretch across the entire keyboard—a minor annoyance in theory, but one that can disrupt your combat flow and break combos."
99,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"They’ve effectively improved *Shadow Warrior (2013)*—the boss fights are fantastic, the weapons feel great (maybe not quite as refined as *DOOM 2016*'s, but still solid), and enemies aren’t overly tanky (unless you mishandle elemental and upgrade mechanics). The upgrade system is well-balanced and becomes intuitive without feeling tedious. The elemental mechanics and limited ammo gently encourage experimenting with different weapons. There’s also a variety of genuinely unique weapons (a key distinction from *Borderlands*’ reliance on RNG-based loot) that remain useful throughout most of the game. The soundtrack is excellent, particularly the main theme and, of course, Stan Bush’s contributions."
100,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"So many things were done wrong. I don’t even know where to begin with this review. This all relates to my career mode. My player is an outside scorer, a point guard, standing at 1.71m, with maxed stats and all the necessary perks. Now, explain to me why shooting skill depends on a player’s height? Why can’t someone who is 1.74m be as good at shooting as someone who is 1.71m? In real life, I’m 1.87m tall, so I initially created my player at this height—only to later discover I couldn’t exceed an 89 skill rating. Why? That’s pure discrimination! And why doesn’t the game warn me about this before I create my character, or even when I hit the skill cap after weeks of playing?!"
101,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"I believe this Assassin's Creed installment perfected the mechanics across all aspects—ship battles, sailing, fishing, parkour, and more. I also felt a deeper connection to the protagonist. While the story begins somewhat uneven, it improves significantly as you progress (a trend I’ve noticed in most AC games). Edward was a compelling character, as were the supporting cast. The collectibles in this game felt more meaningful than in previous entries, perhaps because they served a greater purpose within the world. They weren’t mandatory, but they were enjoyable to pursue, offering well-balanced rewards."
102,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"While I personally can't recommend this game, it wasn't completely awful. The gunplay is decent, provided you have the funds to buy gun parts—which brings me to my primary criticism: it's pay-to-win. If I could overlook that aspect, the game would actually be enjoyable, as the hardsuit is a blast to use and HRV is a brilliant concept. I'd choose this over any Call of Duty title without hesitation, but its pay-to-win microtransaction system is a dealbreaker for me. If you're fine with this model, then by all means, enjoy it. But if you share my distaste for pay-to-win mechanics, it's best to pass—this one just isn't for us."
103,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"While not flawless, this game has been incredibly enjoyable. The save system and risk of sudden death can lead to occasional frustration—during my first playthrough, I lost my main character around the 10-hour mark of a roughly 20-hour campaign, and I really wished for a reloadable save at that point. Since then, I’ve started using a third-party mod/save tool to prevent catastrophic failures. Additionally, the aiming reticle is a bit small, and the zoom feels underpowered.  

That said, it’s been an absolute blast. I’m not usually a fan of zombie games, but the mix of strategy, missions, and first-person shooter/brawler mechanics is fantastic. I’ve been playing whenever I can—always telling myself, ""Just one more mission,"" or ""One more supply run,"" or fleeing to safety before quitting. It’s hard to put down."

Even the in-game chat box on the main menu is surprisingly entertaining—no joke. That said, if you think this game is 'easy' or you're new to the strategy genre, be prepared for a steep learning curve. Don’t get discouraged; you’ll lose plenty of units along the way. Just remember to plan ahead, always keep anti-air and anti-tank units ready, and you’ll get the hang of it."

The humor and voice acting in this game are phenomenal—just amazing. It’s not cheesy (well, maybe a little at times). Each story character has their own distinct sense of humor, and they truly feel like unique personalities. And the level design? Absolutely brilliant. By the way, I never played the first *Portal* game, but I plan to someday if I find the time. Honestly, I wouldn’t have touched this sequel if I hadn’t played it first."

Yes, this is a nostalgia trip for thirty-somethings who remember—at least in the UK—enduring the ever-irritating Timmy Mallet just to catch the five-minute *Transformers* cartoon. The original voice actors for Optimus, Megatron, Bumblebee, and many others return, instantly recognizable. The iconic cartoon transformation sound is faithfully recreated. Graphically, the cel-shaded art style is flawless, capturing the essence of Generation One perfectly. Beyond nostalgia, however, it's also a genuinely enjoyable game. The combat mechanics are exceptionally well-executed, with mid-fight transformations often essential and smoothly integrated into combos—setting it apart from High Moon's excellent *War for Cybertron* and *Fall of Cybertron* games. Another standout feature is the strong emphasis on melee combat, though certain enemies (like Seekers) demand a swift switch to ranged weaponry.

Ironically, I spent more time trying to log in than actually playing. There’s a persistent bug where the game prompts you to accept updated terms of service, but clicking ""accept"" just makes the pop-up reappear—forcing you to restart the client to proceed.  

While that’s inconvenient, the bigger issue is the mandatory linking of Steam and GFace accounts. The justification is DLC access, but why is that necessary? Worse yet, the process is irreversible, meaning a company I have no interest in now has access to my Steam data.  

As for the game itself, it’s mediocre at best. It’s clearly a Call of Duty clone, yet somehow the gunplay feels even worse—which is baffling. How do you manage that?"

In my opinion, it’s genuinely a fantastic and enjoyable game, though the format can be slightly frustrating at times—particularly how the free-roam city repopulates with enemies after each story progression. The 'dual play' segments, where you control Batman alongside another character, were a standout highlight. I also appreciated the flexibility of using a controller for most gameplay while switching to mouse and keyboard for tank combat sections.

When a game is this good, however, its flaws become more noticeable. Here’s what stood out to me:  
- No SLI support—seriously? I had to shelve the game until I upgraded my GPU, as performance was terrible on my old dual-GPU GTX 590. A solid single-GPU card is a must.

- **Gameplay**  
- **Replayability**  

**Graphics:** The game features a comic-like art style. The visuals are sleek, avoiding unnecessary clutter, and the color schemes are well-chosen. This aesthetic perfectly suits the game. Even on higher settings, the graphics don’t strain your system. I run it on an Intel i5 processor with an NVIDIA GeForce 710M card, 8GB RAM (Windows 8.1), and it performs flawlessly.  

**Controls:** The game supports both keyboard and mouse as well as an Xbox controller."

This is everything I hoped a tactical shooter from Call of Duty would be. However, don’t buy this game expecting it to play like COD, Battlefield, or any other mainstream shooter. It stands in a league of its own and should be appreciated as such. I can’t count how many times I’ve heard new players complain about dying too quickly. Seriously—god forbid you get shot in the face and actually die. It’s not like that never happens in real life, right?

The gameplay is solid, the art design is stunning, and the music is unexpectedly high-quality and perfectly fitting. The story and world have me hooked, and the puzzles are genuinely enjoyable. But what truly sets this game apart is its comedy. Whether you're a seasoned RPG player who'll appreciate the jokes, parodies, and references spanning the genre's history, or a newcomer who just enjoys great humor, this game delivers. If you've ever played *Final Fantasy VII* or *X*, this is a must-play—trust me, I had to pause after two hours just to let my cheeks recover from laughing and smiling so much. What an absolute delight so far."
115,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"I genuinely appreciate free-to-play games and indie developers, but unfortunately, this one didn’t resonate with me. While the concept seemed perfect for my tastes, the execution fell flat. As someone who enjoys puzzle and exploration games, I found this title unintuitive—even after consulting guides, the gameplay simply wasn’t engaging. The absence of a pause button (or its obscurity) feels like a significant flaw, especially given the timed sequences. Additionally, the experience leans heavily into cutscenes, leaving me waiting more than playing."
116,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"This game... wow, where do I even begin? It was absolutely stunning, from the story to the graphics—I was completely hooked.

My stomach was in knots the entire time, but I pushed through—for Uncle Fred! If you ever release a DLC or sequel, I’d be the first in line to buy it and recommend it to everyone I know.

What I appreciate about this game is how 2K introduced fresh mechanics, such as the affinity system and orbital layer, offering a unique twist on the classic formula. However, these additions can occasionally feel overwhelming.  

One area I believe could be improved is the artwork—particularly the environments seen during leader interactions, which could benefit from more visual variety and polish."

**Edit:** After playing for 60+ hours, I can confidently say this is one of the better, more 'realistic' zombie games out there. It’s designed like a survival horror—you need to conserve ammo, treat your wounds when bleeding, take pills for infections, and more.  

The zombies feel surprisingly natural and are well-animated for a free-to-play title.

*February 7, 2014* – It’s a shame I can’t fully recommend or enjoy this game because, from the short time I’ve played, I know I’d be hooked if not for two major issues:  

1. **No Australian servers** – A single red bar puts you at a severe disadvantage, causing unbearable lag. Even the offline training mode stuttered and lagged (how does that even happen?). Combined with the poor ping, it completely ruins the experience.  

2. **Excessive artifacting** – The menus, backgrounds, training, and in-game visuals are plagued by artifacts. I’ve never encountered this issue before with my GPU and initially suspected my overclock. However, resetting to stock settings made no difference."

While the story itself isn’t particularly deep or compelling, its storytelling truly sets it apart. The atmosphere is richly immersive, and the numerous collectibles do an excellent job of expanding the world. I learned a great deal about Batman’s universe, though it was a bit disappointing how few boss fights the game included. Still, future installments can easily address that. The combat strikes a good balance in difficulty, leaning slightly toward the easier side. Leveling up Batman didn’t feel especially rewarding, but upgrading and unlocking gadgets throughout the campaign introduced enjoyable new mechanics. Gaining access to previously inaccessible areas provided a satisfying sense of progression."

You think Telltale’s *The Walking Dead* is sad? Well, it doesn’t even come close to *To the Moon*! Never before has something purely fictional left me so deeply moved yet strangely fulfilled. This masterpiece stands, in my opinion, as the pinnacle of storytelling, complemented by a soundtrack that is utterly charming and flawless.  

Admittedly, the controls can feel a bit clunky, and gameplay isn’t its strongest suit—but the story is so extraordinary that none of that mattered to me in the slightest. The humor, too, is brilliantly woven in, never detracting from the story’s emotional weight. And, of course, the endless *Doctor Who* references are just the icing on the cake."

Set in the aftermath of a catastrophic event, your journey revolves around rebuilding the world from the bastion. The game offers a wealth of choices, from deciding which structures to construct for strategic benefits, to selecting weapons, customizing them with power-ups, and choosing drinks that grant bonus effects. The art style and soundtrack are exceptional, with vibrant visuals that prove the apocalypse doesn’t have to be bleak. One of its finest features is the dynamic narration, which reacts to your actions—whether you pick up a weapon or swap it in the armory, the narrator seamlessly comments on your decisions, adding depth to the experience."
123,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"I originally purchased this game during its early development phase, back when the only currency was SpaceBux and there was no 'tech tree' to speak of. That was when the game was at its best. At that time, all the guns were equally overpowered, so balance wasn't an issue—everyone could take down anyone at any moment.  

The game also used to grant unlimited gun slots and five loadouts. You'd think that for a title boasting 'bajillions of guns,' they'd offer more than six weapon slots and three loadouts before locking the rest behind a paywall. At one point, I had around three pages' worth of guns and was brainstorming new ideas for even more because, for me, that was where the real fun lay."

While glowing reviews for products can often be misleading, in this case, they truly captured the enjoyment of this clever little game.

Though I initially hesitated, I decided to try a melee tank—and was pleasantly surprised by how much fun it was, leading me to experiment with more characters as they unlocked through gameplay. The art style and interface have a quirky charm, so much so that I’ve adopted one of the characters as my avatar and even use a wallpaper from the game’s card set creator."

It's been a while since a game has captivated me like this. The music sets the perfect mood, the sound effects are spot-on, and the controls are flawless. I eagerly anticipate every combat encounter—they've optimized the battles exceptionally well. I initially had doubts about the naval combat system, but it's incredibly satisfying to decimate multiple fleets at once! The only way to lose is by failing to retreat. If the fight seems overwhelming, just withdraw, regroup, and strike back. Thank you, devs, for this incredible experience!"

While longtime fans may initially resist these alterations to their beloved character, the improvements are undeniable—and Ninja Theory’s new game demonstrates this masterfully. *DmC* offers the ideal entry point for newcomers, tracing the origins of an arrogant, cynical Dante and documenting his transformation from self-interest to selflessness. The game crafts a clear, engaging narrative arc for this reimagined Dante, making him a captivating figure to follow. The story unfolds as Dante is thrust into the corrupt world he once deliberately turned away from."

Its story is utterly charming, packed with meticulous detail, and brimming with joy—bad puns, pesky dogs, and hidden secrets included. It knows when to be serious but never shies away from humor. The character design is impeccable, featuring a diverse cast with unique personalities and intriguing backstories. What sets it apart from other RPGs is its rare approach: you don’t have to kill anyone, a refreshing twist in the genre. Drawing heavy inspiration from *EarthBound*, one of the finest RPGs I’ve ever played, its quality is undeniable. And the soundtrack? Easily the best I’ve heard in years."
128,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"I recommend this solely because it's free and might offer a more 'enjoyable' experience for some. Personally, the 'game' did nothing for me. Half of the narrative relies on shock value, but I felt neither shocked nor emotionally affected—perhaps I’m desensitized, or maybe it was too simplistic to evoke a reaction. The other half attempts to depict mental decline, exploring themes like obsession, hallucination, and depression. In concept, it’s an interesting idea. However, the 'game' took me just 10 minutes to finish, even while carefully reading and absorbing every detail."

This brilliant approach challenges your mind while keeping the experience enjoyable. Though not heavily story-driven, it spawned one of the most beloved and popular games of 2011. I still revisit this game when I'm bored, completing it time and again—returning to witness the origins of a legend and the legend itself.  

**Gameplay**: *Portal*'s mechanics are deceptively simple to describe. You manipulate portals to solve puzzles, aided by buttons that trigger parts of the environment. There are two types: one you press directly and another that requires placing a weighted cube on it."

Since most reviews focus on specs, here are mine:  

- **CPU:** i5 6600k (~€200)  
- **GPU:** Radeon RX 480 (~€200)  
- **Motherboard:** Z170 Pro-Gaming (~€150)  
- **RAM:** 16GB DDR4 (~€70)  

Totaling around €650, this setup falls squarely in the mid-range price bracket—though admittedly, it’s fairly new. I maintain a near-constant 60+ FPS on high settings with V-Sync enabled. Frankly, I’m baffled by the 90% of comments claiming their overkill rigs struggle to hit 20 FPS."
131,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"Remember Age of Mythology? Yeah, it’s been that long since we’ve seen an RTS game of such high quality. Divinity: Dragon Commander comes awfully close to being one of my personal favorites in the genre. Combine that with a grand strategy mode reminiscent of Risk, and it truly hits the mark. I’ll admit—I try not to be overly biased—but the fact that this game lets you transform into a dragon, supporting your troops, attacking enemies, and even managing unit production and deployment simultaneously is hard to ignore.  

These days, I do appreciate complex RTS games like Civ V and others. However, many of them tend to cram intricate mechanics, charts, and resource systems into a single overwhelming experience."

The graphics hold up well for a retro-style game, and the soundtrack is pleasant, but when combined, they create moments of genuine beauty and emotional impact. The writing spans a wide range—from comedy to drama, heartbreak to hope, often simultaneously—all while subverting classic RPG tropes. And that’s without even delving into the world, characters, story, or gameplay... I could go on for pages. But instead, I’ll keep it simple: if you enjoy RPGs, play this game. If you love video games, play this game. If you have even a few spare hours in your lifetime, play this game."

While the game's mechanics present a reasonably steep learning curve—one I'm still mastering—this depth of strategy offers countless approaches to achieving objectives and capitalizing on opportunities. In my opinion, the game boasts near-endless replayability. Every session draws me in completely, regardless of how my current playthrough unfolds."

However, after that brief period of fun, you'll quickly notice that the game largely revolves around repetitive combat, enemies, and mechanics. The standout positive aspect is the developers' dedication—they release semi-frequent updates that often introduce substantial content, ranging from major system overhauls to new Warframes and various tweaks or features. It's a solid choice for casual play, though it's unlikely to hold your interest for more than a few months unless you genuinely enjoy grinding. The best part? It's free, so I’d still recommend giving it a try. If you're after a quick gaming fix, go ahead and dive in."
136,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"This game is... incredibly dull. I purchased it thinking it would be a PC version of *Katamari Damacy*, a beloved and charming PS2 title. Unfortunately, it falls far short. The core mechanic involves growing larger by absorbing progressively bigger objects, but the gameplay feels clunky, the levels lack creativity, and the overall tone is a surreal horror experience—not the entertaining kind, but one that leaves you feeling bleak and questioning existence. Every ""living"" creature in this game, from tiny pets to humans, makes me suspect the developers had an unsettling fascination with taxidermy."
137,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"Alright, let me explain a few things. As someone deeply interested in politics, I was genuinely excited when I first heard about this game. I thought, *Wow! A simulator about the journey to becoming president? That sounds amazing!* Well, it really wasn’t.  

The game starts by forcing you to pick a side—Republican or Democrat—with no option for an independent or third-party candidate. That was a bit disappointing, but I stayed optimistic to see what else it had to offer.  

I will give the game some credit: the character customization, though limited, is pretty fun to experiment with. It’s the only time you get the choice to wear your head—or not—during a campaign. Literally."

The settlement system disrupts the narrative so much that managing them feels like tedious babysitting rather than enjoying the main plot. Certain keys are hardcoded and can't be remapped. The game is riddled with bugs—at one point, my Pip-Boy vanished permanently, forcing me to dig through console commands to restore it. Power armor lacks the prestige of earlier games; it's handed to you almost immediately, and fusion cores are overly abundant in shops. The story is mediocre, and while the game is more stable than Fallout 3 (which crashed constantly), it still falls short. It doesn't surpass Fallout 3 or New Vegas. Despite the hype, this installment disappoints in nearly every aspect."

**English Review - 73 minutes played:**  
OMFG, just an hour in, and this game is awesome! Some guns feel overpowered, and matchmaking can be unfair at times—but hey, *Battlefield 3* had worse matchmaking. Newbies got paired with high-level players who weren’t even real humans—you could shoot them in the face, and nothing would happen!"

The game is delightfully entertaining, and progressing through it is genuinely enjoyable. ^_^ However, it can get a bit frustrating if you aim to collect every cube and unlock all achievements. To find them all, you’ll need to decode various puzzles—some may take mere seconds, while others might push you to consult a guide (*raises hand*—I admit, I gave up. -_-).

143,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"I can easily understand why others enjoy this game, but it just wasn’t for me. For one, I own a Vive and prefer playing room-scale games with motion controllers. Beyond that, while the game’s vast universe is initially awe-inspiring, I found its sheer scale to be more of a hindrance than a benefit. The steep learning curve and the time required to reach anything engaging early on were simply too much for me. Maybe if I were more patient and had more time for gaming, I’d find it compelling—but I lack both, and there are plenty of other VR titles I’d rather invest my time in."
144,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"Without a doubt, this is my all-time favorite first-person shooter. It’s not for run-and-gun Rambo types. The recoil and ballistics are incredibly realistic—rifle-caliber shots to the chest, neck, or head are almost always fatal unless they barely graze you. Bullets drop over distance, and short, controlled bursts are essential for staying on target. There’s no unlimited ammo here; if you constantly reload mid-magazine, you’ll end up with a pouch full of half-empty clips. Stamina matters too—sprint too long, and your aim wavers as you struggle to catch your breath. For steadier shots, rest your weapon on your elbows when prone or on a window ledge. Standing shots? Expect less accuracy."
145,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"Let me begin by saying I didn’t purchase *XCOM: Enemy Unknown* when it first released—I bought it later on sale, which included *Enemy Within*, so I never encountered the issues some players reported. That said, I thoroughly enjoyed the game. It was challenging early on but incredibly rewarding when executed well.  

As for *XCOM 2*, I’m loving it. The game runs smoothly for me on medium settings, even with a GTX 560 (2GB VRAM). Initially, it defaulted to high settings and had some minor sluggishness, though still playable. Switching to medium improved performance noticeably.  

I’m not sure if I’ve just been fortunate with game performance, but many negative reviews come across as overly entitled to me."

Listen, this game is an absolute blast. Despite the drawbacks I mentioned, there's still plenty of variety and strategic depth. It kicks off fast and only gets more intense.

To tackle these issues, we propose a minimax game framework where spammers and detectors compete based on practical objectives beyond mere detection accuracy. The Nash equilibria of this game yield robust detectors that remain effective against any mixed detection strategies."
202,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"We designed single-shot shaped pulses to achieve ultra-high-fidelity (UH-fidelity) population transfer in a three-level quantum system with a lambda configuration. To guarantee high fidelity, we employed the Lewis-Riesenfeld (L-R) method to derive a family of solutions that enable exact transfer, where each solution adheres to a single dynamical mode of the L-R invariant. Within this family, we identified a tracking solution featuring a single adjustable parameter to simultaneously control the transfer fidelity, excited-state population, and robustness. We quantified robustness for UH-fidelity transfers by measuring the minimum percentile deviation in pulse areas at which the infidelity exceeds \(10^{-4}\). Our shaped pulses demonstrate superior robustness compared to Gaussian and adiabatically optimized pulses, particularly for moderate pulse areas."
203,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"In this work, we investigate the optimization landscape of the population negative log-likelihood function for Gaussian mixture models with an arbitrary number of components. Despite the inherent nonconvexity, which gives rise to multiple local minima that may not be globally optimal—even in well-separated mixtures—we demonstrate that all local minima exhibit a consistent structural pattern. This structure partially identifies the true component centers, as each local minimum either assigns multiple fitted Gaussians to a single true component or fits a single Gaussian to multiple true components, without overlap. Our analysis holds under a specific separation condition for the true mixture components and remains applicable whether the number of components is correctly specified, overestimated, or underestimated. For three-component Gaussian mixtures, we derive more precise results that explicitly characterize the dependence on the separation between components."
204,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"We examine the relationship between two distinct approaches for constructing the mirror partner of a Calabi-Yau orbifold. This orbifold arises as a quotient by an appropriate subgroup \( G \) of the phase symmetries of the hypersurface \( X_m \) in a weighted projective space, defined by a quasi-homogeneous polynomial \( W_m \).  

The first method, known as the Berglund-Hübsch-Krawitz (BHK) construction, employs a different weighted projective space and involves taking the quotient of a new hypersurface \( X_{m^t} \) within it by a dual group \( G^t \).  

The second approach, Batyrev's construction, derives the mirror partner as a hypersurface in a toric variety associated with the reflexive polytope dual to the polytope corresponding to the original Calabi-Yau orbifold.  

We present a straightforward argument supporting the equivalence of these two constructions."
205,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"In this study, we present a generalized approach to human gait analysis, building upon existing models from the literature, such as those by Keller and Kockshenev. This hybrid model integrates a metabolic energy minimization strategy during race processes with a nonlinear description of the mass center's libration movement, aiming to replicate the walk-run transition behavior. Experimental results across various speed regimes demonstrate that the trajectory perimeter of the mass center serves as a significant parameter in quantifying this dynamic. The experimental protocol was implemented in collaboration with the biomedical engineering research group, basic sciences department, and laboratories at Manuela Beltrán University in Bogotá, Colombia."
206,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"We introduce a novel mixed-variable symplectic (MVS) integrator designed for planetary systems, capable of fully resolving close encounters. This method employs a time regularization technique that preserves the stability properties of symplectic integrators while dynamically reducing the effective step size during planetary close approaches. By utilizing a high-order MVS scheme, the algorithm maintains efficiency with large time steps in regions devoid of close encounters. We demonstrate that this approach can accurately resolve near-collisions (with separations as small as a fraction of a planetary radius) while employing the same time-step used for weakly perturbed systems, such as the Solar System. The long-term stability of the method is validated through simulations of six super-Earths undergoing strong gravitational scattering over 50 kyr. Comparisons with hybrid methods like Mercury reveal superior energy conservation at comparable computational cost."
207,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"Entanglement serves as a fundamental resource in quantum information processing. A commonly employed method for detecting entanglement is the entanglement witness, where the measurement of the witness operator yields non-negative results for all separable states but may produce negative values for certain entangled states. In practice, constructing an efficient entanglement witness for general multipartite entangled states is highly challenging due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert-space dimension with increasing system size. For $n$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-like states, the most robust witness scheme necessitates $n+1$ local measurement settings and can withstand up to $1/2$ white noise. In contrast, the most efficient witness for GHZ-like states requires only two local measurement settings and remains effective for white noise levels up to $1/3$."
208,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"Within the framework of general relativity, the Kerr spacetime stands as the unique stationary solution for an isolated black hole, characterized by a distinctive multipolar structure determined solely by its mass and spin. We present a generalized approach to derive the multipole moments of arbitrary stationary spacetimes and apply this method to an extensive class of horizonless microstate geometries. Unlike the Kerr metric, these geometries may violate axial and equatorial symmetry, exhibiting a far more intricate multipolar structure—thereby offering a phenomenological avenue to constrain fuzzball models. Our numerical analysis suggests that, in absolute terms, all multipole moments typically exceed those of a Kerr black hole with equivalent mass and spin. Present measurements of the quadrupole moment in black-hole candidates impose only weak constraints on fuzzball scenarios, whereas future gravitational-wave observations of extreme mass-ratio inspirals via the LISA space mission are expected to refine these bounds by several orders of magnitude."
209,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"Analyzing the evolution of graphs over time presents a significant challenge across various domains, including bioinformatics, physics, and social network analysis. A frequent scenario involves edges representing either short-term interactions (e.g., instant messaging) or long-term structural connections (e.g., friendships). In real-world applications, long-term edges are typically human-defined, which can be both costly to establish and suboptimal for subsequent tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce a model combining temporal point processes with variational autoencoders, designed to automatically infer temporal attention between nodes by analyzing their communication patterns. Since temporal attention governs feature propagation between nodes, learning this critical component from interaction dynamics offers greater adaptability while circumventing the drawbacks of manually specified edges."
210,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"We report observations of thermally induced transverse vibrations in a photonic crystal waveguide (PCW). The PCW comprises two parallel nanobeams separated by a 240 nm vacuum gap. We develop and validate models that transduce beam motion into phase and amplitude modulation of a weak optical probe propagating through a guided mode (GM) of the PCW, both for probe frequencies far from and near the dielectric band edge. As our PCW was designed for near-field atom trapping, this study establishes a framework for assessing potential adverse effects of thermal motion on optical atomic traps near PCW surfaces. Our long-term objectives include achieving robust atom-mediated coupling between individual vibrational phonons and single photons propagating in the PCW's GMs, enabling quantum-level optomechanical interactions among atoms, photons, and phonons."
211,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"We establish natural splittings for the values of global Mackey functors evaluated at orthogonal, unitary, and symplectic groups. Specifically, the restriction homomorphisms between these groups in adjacent dimensions are naturally split epimorphisms. These splittings are of particular interest in equivariant stable homotopy theory, since the equivariant stable homotopy groups of any global spectrum constitute a global Mackey functor. Consequently, the splittings imply that certain long exact sequences of homotopy groups decompose into short exact sequences. In the cases of the real and complex global Thom spectra $\mathbf{mo}$ and $\mathbf{mu}$, these splittings further demonstrate the regularity of various Euler classes associated with the tautological representations of $O(n)$ and $U(n)$."
212,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"Baryonic feedback effects result in a suppression of the weak lensing angular power spectrum on small scales. The insufficiently constrained shape and amplitude of this suppression represent a significant source of uncertainty for forthcoming cosmological weak lensing surveys like Euclid or LSST. In this first paper of a two-part series, we employ simulations to construct a Euclid-like tomographic mock dataset for the cosmic shear power spectrum and its corresponding covariance matrix, both adjusted for baryonic effects using the baryonification approach of Schneider et al. (2019). Furthermore, we develop an emulator to rapidly predict the baryonic power suppression, enabling us to conduct a likelihood inference analysis for a standard ΛCDM cosmology that incorporates both cosmological and astrophysical parameters."
213,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"Spontaneous conversations in natural settings, such as those captured in child-centered recordings, are among the most challenging types of audio to process. However, developing speech processing models capable of handling such diverse conditions would be highly valuable for language acquisition research, where understanding both the quantity and quality of speech children hear and produce is crucial. Such models also hold promise for early diagnosis and assessing remediation outcomes. In this paper, we outline our approach to creating an open-source neural network designed to classify audio segments into four categories: vocalizations by the child wearing the recording device, vocalizations by other children, adult male speech, and adult female speech. To achieve this, we compiled diverse child-centered corpora totaling 260 hours of recordings across 10 languages."
214,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"Density-based clustering operates on the principle of associating groups with specific characteristics of the underlying data's probability distribution. By referencing the true (though unknown) population structure, this approach positions the clustering problem within a standard inferential framework, where the ideal population clustering is defined as the partition generated by the true density function. The nonparametric implementation of this method, termed modal clustering, establishes a connection between groups and the domains of attraction of the density's modes. Practically, this requires a nonparametric density estimate, and careful selection of the smoothing parameter—which influences both the density's shape and its modal structure—is essential for determining the final partition. In this study, we examine the challenge of density estimation for modal clustering from an asymptotic standpoint."
215,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"The tails of diboson production at the LHC exhibit sensitivity to interference effects between Standard Model processes and higher-dimensional operators that parameterize heavy new physics. However, helicity selection rules governing diboson scattering amplitudes create an obstruction to the naive interference contributions from dimension-six operators, leading to a cancellation of the leading-order correction to the total diboson production rate. Remarkably, precise measurements of azimuthal decay angles can ""resurrect"" this interference, thereby restoring sensitivity to these ""non-interfering"" operators. We conduct a detailed investigation of these signatures and demonstrate that the effective field theory (EFT) uncertainties related to higher-dimensional operators are exceptionally well-suppressed through the construction of an asymmetry variable. This observable is uniquely generated by the non-interfering operators, effectively reducing the impact of higher-dimensional, interfering operators to the level of statistical uncertainties in this measurement."
216,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"Causal inference from observational data is a central objective in many health and social science studies. Yet, academic statistics has traditionally viewed causal analyses with skepticism. The emergence of ""data science"" presents a pivotal opportunity to reshape data analysis in a way that inherently supports causal inference from observational data. Following earlier frameworks, we categorize the scientific contributions of data science into three core tasks: description, prediction, and counterfactual prediction (encompassing causal inference). A clear taxonomy of these tasks is essential to examine the data requirements, assumptions, and analytical methods needed for each. We contend that neglecting to articulate the role of domain expertise in data analysis has led to widespread misconceptions about data science."
217,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"The Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) requires the existence of superextremal particles in any consistent quantum theory of gravity. Conventional understanding suggests that these particles are necessary to ensure extremal black holes are either unstable or marginally stable, yet the consequences of violating this condition remain unclear. This note demonstrates that, for a generic Einsteinian quantum theory of gravity in AdS, exact stability of extremal black branes conflicts with rigorously established quantum information theorems concerning entanglement entropy. Resolving this contradiction leads to a nonperturbative formulation of the WGC, which simplifies to the standard statement at weak coupling. The argument is broadly applicable, independent of supersymmetry or specific UV completions, relying only on the validity of Einsteinian gravity, effective field theory, and holography."
218,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"Understanding how strongly correlated two-dimensional (2D) systems can lead to unconventional superconductivity with high critical temperatures remains one of the most significant unresolved challenges in condensed matter physics. Ultracold 2D Fermi gases have become ideal model systems—clean and highly controllable—for investigating the interplay between strong correlations and reduced dimensionality. However, direct evidence of superfluidity in such systems has remained elusive. In this study, we observe superfluidity in an ultracold 2D Fermi gas by moving a periodic potential through the system and detecting the absence of dissipation below a critical velocity \(v_{\rm c}\). We measure \(v_{\rm c}\) across varying interaction strengths and identify a peak in the crossover regime between bosonic and fermionic superfluidity. These results firmly establish ultracold Fermi gases as a versatile platform for exploring the effects of reduced dimensionality on strongly correlated superfluids."
220,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"We investigate the transport properties and superconducting proximity effect in nsn junctions composed of a time-reversal symmetry-broken Weyl semimetal (WSM) coupled to an $s$-wave superconductor. Our results demonstrate that both the differential conductance and induced pairing amplitudes exhibit a pronounced dependence on the angle between the junction's real-space orientation and the momentum-space axis separating the Weyl nodes. We further analyze the impact of a chiral chemical potential—representing the electron population imbalance between Weyl nodes of opposite chirality—on the junction's transport behavior. Notably, we detect a net spin polarization of Cooper pairs generated through Andreev reflection in both WSM regions. This polarization is oppositely oriented in the two regions and exhibits strong sensitivity to both the chirality imbalance and excitation energy."
221,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"The implantation of metal ions into ceramics has proven to be an effective and controllable method for modifying the surface electrical conductivity of ceramic components, with numerous practical applications. Notably, this technique enables the grading of voltage distribution across high-voltage insulators, thereby enhancing their maximum operational voltage capacity by preventing surface flashover. However, a key concern regarding this method is the long-term stability of the conductivity induced by implantation, particularly when the implanted metal species is prone to oxidation. In this study, we investigate the long-term evolution of surface conductivity in titanium-implanted alumina. Our findings reveal that, after an initial decline of up to 40% within the first few weeks post-implantation, the conductivity subsequently stabilizes, exhibiting only a gradual reduction of approximately 10% over the following year."
222,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"We present a novel Skyrme-like conserved current within the effective theory of pions and vector mesons, grounded in the framework of hidden local symmetry. The corresponding charge coincides with the Skyrmion charge for any smooth field configuration. Furthermore, singular configurations emerge that can be interpreted as \(n_f=1\) baryons carrying charge under this new symmetry. In this interpretation, the vector mesons effectively serve as Chern-Simons vector fields residing on the quantum Hall droplet that constitutes the \(n_f=1\) baryon. We argue that this current represents the appropriate low-energy effective description of the baryon current. This perspective provides a unified framework for both types of baryons, enabling their natural continuous transformation into one another. Moreover, Chern-Simons dualities on the droplet can be understood as arising from a Seiberg-like duality between gluons and vector mesons."
223,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"Interfacial spin-orbit coupling in Josephson junctions presents a compelling approach to unify anomalous Hall and Josephson physics within a single device. We theoretically investigate how the interplay of these phenomena influences the transport properties of superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator/superconductor junctions. The spin-dependent skew tunneling of Cooper pairs through the spin-active ferromagnetic insulator interface generates substantial transverse Hall supercurrents, which we term anomalous Josephson Hall effect currents. We extend the Furusaki-Tsukada formula—originally developed to quantify conventional (tunneling) Josephson currents—to assess the transverse current components, revealing that their amplitudes can be widely tuned via spin-orbit coupling strengths or the superconducting phase difference across the junction. As a distinct spectroscopic signature of these Josephson junctions, tightly localized subgap bound states emerge near the interface."
224,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"Building on insights from Monte Carlo experiments in Jiménez (J. Turbul. 2020), which highlighted the equal importance of dipoles and individual vortex cores in decaying two-dimensional turbulence dynamics, this study reveals that the flow's kinetic energy is predominantly transported by elongated streams composed of interconnected dipoles. The vortices segregate into two distinct groups: a collection of compact, rapidly moving cores and a set of larger, quasi-stationary structures resembling a slowly evolving ""crystal."" These families exhibit markedly different kinematic behaviors, with only the former displaying self-similar characteristics. The latter group, which accounts for the majority of the flow's kinetic energy, forms both the dipoles and streams. The paper further examines potential mechanisms driving the development of this slower-moving component."
225,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"Continuous-time quantum walks have emerged as a highly effective framework for designing various quantum algorithms. Typically, the runtime of such algorithms is determined by the quantum hitting time—the duration needed for the quantum walk to locate a target vertex with high probability. In this work, we present refined upper bounds for the quantum hitting time, applicable to numerous continuous-time quantum walk-based algorithms. Specifically, we demonstrate the utility of our approach by enhancing the hitting time upper bound for the glued-trees problem, achieving a polynomial improvement from \(o(n^5)\) to \(o(n^2\log n)\). Additionally, our techniques yield an exponential improvement in the precision dependence for the continuous-time quantum walk algorithm developed by Chakraborty et al., which identifies marked nodes in any ergodic, reversible Markov chain."

Dry (or ""loss-cone"") EMRIs, previously regarded as the primary EMRI sources for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, are mainly generated through multi-body scattering in nuclear star clusters and gravitational capture. In this letter, we emphasize an alternative EMRI formation pathway: wet EMRIs facilitated by the accretion flow surrounding accreting galactic-center massive black holes (MBHs). Within this channel, the accretion disk captures stellar-mass black holes initially on inclined orbits, then induces their migration toward the MBH—significantly enhancing the EMRI formation rate in such galaxies by orders of magnitude."
227,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"When a new user signs up on a website, we typically lack any prior information about them—no item interactions, no user profile, and no social connections with other users. Despite this, we still expect our recommender systems to engage these users immediately, encouraging them to stay on the platform and become active participants. This challenge falls under the new user cold-start category, which is critical to a company's growth and even its long-term viability.  

Existing approaches to user cold-start recommendations either demand additional effort from users, such as completing an interview process, or rely on side information like demographics, location, or social ties [10]. However, users may be reluctant to undergo interviews, and such side information is often unavailable for cold-start users."
228,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"Deep learning has successfully addressed numerous challenges beyond the scope of heuristic algorithms. Its applications have extended to wireless communications, despite existing radio systems being well-understood with optimal algorithms available for many functions. While incremental improvements have been achieved by learning individual receiver components, a more effective strategy involves jointly optimizing the entire receiver system. This approach, however, typically leads to complex nonlinear optimization problems where ideal solutions prove impractical to implement. Addressing this challenge, we present deeprx—a fully convolutional neural network that processes the complete receiver chain from frequency-domain signal streams to uncoded bits while maintaining 5G compliance. To enhance channel estimation accuracy, we carefully design the CNN's input structure by strategically incorporating both data and pilot symbols."
229,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"Mutation-based fuzzing generally begins with an initial set of valid seed inputs (a corpus) that are mutated to generate new test cases. Typically, such corpora contain numerous similar inputs, which can result in redundant fuzzing efforts when exhaustively mutating all available seeds. To mitigate this issue, modern fuzzers incorporate distillation tools (such as afl-cmin) that identify the minimal subset of seeds capable of exercising the same spectrum of code coverage as the complete corpus. Industry experience indicates that reducing both the quantity and total size of seeds enhances fuzzing efficiency—a hypothesis we methodically investigate. Our study presents findings from over 34 CPU-years of fuzzing experiments using five distinct distillation techniques, evaluating their effectiveness in discovering vulnerabilities in production software."
230,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"This paper examines multi-agent discrete-event systems under partial observation. The agents can be categorized into multiple groups, where agents within each group possess similar (isomorphic) state transition structures, allowing them to be relabeled into a common template. Leveraging this template, we design a scalable supervisor whose state size and computational complexity remain unaffected by the number of agents, even under partial observation. Notably, this scalable supervisor maintains its validity without recomputation, regardless of agent additions or removals from the system. We extend our previous findings to partial observation by establishing sufficient conditions for safety and maximal permissiveness of the scalable least restrictive supervisor at the template level. An illustrative example demonstrates the proposed scalable supervisory synthesis approach."

This paper introduces an efficient ENF estimation method using temporal windowing based on the filter-bank Capon spectral estimator. Leveraging the Toeplitz structure of the covariance matrix, we employ a Gohberg-Semencul factorization for computational efficiency. Notably, this approach innovatively incorporates a non-rectangular temporal window prior to spectral estimation—a first in ENF analysis. For rapid matrix inversion, Krylov matrices are utilized. The proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art techniques in ENF estimation, particularly for short 1-second time windows in power recordings. In speech recordings, it achieves superior accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency."

In this study, we investigated the fluorescence anomalous saturation effect in nitrogen-vacancy defects within diamond. Under high-power laser excitation, we observed fluorescence reduction, which enhanced the nonlinearity of fluorescence emission and altered the spatial frequency distribution in the fluorescence image. A differential excitation protocol was employed to extract high-spatial-frequency information. By modulating the excitation laser power, the imaging spatial resolution improved by approximately 1.6 times compared to confocal microscopy. Given the simplicity of both the experimental setup and data processing, we anticipate this method can enhance spatial resolution for sensing and biological labeling applications using solid-state defects."
234,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"When random effects are correlated with design variables in sample surveys, conventional methods that use individual survey weights (constructed as inverses of unit inclusion probabilities) to form a pseudo-likelihood fail to yield asymptotically unbiased inference. We propose a weight-exponentiated formulation for the random effects distribution that enables unbiased inference for hyperparameters governing these effects. Our approach is compared with frequentist methods dependent on numerical integration, demonstrating that only the Bayesian method achieves both design-unbiased estimation and consistency with the population-generating distribution. Through simulations and a real-world application involving business establishment surveys, we illustrate our method's effectiveness across diverse modeling frameworks and sampling designs.

The diminished symmetries of these emerging materials lead to nonuniform electron, optical, valley, and spin responses, along with novel properties such as ferroelasticity, ferroelectricity, magnetism, spin-wave phenomena, enhanced nonlinear optical characteristics, photogalvanic effects, and superconductivity.

For the first time, it was observed that, unlike low-molecular-weight mesogens, the relaxation of electric birefringence in a mesogenic polymer melt above the nematic-isotropic phase transition temperature can be described by a superposition of multiple exponential processes, with two of them being dominant. These primary relaxation mechanisms alternate within a temperature range of approximately fifty degrees. Additionally, dielectric spectroscopy revealed two distinct orientational relaxation processes: the first arising from the rotation of the side mesogenic groups, and the second linked to the motion of the main chain segments."
237,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"Deep hashing methods have demonstrated strong retrieval accuracy and efficiency in large-scale image retrieval. A key challenge in these methods lies in optimizing discrete hash bits effectively. A prevalent approach involves using activation functions such as $\operatorname{sigmoid}(\cdot)$ or $\operatorname{tanh}(\cdot)$, coupled with minimizing a quantization loss to approximate discrete values. However, this strategy risks trapping an increasing number of hash bits in the incorrect saturated regions of the activation functions, making recovery difficult—a phenomenon we term the ""dead bits problem (DBP)."" Moreover, existing quantization losses further exacerbate DBP. To address this issue, we introduce a simple yet effective gradient amplifier applied prior to activation functions, mitigating the impact of DBP."

According to the conventional scenario, an initially circular and narrow belt of planetesimals at semi-major axis *a* acquires an eccentricity *e<sub>f</sub>* through secular perturbations from an eccentric planet after the gas disc dissipates, producing a belt of width *2ae<sub>f</sub>*. A slight variation of this model suggests that narrower belts may form if the planetesimals already possess some initial eccentricity, potentially induced by earlier planetary perturbations during the gas-rich protoplanetary disc phase. Alternatively, such primordial eccentricity could arise from disc instabilities that elevate the disc's eccentricity independently, without requiring the presence of planets."

In one-dimensional (1D) systems, the physics of interacting electrons is effectively described at low energies by the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) model, though experimental observations beyond this linear regime remain scarce. Here, we present measurements of many-body modes in 1D gated wires using tunneling spectroscopy. Our results reveal two distinct Fermi seas at high energies, linked to spin and charge excitations, along with the appearance of three supplementary 1D 'replica' modes that intensify as the wire length decreases. By adjusting the degree of 1D inter-subband screening, we modulate the effective interaction strength in the wires by more than 45%."

This paper reveals an unexpected outcome of popularity-based rankings: when fewer items report a particular signal, they collectively attract a larger share of overall traffic. This 'few-get-richer' effect arises in contexts with limited distinct item categories (e.g., left-leaning versus right-leaning news sources) where rankings are determined by popularity.  

Through analytical modeling, we show this effect emerges when users predominantly click top-ranked items while exhibiting diverse preferences across item categories. Simulations further explore how the effect's intensity varies with different assumptions about the environment and user behavior.

However, most existing pruning methods fundamentally compromise between model accuracy and structural regularity, often resulting in diminished inference accuracy and suboptimal on-device acceleration performance.  

To address this limitation, we propose a novel sparsity dimension called pattern-based sparsity, which combines pattern and connectivity sparsity to achieve both high accuracy and hardware efficiency. Through meticulously designed patterns, our pruning method consistently enhances accuracy and improves feature extraction across various DNN architectures and datasets—an unprecedented achievement. Additionally, our pattern-aware pruning framework seamlessly integrates pattern library extraction, pattern selection, as well as simultaneous pattern and connectivity pruning with weight training.  

This innovative pattern-based sparsity approach naturally aligns with compiler optimizations, enabling highly efficient DNN execution on mobile platforms."
246,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"A difference-in-differences analysis employing a control group that significantly differs from the treated group is susceptible to bias due to historical events affecting the groups differently. Creating a more closely matched control group by selecting a subset of the broader control group may reduce this bias. We investigate this phenomenon through simulation studies. Specifically, we examine the impact of mountaintop removal mining (MRM) on mortality using a difference-in-differences approach, leveraging the increase in MRM activity following the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. In our analysis of MRM's effect on mortality, we developed a more precisely matched control group and obtained a 95% confidence interval encompassing substantial adverse effects, no effect, and minor beneficial effects."
247,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"When developing models to summarize clinical data for simulation purposes, it is essential to assess their ability to accurately reproduce the original data. This evaluation can be performed using visual predictive checks (VPCs), which involve three key steps: (1) generating multiple simulated replicates of the original study using the model being evaluated, (2) computing relevant estimates for each simulated dataset, and (3) comparing the distribution of these simulated estimates with those from the original study. This approach serves as a versatile and generally straightforward validation method. In this context, we specifically examine its application to time-to-event data, with particular attention to cases where time-varying covariates are either unknown or cannot be reasonably estimated after the event occurs."
248,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"Novel concepts, perspectives, and challenges in measuring and controlling open quantum systems through sequential schemes are presented. We examine how analogous protocols, combining repeated quantum measurements with dynamical decoupling control pulses, enable: (i) the confinement and protection of quantum dynamics from decoherence, consistent with Zeno physics; (ii) the analytical prediction of quantum state transfer probabilities via stochastic sequential measurements; and (iii) the optimal reconstruction of environmental noise spectral densities by orthogonalizing frequency-domain filter functions in designed quantum sensors. Accomplishing these objectives will significantly improve our ability to observe and manipulate open quantum systems, thereby advancing quantum science and technologies."

No, you aren’t being hunted by a monster; you’re speaking in public, a fate some consider worse than death. After all, when you’re dead, you feel nothing—but at a podium, you feel every ounce of stage fright. Yet at some point, we’ve all had to address a crowd, so you must learn to push through it.

[The way we work] Approximately 15 percent of American workers don’t hold traditional full-time jobs—they’re part-time, contract workers, or temps. The term ""side hustle"" aligns perfectly with this ethos, capturing how people piece together multiple pursuits to earn a living.  

The phrase ""side hustle"" traces its origins to popular African American newspapers. In the 1920s, ""hustle"" often referred to a scam, but by the 1950s, ""side hustle"" had evolved to include legitimate work. Unlike a second job, which is often driven by necessity, a side hustle reflects a more intentional and varied approach to making ends meet."

Our story begins with the Yap people, a Micronesian culture from the early 1900s, whose unique monetary system offers valuable insights. What makes the Yap particularly interesting is their currency: massive limestone discs known as rai stones. Unlike modern coins that change hands physically, these stones often remain stationary due to their enormous size—some reaching up to four tons and twelve feet in diameter. Instead of moving them, the Yap maintain an intricate system of ownership records for portions of each stone. There's even a legendary account of sailors transporting one such stone across the ocean when disaster struck, causing it to sink beneath the waves."

This was the grim reality for those accused of witchcraft in Salem, Massachusetts, between February 1692 and May 1693. They fell victim to supernatural paranoia, misguided religious zeal—and a justice system that prized repentance over truth.

This is the vision driving bioprinting—an emerging field within regenerative medicine. While we cannot yet produce fully functional complex organs, we have already succeeded in fabricating simpler tissues, including blood vessels and nutrient-exchange conduits.

While Roosevelt was famously passionate about the outdoors, Muir’s invitation extended beyond mere recreation—Yosemite was under threat. Although the valley had been designated as protected land in 1864, by 1903 it still faced the peril of overdevelopment. This struggle was central to a decades-long effort to preserve land for both conservation and public enjoyment—two ideals far more challenging to achieve than to proclaim.

Carbon naturally cycles through ecosystems, existing in all living organisms, as well as in the soil, oceans, atmosphere, and even deep within Earth's rocky layers. When plants and other organisms die, much of their stored carbon gradually returns to the atmosphere, where it can be reabsorbed by new plant growth. However, over geological timescales spanning millions of years, portions of this carbon—originally stored in ancient forests and marine life—transform into sedimentary rock or fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas. While natural processes such as volcanic activity release some of this sequestered carbon, human activities—particularly the combustion of fossil fuels—are now reintroducing vast quantities of this ancient carbon into the atmosphere. In fact, current human emissions exceed annual volcanic carbon releases by approximately sixtyfold."

When fitted with a jet pack or subjected to disruptions like an earthquake, their exquisitely adapted legs enable them to maintain balance effortlessly, without relying on cognitive input. They navigate challenging landscapes, such as dense grass, with ease, never losing stability.

They're profoundly complex—I have no idea how they function. But thinking? That’s straightforward; it’s just logical reasoning or something similar. That part isn’t hard.""  

Here’s a list of problems that arise. One interesting issue is: how do we address health? Recently, I read an article where the author claimed that handshaking in the West is likely the leading cause of disease transmission."
292,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,speech,"What is a parent? It’s not a simple question to answer. In today’s world, we encounter diverse family structures—adoption, stepfamilies, and surrogate motherhood. Many parents grapple with difficult questions and complex decisions. Should we disclose the use of a sperm donor to our child? If so, when is the right time, and how should we phrase it? While sperm donors are often labeled as 'biological fathers,' does the term 'father' truly fit?  

As a philosopher and social scientist, I’ve dedicated my research to exploring these very questions about the nature of parenthood. But today, I want to share what I’ve learned directly from parents and children themselves. Their experiences reveal a profound understanding of what truly matters in a family—even when their family doesn’t fit the traditional mold."
293,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,speech,"When I look in the mirror today, I see a justice and education scholar at Columbia University, a youth mentor, an activist, and a future New York State senator. (Cheers) I see all of that—and a man who spent a quarter of his life in state prison—six years, to be exact, beginning as a teenager on Rikers Island for an act that nearly took a man’s life. But what brought me from there to here wasn’t the punishment I endured as a teenager in adult prison or the brutality of our legal system. Rather, it was the transformative environment of a classroom that revealed possibilities I never imagined—for myself or for our justice system as a whole. Just weeks before my parole release, a counselor urged me to enroll in a new college course offered within the prison."

Or do you see someone oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist? Maybe just an inconvenience at airport security—that one’s actually true. (Laughter) If some of your impressions were negative, I don’t entirely blame you. That’s often how the media depicts people who look like me. Research shows 80% of news coverage about Islam and Muslims is negative. And studies reveal most Americans admit they don’t personally know a Muslim—I suppose people don’t chat much with their Uber drivers. (Laughter) Well, for those who’ve never met a Muslim before—it’s a pleasure to meet you."
295,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,speech,"We must create a water-focused weather service. However, without collective demand for accountability, the necessary funding incentives will remain absent. My first conference presentation was here at TED eight years ago. Fresh from graduate school, I didn't realize those brief minutes on stage would define the questions I'd face for the next ten years. Like many in their twenties, I believed I could solve global challenges—particularly water issues—through technology alone. I had much to learn.  

It was tempting to think our most significant water quality problems persist because they're difficult to detect. I assumed the solution lay in simpler, faster, and more affordable sensors. I was mistaken."
296,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,speech,"Indeed, for two decades, I worked in finance. I was certain I knew everything about the field—the global economy was my life. Any topics you might raise about ecology, the end of the world, and so on—though I knew them inside out—I never truly believed in them. Then, in 2007, an extraordinary event occurred: the subprime crisis, the collapse of major American banks. It was a wake-up call. I had several heated discussions with my wife about it—about my career, about the flaws in the system. Beyond the crisis itself, I came to realize how profoundly mistaken I had been. We were, unmistakably, headed for disaster."

This is one of those magical abilities unique to us humans—the power to convey complex thoughts to one another. Right now, as I speak, I’m shaping sounds with my mouth while exhaling, producing tones, hisses, and bursts of air. These create vibrations that travel through the air, reaching your ears and striking your eardrums. Your brain then interprets these vibrations, transforming them into thoughts—at least, I hope so. (Laughter) I certainly hope that’s what’s happening.  

Because of this remarkable ability, we humans can share ideas across immense distances of space and time. We can transmit knowledge directly from one mind to another."
298,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,speech,"There’s a quote by activist and punk rock musician Jello Biafra that I really admire. He says, *""Don’t hate the media. Be the media.""* As an artist, I enjoy working with media and technology for two reasons: first, because I’m familiar with them and appreciate their influence, and second, because I despise them and am deeply unsettled by the power they wield. *(Laughter.)*  

I recall watching a 2003 interview between Fox News host Tony Snow and then-U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. They were discussing the recent invasion of Iraq when Snow asked, *""We hear about our casualties, but never theirs—why?""* Rumsfeld’s response was chilling: *""Well, we don’t do body counts on other people.""*"

It’s 1988, and scientist James Hansen has just testified before the United States Congress that global warming trends are driven by human activity—and will become an escalating threat to humanity in the years ahead.  

Well, well. That’s remarkably prescient for a human.  

Looking for a wedding dress? Try a fresh twist on a timeless classic. It’s sleek, flattering, and modest—just like the traditional gown.

It’s 1997, and the United States Senate has convened a hearing on global warming. Expert witnesses note that past eras in Earth’s history were warmer than the 20th century."

Another point worth considering is what a privilege it is, as a politician, to deliver a TED Talk—especially here in the U.K., where the standing of politics has plummeted so dramatically since the expenses scandal.  

In fact, I recently came across a story about scientists contemplating replacing lab rats with politicians in their experiments. When someone asked why, the response was: ""Well, there’s no shortage of politicians, few people care what happens to them, and let’s face it—there are some things even rats refuse to do."" *(Laughter)*  

Now, since I know this audience loves data, I’ll begin with a particularly data-rich slide."
