There's been a lot of movie watching going on around here lately. Here's my rundown: last night we watched Thirteen, a movie every mother of a teen should see. It was better than I expected. Then we watched Gigli, yeah it was just as bad as the media said it was, but we had to see for ourselves."

In the first chapter, Casey argues that our contemporary world and culture revolve around time as the primary situating force, as we are constantly running out of time, saving time, or just in time. He posits that centering culture around place offers a more grounded community. So far, this book has been the most engaging read of the semester."

I reassured her that going to the administrator first is the best course of action and that we should work together to address the issue."

I returned to my studies and just as I was finding a little glimmer of understanding buried in my subconscious, the doorbell rang again. Bam, just like that, my breakthrough disappeared. I went to the door and, once again, no one was there. Just what a struggling math student needs, an uninvited practical joker."

Forever will I always be reminded of the very few nights we spent together, hearts and limbs entwined in a soul-embrace, drenched in the salty darkness of an evening by the beach...

We stayed for less than an hour, but the scenery was breathtaking. The falls were calm and serene, and being surrounded by nature had a meditative effect.

There's nothing better than seeing the excitement on a child's face. After the egg hunt, we all went to church.

I think it's important to recognize that symbols, like flags, hold different meanings for different people. While some may view flag-burning as disrespectful, others see it as a form of free speech. The moment you grant a symbol automatic reverence and protection, you're taking a small but significant step towards totalitarianism. Symbols are fleeting and their meanings can shift over time, but their significance is rooted in the way they are perceived by individuals. As such, I believe it's crucial to approach these discussions with sensitivity and respect for different perspectives."

However, Wizards' latest iteration has forgotten this. Players can't earn gold, and gold is crucial for unlocking cards. To make matters worse, there's a daily cap on gold, and grinding against AI or random opponents is a tedious 1v1 experience. Even playing for free takes weeks, if not months, to unlock cards."

The boss fights are awesome, weapons feel very nice (albeit not as good as D44m's ones, but solid), enemies aren't too spongy (if you're not too much of a retard with handling elemental and upgrade stuff). The upgrade system is really balanced and once you get around it, it's not too tedious. The elemental stuff and limited ammo softly forces you to use different weapons. Lots of cool unique weapons that stay viable throughout most of the game. The music is great, especially the main theme, and of course, Stan Bush's stuff."

My player is an outside scorer, PG, 1.71m, with maxed stats and all necessary perks. Okay, and now tell me, why does shooting skill depend on a person's height? Why can't someone with 1.74m become as good a shooter as someone with 1.71m? I'm 1.87m in real life and noticed that I can't reach a higher skill level than 89. Why? That's pure discrimination!

The side characters in this game are all unique and interesting, and I think they really add to the overall experience of the game.

I also think that the side characters are more than just there to be decoration, they have their own agency and contribute to the gameplay in meaningful ways.


They also help to add depth and complexity to the game's world, and they make the game more immersive and engaging.
Overall, I think that the side characters in this game are well-designed and well-integrated into the gameplay, and they are definitely worth paying attention to."

I'd rather play this than any Call of Duty title, but the pay-to-win model is off-putting. If you're okay with this model, then go for it.

I look forward to every combat encounter, and they've done an excellent job with the naval combat system. I was initially skeptical about the naval combat, but it's actually really fun to unleash a barrage of torpedoes and missiles on multiple enemy fleets at once. The only way to lose in this game is to fail to retreat. If things get too tough, just regroup and counter-attack. Thanks to the developers for creating such an amazing experience!"

It's interesting that you mention the game's focus on taxidermy, as it does seem to be a unique aspect of the game. It's not often that games delve into the macabre or unsettling, and it's even rarer for them to do so in a way that's thought-provoking or commenting on real-world issues.
It's possible that the creators of the game were trying to make a statement or commentary on the commodification of life and the way that we ascribe value to living things, or the way that we treat the dead and the things that we no longer need or want. The use of taxidermy in the game could be seen as a metaphor for the way that we treat the dead and the things that we no longer need or want, and the way that we try to preserve and make use of them in various ways.

199,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,paper_abstract,"The paper proposes a novel approach to traffic assignment that considers the impact of autonomous vehicles (AVs) on the traffic network. The approach is based on a bi-level optimization model, in which the traffic assignment is optimized in the upper level, whereas the lower level is a mixed equilibrium simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment model considering a mixed fleet of AVs and HVs. The problem is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem, in which the upper level is a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem, and the lower level is a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem. The objective of the optimization problem is to minimize the total travel time of the vehicles in the network, while satisfying the capacity constraints of the links and the safety constraints of the vehicles.
The paper presents a solution approach that combines the upper and lower levels of the optimization problem using a two-stage method. In the first stage, the upper level problem is solved using a MILP algorithm, which provides an approximate solution of the traffic assignment. In the second stage, the lower level problem is solved using a NLP algorithm, which refines the solution of the upper level problem by considering the nonlinear constraints of the traffic assignment.

For $n$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-like states, the most robust witness scheme requires $n+1$ local measurement settings and can tolerate up to $1/2$ white noise.

We use a tight-binding model to describe the electronic structure of the junction, which allows us to calculate the differential conductance and the pairing amplitudes of the junction.
We find that the differential conductance and the pairing amplitudes strongly depend on the angle between the junction direction in real space and the axis separating the Weyl nodes in momentum space.

239,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,paper_abstract,"This paper shows that the eccentric debris rings around stars Fomalhaut and HD 202628 are narrower than expected in the standard eccentric planet perturbation scenario, sometimes referred to as ""pericenter glow."" The standard scenario posits initially circular and narrow belts of planetesimals at semi-major axis $a$, whose eccentricity is increased to $e_f$ after gas disc dispersal by secular perturbations from an eccentric planet, resulting in a belt of width $2ae_f$. In a minor modification of this scenario, narrower belts can arise if the planetesimals are initially eccentric, which could result from earlier planet perturbations during the gas-rich protoplanetary disc phase. Alternatively, a primordial eccentricity could be caused by instabilities that increase the disc eccentricity without the need for any planets."

It is likely that the globular cluster system of our galaxy has followed a similarly intricate formation path. $Aims. To constrain this formation path, we explore the link between the globular clusters and the known merging events that the Milky Way has experienced. $Methods. To this end, we combined the kinematic information provided by $Gaia$ for almost all galactic clusters, with the largest sample of cluster ages available after carefully correcting for systematic errors. To identify clusters with a common origin, we analyzed their dynamical properties, particularly in the space of integrals of motion. $Results. We find that about 40% of the clusters likely formed in situ."
242,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,paper_abstract,"The estimation of a dataset's intrinsic dimension is crucial for dimensionality reduction techniques. This article introduces 'intrinsic', an r package with novel likelihood-based estimators. The package includes three models: two-nn, gride, and hidalgo. High-level functions provide easy access to these efficient, low-level routines. Intrinsic covers homogeneous and heterogeneous dimension estimators, with frequentist and bayesian inference for the first category. Hidalgo is a bayesian mixture model with an efficient Gibbs sampler."

Two physical rc systems, based on a single magnetic skyrmion memristor (msm) and 24 spin-torque nano-oscillators (stno), were proposed and modeled for image classification and nonlinear dynamic system prediction. Micromagnetic simulation results showed that an rc system using one single msm achieves outstanding performance in handwritten digit recognition. Additionally, complex unknown nonlinear dynamic problems can be well solved by a physical rc system consisting of 24 stnos in a second-order nonlinear dynamic system and NARMA10 tasks."

245,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,paper_abstract,"Weight pruning has been widely recognized as a straightforward and effective method for reducing redundancy in deep neural networks (DNNs), leading to improved acceleration on various platforms. However, most pruning techniques are trade-offs between model accuracy and regularity, which can result in impaired inference accuracy and limited on-device acceleration performance. To address this, we introduce a new sparsity dimension, pattern-based sparsity, which combines pattern and connectivity sparsity, and achieves both high accuracy and hardware friendliness. Our approach consistently enhances accuracy and feature extraction ability on various DNN structures and datasets, and naturally fits into compiler optimization for efficient DNN execution on mobile platforms."

(ii) Analytically predict the probability that a quantum system is transferred into a target quantum state by means of stochastic sequential measurements.

(iii) Optimally reconstruct the spectral density of environmental noise sources by orthogonalizing in the frequency domain the filter functions driving the designed quantum-sensor.

The achievement of these tasks will enhance our capability to observe and manipulate open quantum systems, thus bringing advances to quantum science and technologies.

In summary, the paper proposes a new approach to mitigate decoherence in open quantum systems by combining repeated quantum measurements and dynamical decoupling control pulses. The proposed protocols can be used to predict the probability of a quantum system being transferred into a target state, as well as to reconstruct the spectral density of environmental noise sources. The results have important implications for the development of quantum technologies, such as quantum computing and quantum communication,"

Around 15% of American workers don't have traditional full-time jobs, opting for half-time, part-time, contract, or temp work. This flexible approach is reflected in the term ""side hustle,"" which originated in African American newspapers in the 1920s as a term for a scam. By the 1950s, it came to refer to legitimate work as well. A side hustle differs from a second job in that it's not necessarily driven by necessity."

285,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,speech,"The concept of the experience machine, as proposed by philosopher Robert Nozick, raises several interesting ethical and philosophical questions. The idea of plugging one's brain into a machine that can simulate real life while guaranteeing only pleasure and never pain is a thought-provoking thought experiment that challenges our understanding of what it means to be human and what we value in life.

The experience machine raises questions about the nature of reality, free will, and the value of suffering. If we were to plug our brains into such a machine, would we be sacrificing our humanity or would we be gaining something more valuable?

One of the key concerns with the experience machine is that it would require us to give up our free will. By choosing to plug our brains into a machine that guarantees only pleasure and never pain, we would be giving up the ability to make choices that are not determined by pleasure. This raises questions about the nature of free will and whether we can truly make choices that are not predetermined by external factors. If our choices are not free, are we still truly alive?

Another concern is that the experience machine would replace the natural ups and downs of life with an endless series of ups. Life is full of ups and downs, and these ups and downs are an essential part of what"
