So, when I move my arm too much, mainly with a mouse on a computer, it kills me. I can't move it much now because I was on a spree updating my website and working on other online things. I can barely muster up the strength to draw anything. Lack of sleep adds to my pain. I'm not too happy right now, but I'll get better. My mom's surgery went okay. Her eyesight has come back some. She can see fuzzy shapes and make out colors. Other than that, she's still blind as a bat. Hopefully, she'll fully regain her vision soon."

3. Music: The score could have been more impactful and better supported the narrative, rather than simply relying on a generic, overused soundtrack.

At its core, Magic: The Gathering is meant to be enjoyed with friends (or frenemies) - laughing, trash-talking, and dropping game-winning bombs. However, Wizards has seemingly overlooked this aspect in their digital version. If you choose to play with friends, you can't earn gold, and gold is crucial as it unlocks everything in the game. To make matters worse, they've implemented a daily cap on gold earnings, understandable given its importance. But get ready for a long and boring grind against the computer or random opponents, with whom you can't even communicate. Even playing for free will take you hours each day for weeks, if not months, to unlock the cards."

The upgrade system is really balanced and once you get around it, it's not too tedious. The elemental stuff and limited ammo softly forces you to use different weapons.

Why can't a person with 1.74m become as good in shooting as a person with 1.71m? I'm 1.87m in real life and made my first player with this height and noticed then that I can't reach a higher skill than 89. Why? That's a pure discrimination!

 I also think the collectibles in the game serve a purpose beyond just being collectibles, they actually have a big impact on the story and the gameplay. They help to flesh out the world of the game and give you a better understanding of the characters and their motivations.

I'd rather play this than any Call of Duty title, but the pay-to-win model is off-putting. If you're okay with this model, then have at it.

Despite these issues, I've thoroughly enjoyed the combination of strategy, missions, first-person shooter, and beat-em-up gameplay.

Despite the limited number of boss battles, the combat is well-balanced and satisfying. However, I was slightly disappointed that there were not more bosses in the game. Nonetheless, the gadgets and abilities that are unlocked throughout the campaign add new dimensions to the gameplay.

What sets it apart from other RPGs is that you don't have to kill anyone, a concept that's often overlooked in the genre.

However, the Liberal Democrats have criticized the plan, saying that it could lead to extreme groups dictating what happens on the ground.

However, the effectively linear interaction between motion and light or electricity precludes access to a broader class of quantum states of motion, such as cat states or energy-squeezed states.

Our results are valid for the setting where the true mixture components satisfy a certain separation condition and are applicable even when the number of components is over- or under-specified. For Gaussian mixtures with three components, we obtain sharper results in terms of the scaling with the separation between the components."

We identify the influence of a chiral chemical potential, i.e., the electron population imbalance between Weyl nodes of opposite chirality, on the transport characteristics of the junction.

They propose that this current is equivalent to the skyrmion charge for any smooth configuration, and that it can be identified with the chern-simons charge for the vector mesons.

One of the key features of turbulent flows is the presence of vortices, which are regions of rotating fluid motion. In a turbulent flow, vortices are formed when the flow is accelerated or decelerated, causing the fluid to rotate around a fixed point.
 The study of vortices in turbulent flows is important for understanding the dynamics of these flows and their behavior under different conditions.
In this study, we focus on the dynamics of vortices in a turbulent flow and their interaction with the surrounding flow. We use direct numerical simulations of a turbulent flow to investigate the formation and evolution of vortices, and how they affect the overall flow dynamics.
We find that the kinetic energy of the flow is carried by elongated streams formed by the concatenation of dipoles. These streams separate into a family of small, fast-moving cores, and another family of larger, more slowly moving ones, which can be described as 'frozen' into a slowly evolving crystal.

236,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"Mesogenic polymers are a class of polymers that are derived from a methyl donor and a methyl acceptor. These reactions are reversible, meaning that they can interconvert between each other. In this process, the electric birefringence of the melt is important, as it affects the rate of the reaction.

The first process of orientational relaxation, due to rotation of the side mesogenic groups, is associated with the formation of the racemic products. This process occurs when the methyl group of the methyl donor is in a trans position with respect to the methyl group of the methyl acceptor, resulting in the formation of a tetrahedral intermediate. The second process, associated with the motion of the main chain segments, is responsible for the formation of the cis-isomeric products. In this process, the methyl group of the methyl donor is in an equatorial position with respect to the methyl group of the methyl acceptor, resulting in the formation of a tetrahedral intermediate.
The relaxation of the electric birefringence of the melt is important, as it affects the rate of the reaction. By controlling the degree of relaxation, the yield of the desired isomer can be increased or decreased. This is achieved by adjusting the temperature of the melt, as the rate of the reaction increases with"
239,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"This paper shows that the eccentric debris rings around stars Fomalhaut and HD 202628 are narrower than expected in the standard eccentric planet perturbation scenario, sometimes referred to as ""pericenter glow."" The standard scenario posits an initially circular and narrow belt of planetesimals at semi-major axis $a$, whose eccentricity is increased to $e_f$ after the gas disc has dispersed due to secular perturbations from an eccentric planet, resulting in a belt of width $2ae_f$. However, a minor modification of this scenario suggests that narrower belts can arise if the planetesimals are initially eccentric, which could result from earlier planet perturbations during the gas-rich protoplanetary disc phase. Alternatively, a primordial eccentricity could be caused by instabilities that increase the disc eccentricity without the need for any planets."

It is likely that the globular cluster system of our galaxy has followed a similarly intricate formation path. To constrain this formation path, we explore the link between the globular clusters and the known merging events that the Milky Way has experienced.

To this end, we combined the kinematic information provided by $Gaia$ for almost all galactic clusters, with the largest sample of cluster ages available after carefully correcting for systematic errors. To identify clusters with a common origin, we analyzed their dynamical properties, particularly in the space of integrals of motion.

However, most pruning techniques are trade-offs between model accuracy and regularity, leading to impaired inference accuracy and limited on-device acceleration performance. To address this, we introduce a new sparsity dimension, pattern-based sparsity, which comprises pattern and connectivity sparsity, and achieves both high accuracy and hardware friendliness. Our approach consistently enhances accuracy and feature extraction ability on different DNN structures and datasets, and our pattern-aware pruning framework achieves pattern library extraction, pattern selection, pattern and connectivity pruning, and weight training simultaneously."

We examine the impact of mountaintop removal mining (M&RM) on mortality using a difference-in-differences analysis that utilizes the increase in M&RM following the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments. For a difference-in-differences analysis of the effect of M&RM on mortality, we constructed a more closely matched control group and found a 95% confidence interval that contains substantial adverse effects, as well as no effect and small beneficial effects."

The achievement of these tasks will enhance our capability to observe and manipulate open quantum systems, thus bringing advances to quantum science and technologies.

In the paper, the authors propose and demonstrate protocols for controlling and measuring open quantum systems using a combination of quantum entanglement and classical control theory. The key idea is to use repeated quantum measurements and dynamical decoupling control pulses to confine and protect quantum dynamics from decoherence, which is the loss of quantum coherence due to interactions with"

These were large, heavy limestone discs that were used as a form of currency. The Yap did not use coins or paper money like many other cultures, but instead, they kept track of who owned which part of which stone.
The largest rai stone is about four tons and 12 feet across, so it's not something you can easily move around or trade with. Instead, the Yap kept track of who owned different parts of the stone, kind of like a big, shared checkbook. There's a story about some sailors who were transporting a stone across the ocean when they ran into trouble and the stone actually fell into the ocean. Since then, the Yap have continued to use rai stones as their form of money, even though it's not exactly portable or easy to divide. It's a unique and fascinating system that has been in use for centuries."

The idea is to imagine a machine that can simulate real life experiences while guaranteeing only pleasure and never pain. The experiment asks us to consider whether we would choose to sign up for such an existence, where our experiences would be indistinguishable from reality.

At first glance, the idea of a pleasure-only machine may seem appealing, as it would eliminate the unpleasantness and hardships that are inevitable parts of life. However, there are several reasons why I would not want to sign up for such an existence.

Firstly, while the machine may provide an endless series of pleasurable experiences, it would lack the richness and depth that come with experiencing life's ups and downs. Life is not just a series of pleasant moments, but also involves struggles, challenges, and growth. By removing the possibility of pain and hardship, the experience machine would rob us of the opportunity to learn and develop as individuals.
