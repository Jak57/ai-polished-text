'Blow Out' is a wildly creative concept that defies expectations with its all-star cast. Jonothan Antin, the renowned hairstylist, is expanding his popular West Hollywood salon to Beverly Hills, much to the delight of his loyal followers. I can't get enough of his larger-than-life personality and grandiose plans for the new location. It's been a while since I've found a character as captivating as Rocco, and Jonothan is quickly becoming my new obsession."
3,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"This week, I have been experiencing discomfort in my right shoulder due to tendonitis. The inflammation is located just under my shoulder blade, and it becomes particularly bothersome when I perform repetitive tasks, such as using a computer mouse. My range of motion has been limited as a result, and I am finding it challenging to move my arm freely.
I have been dealing with this issue for some time now, and it has been exacerbated by my recent spree of updating my website and working on other online tasks. I am not able to move my arm as much as I would like to due to the pain, and lack of sleep has only made the situation more challenging. Fortunately, my mother's surgery went well, and her eyesight has partially returned. She is able to make out fuzzy shapes and colors, but she remains blind in all other respects. I hope that her vision will fully recover soon."

Before Pat shows up to lunch, Dustin starts talking about what a nice guy Pat is and how he's trying to find a girlfriend for him. I'm listening and nodding, realizing that we're talking more about finding Dustin's best friend, a girl, than discussing whatever it is you discuss with a stranger over pink lemonade.

I threw away the sweater I was knitting because it had too many stitches by the time I got to the arm holes, and the mohair was knotting itself together as I knitted.

I just morosely ripped and listened to Season 2 of Sex and the City (way to go, library!). Then I got sick of it and threw it away. I suppose I learned a lot while trying to do this sweater."

The first chapter explores the concept of ""implacement"" and the second, ""displacement."" Casey argues that our contemporary world and culture revolve around time as the central force, with a focus on running out of time, saving time, and being just in time. He posits that shifting the center of culture to place can lead to a more grounded community. So far, this book has been the most engaging read thus far."

I completed three books: Bruce Sterling's 'Heavy Weather,' Larry Niven's 'World of Ptavvs,' and Octavia Butler's 'Parable of the Sower.' While I found the stories engaging and well-crafted, I didn't experience any profound emotional resonance. The characters and plot were well-developed, but the books failed to leave a lasting impact. Nonetheless, it was an enjoyable weekend of intellectual exploration."

It was a hidden epidemic that only now is coming to light. I was initially burdened by the experience, but speaking with the course coordinator allowed me to release my burden and, in doing so, I prevented another student from suffering the same fate. Yesterday, I encountered another aggrieved classmate who was determined to inform the student who was scheduled to attend the next practicum about the difficulties. I calmed her down and advised her to speak with the administrator first."

I was not then nor am I now a math person. I hate math. I am math phobic. You get the picture. So, as I struggled to make sense of algebra, the doorbell rang. I put down my book and went to open the door. No one was there. Great. I returned to my studies and just as I was finding a little glimmer of understanding buried in my subconscious, the doorbell rang again. Bam, just like that, my breakthrough disappeared. I went to the door and, once again, no one was there. Just what a struggling math student needs, an uninvited practical joker."

If I knew I was moving before the end of the school year, I would have discarded unnecessary books and supplies. Unfortunately, everything came with me. So, this week was spent moving, unpacking, and purging profusely. I have to thank my teammate Jill for helping with all of this.

Forever will I always be reminded of the very few nights we spent together, hearts and limbs entwined in a soul-embrace, drenched in the salty darkness of an evening by the beach...

Just before the new citizens left, an immigration official directed them to stop by a voter registration table - a common sight at naturalization ceremonies. However, this table was unusual, as the volunteers handing out forms were Republican, and the party affiliation box had been checked off ahead of time, making all of the new voters members of the GOP without their knowledge or consent. Linda Cross was there to watch her husband, Dario Cruz, take his citizenship oath, and she was not pleased with the GOP's actions."

As a non-American blogger, I've been hesitant to weigh in on these discussions, particularly those involving flags, but since I started writing about it (the subject, not the act of flag-burning), I suppose I should say something. Firstly, I believe that having a law against flag-burning is completely nonsensical. The moment you afford a symbol automatic reverence and protection, you're taking a small but significant step towards totalitarianism. Symbols are fleeting and their meanings are subjective - it's their interpretation that matters, not the symbol itself."

In the old days, when we asked for resolutions evidencing the authority to enter into the master agreement/derivative transactions, we frequently received the resolutions without reviewing them thoroughly. Now that we are entering into a new era of energy trading, we want to make sure that we are aware of any potential risks and have a process in place to mitigate them.


To that end, I recommend that we review the resolutions contained in Lotus Notes and ensure that they are up-to-date and relevant to our current business needs. If there are any discrepancies or ambiguities in the resolutions, we should work with our legal and compliance teams to clarify them and ensure that they are consistent with our master agreement and other relevant agreements.
In addition, I suggest that we establish a process for regularly reviewing and updating the resolutions to ensure that they remain relevant and effective in the face of changing market conditions and regulatory requirements. By doing so, we can minimize the risk of errors or omissions in our transactions and ensure that we are operating in compliance with all relevant laws and regulations."

I dislike pre-quarters as they go against the narrative flow and feel like a step backward in storytelling. While they provide additional story content, the combat feels clumsy and doesn't have the same sharpness as Arkham City's. As of October 23, 2013, there is a game-breaking bug that prevents a side mission from being completed (main story unaffected). Some gadgets are assigned to obscure keyboard hotkeys, making it difficult to access them during combat.

The boss fights are awesome, weapons feel very nice (though maybe not as good as D44m's), and enemies aren't too spongy (if you're not too bad at handling elemental and upgrade stuff). The upgrade system is well-balanced, and once you get the hang of it, it's not too tedious. The elemental stuff and limited ammo forces you to use different weapons. There are lots of cool unique weapons that stay viable throughout most of the game. The music is great, particularly the main theme, and of course, Stan Bush's contributions."

I lost my main character around hour 10 of 20ish, and would have appreciated a save to reload at that point. I've since picked up a 3rd party mod/save tool to avoid catastrophic failures. The aiming reticule is on the small side, and the zoom is underpowered. Despite these issues, it's been a blast. I'm not normally a zombie fan, but the combination of strategy, missions, and first-person shooter/beat 'em up gameplay is great. I've been playing it as often as I can get away...

I couldn't find the gameplay engaging, and even after looking up how to progress, I couldn't enjoy it. The lack of a pause button was particularly frustrating, as many sequences are timed, making it difficult to take breaks.

The atmosphere is filled to the brim and the many collectibles do a great job at fleshing it out. I did learn a lot about the world of Batman, so it was a little disappointing that so few bosses were in the game. Oh well, there's enough future games to rectify that. The combat is the right amount of challenge, but it's more on the easy side. Leveling up Batman wasn't very satisfying. It's the gadgets you upgrade and acquire during the campaign that add nice new gameplay mechanics. Getting access to previously unreachable places makes for a nice sense of progression."

All guns were equally overpowered, so there were no balance issues; everyone could kill anyone at any time. Additionally, the game provided unlimited gun slots and five loadouts. It's frustrating that for a game with 'bajillions of guns,' they only give you six weapon slots and three loadouts before you have to pay. At one point, I had around three pages of guns and was planning on coming up with new ideas, as I found it fun."

The controls are intuitive and responsive, and I look forward to every combat encounter. I was initially skeptical about the naval combat system, but it's surprisingly fun to unleash a barrage of attacks on multiple fleets at once. The only way to lose in this game is to fail to retreat. If the combat looks too overwhelming, just step back, regroup, and counter-attack. Thank you to the developers for creating such an enjoyable experience!"

While some fans may be displeased with the alterations to their beloved character, the new game by Ninja Theory demonstrates why these changes are for the better. DMC serves as an ideal entry point for newcomers to the series, showcasing the origins of an arrogant, cynical Dante and his transformation from cynicism to selflessness. The game's narrative arc effectively makes the new Dante a compelling character to watch, as he navigates a corrupt world he willfully ignored."

The attention to detail is impressive, with a rich tapestry of characters each with their own unique personalities and secrets. What sets it apart from other RPGs is its non-violent approach, a breath of fresh air in a genre often dominated by bloodshed. Inspired by Earthbound, one of the best RPGs I've seen, it's clear that this game has the potential to be something special. The soundtrack is equally impressive, with a soaring and uplifting score that will leave you smiling. Overall, this game has me excited for what's to come."

The game's reliance on shock value was not effective in eliciting a response from me.

However, the brevity of the game (10 minutes) and lack of depth in its execution left me unmoved."

131,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"I completely agree with you! Divinity: Dragon Commander is a fantastic game that offers a unique blend of real-time strategy and fantasy elements. The ability to play as a dragon and command your troops from the skies is incredibly immersive and adds a new layer of depth to the gameplay. The risk-like grand strategy aspect of the game also adds an extra layer of challenge and replayability, as you have to carefully manage your resources and make strategic decisions to ensure your faction's success.

I too have found that I prefer more complex RTS games like Civilization V and the like, where the gameplay is more slow-paced and there is more depth to the game mechanics. However, I do appreciate the challenge and depth that these types of games offer, and I think they are great for players who enjoy a more strategic and thoughtful gameplay experience."

In the opening 45 minutes, United had looked unlikely to earn the win they needed to keep their title hopes alive, their approach play was more labored than patient and they managed to fashion just one chance - a Paul Scholes header over the bar."

The ability to manipulate and control these oscillators has the potential to revolutionize the processing and communication of quantum information and precision force sensing beyond the standard quantum limit. However, the linear interaction between motion and light or electricity hinders access to a broader class of quantum states, such as cat states or energy-squeezed states. Early optomechanical proposals suggested the possibility of strong quadratic coupling of motion to light to escape this restriction. Although there have been experimental demonstrations of quadratically coupled optomechanical systems, these have not yet accessed non-classical states of motion."

Our results hold for the setting where the true mixture components satisfy a certain separation condition and are valid for both over- and under-specified models.

Traditional GNNs rely on explicit edge information, which can be time-consuming and suboptimal to obtain, especially for large-scale networks. The proposed method, called Temporal Point Processes and Variational Autoencoders for Inferring Temporal Attention in Graphs (TPP-VAE), leverages temporal point processes and variational autoencoders to learn the dynamics of node interactions and infer temporal attention between nodes. The key idea is to observe the temporal interactions between nodes and use the resulting dynamics to learn the attention patterns between them.
The authors evaluate their approach on several real-world social networks and demonstrate its effectiveness in capturing subtle patterns in the data that are not captured by traditional GNNs. They show that TPP-VAE outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency, and provides a more flexible and interpretable way of modeling temporal attention in social networks."

The authors define modal clustering as the partition of the data into groups, where each group is characterized by a density mode, which is a point in the data space where the density of the data is maximized. The density modes are obtained by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true density of the data and a probability distribution, which is used as an approximation to the true density.The proposed method, called modal clustering, consists of two main steps: (1) density estimation, and (2) clustering.

However, helicity selection rules for the diboson scattering amplitudes impose an obstruction to the naive interference contributions of dimension six operators, suppressing the leading contribution to the total diboson rate correction. In this case, measuring the azimuthal decay angles ""resurrects"" the interference, allowing for sensitivity to the ""non-interfering"" operators. We explore these signatures in detail, and find that the EFT uncertainties associated with higher-dimensional operators are uniquely well-suppressed by the construction of an asymmetry variable that is generated only by these non-interfering operators, relegating the effects of higher-dimensional, interfering operators to the same status as statistical errors in this observable."
217,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"The argument you are referring to is indeed a famous result in the field of quantum gravity and black hole physics, known as the ""Waldinger-Hawking no-go theorem"". It states that it is impossible to consistently combine the principles of general relativity and quantum mechanics in a theory of quantum gravity, at least in the sense of producing a unitary and causal theory.

The proof of this theorem is based on the idea that the entanglement entropy of a black hole, which is a measure of the quantum information contained in the black hole, is not a local quantity, but rather a non-local one. Specifically, it is proportional to the area of the event horizon of the black hole, and its value cannot be determined by local measurements within the black hole.
This means that any local theory of quantum gravity that attempts to describe the black hole must either be inconsistent with the principles of general relativity, or it must introduce non-local degrees of freedom, which are not present in classical general relativity.
The no-go theorem has been a major challenge in the development of a consistent theory of quantum gravity, as it seems to rule out many promising approaches to the problem. However, it has also led to the development of new ideas and approaches, such as loop quantum gravity and string theory, which attempt to avoid the contradiction by introducing new degrees of freedom and non-locality."
218,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"Understanding how strongly correlated two-dimensional (2D) systems can exhibit unconventional superconductivity at high critical temperatures is a major unsolved problem in condensed matter physics. Ultracold 2D fermi gases have emerged as clean and controllable model systems to study the interplay of strong correlations and reduced dimensionality, but direct evidence of superfluidity in these systems has been lacking. We demonstrate superfluidity in an ultracold 2D fermi gas by moving a periodic potential through the system and observing no dissipation below a critical velocity, v$_{\rm c}$. We measure v$_{\rm c}$ as a function of interaction strength and find a maximum in the crossover regime between bosonic and fermionic superfluidity. Our measurement establishes ultracold fermi gases as a powerful tool for studying the influence of reduced dimensionality on strongly correlated superfluids."

The authors consider a two-dimensional model with a chiral junction and use the Weyl node approach to calculate the differential conductance and pairing amplitudes. They find that the spin polarization of cooper pairs is strongly dependent on the angle between the junction direction in real space and the axis separating the Weyl nodes in momentum space.
The authors also identify the influence of a chiral chemical potential, i.e., the electron population imbalance between Weyl nodes of opposite chirality, on the transport characteristics of the junction. Remarkably, they observe a net spin polarization of cooper pairs that are generated via andreev reflection in the two WSM regions. The spin polarization is opposite in the two WSM regions and highly sensitive to the chirality imbalance and excitation energy.""

Under this identification, vector mesons play the role of Chern-Simons vector fields living on the quantum Hall droplet that forms the $n_f=1$ baryon. We propose that this current is the effective expression for the baryon current at low energies. This proposal provides a unified picture for the two types of baryons and allows them to continuously transform one into the other in a natural way. Furthermore, Chern-Simons dualities on the droplet can be interpreted as a result of Seiberg-like duality between gluons and vector mesons."

The authors use the vortex method to generate a family of fast-moving cores, which are separated into a family of small, fast-moving vortices, and another family of larger, slowly moving ones. The fast-moving vortices are responsible for the high-frequency components of the flow, while the slowly moving vortices are responsible for the low-frequency components.

An alternative channel for wet EMI formation is assisted by the accretion flow around accreting galactic-center massive black holes (MBHs). In this channel, the accretion disk captures stellar-mass black holes on inclined orbits and drives them towards the MBH, boosting the formation rate of EMRIs in such galaxies by orders of magnitude."

The authors used a differential excitation protocol to extract the high spatial frequency information from the fluorescence emission. They found that the nonlinearity of the fluorescence emission increased the spatial resolution of imaging by approximately 1.6 times in comparison with confocal microscopy. The authors expect that this method can be used to improve the spatial resolution of sensing and biological labeling with the defects in solids.
 The use of high-power femtosecond laser excitation allows for higher spatial resolution imaging, as the nonlinearity of the fluorescence emission increases the amount of information that can be obtained from a single image. This can be particularly useful for imaging materials with defects, as the high spatial resolution can allow for the detection of small defects that may not be visible using lower-power excitation.

The study also highlights the simplicity of the experimental setup and data processing, which makes it a promising method for practical applications.

This process is characterized by a decrease in the birefringence of the side groups with increasing temperature, resulting in a shift of the orientation of the molecule from nematic to isotropic.
The second process is associated with the motion of the main chain segments, which occurs on a shorter timescale than the first process. This process is characterized by a decrease in the birefringence of the main chain segments with increasing temperature, resulting in a decrease in the overall birefringence of the molecule.
The relaxation of the electric birefringence of a melt in a nematic-isotropic transition can be described using a sum of several exponential processes, with the first and second processes playing a decisive role. These main processes replace each other in a temperature range of about fifty degrees.

The standard scenario assumes that the eccentricity is increased to $e_f$ after gas disc dispersal by secular perturbations from an eccentric planet, resulting in a belt of width $2ae_f$. However, narrower belts can arise in a minor modification of this scenario if the planetesimals are initially eccentric, which could result from earlier planet perturbations during the gas-rich protoplanetary disc phase. Alternatively, a primordial eccentricity could be caused by disc instabilities that increase the disc eccentricity without the need for any planets."

The tunnelling spectroscopy technique involves shining a laser beam through the wire and measuring the energy distribution of the electrons in the wire. By varying the energy of the laser beam, the electrons in the wire are excited to different energy levels, and the resulting energy distribution is measured.

By creating a more closely matched control group, we were able to estimate the specific effect of MRM on mortality with greater precision, as any differences between the groups that are not due to the treatment are likely to be due to other factors that are similar in both groups.

247,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"We can use the bootstrap method to estimate the distribution of the response variable of interest (e.g., the probability of the event) at different time points) in the simulation. The basic idea is to use the observed data to estimate the expected value of the response variable at each time point in the simulation, and then use the observed data to estimate the expected value of the response variable at each time point.



 The bootstrap method involves resampling the observed data with replacement, where each observation is replaced by a new observation generated from the original data and the simulation process. The number of bootstrap replications is typically set to a large value, such as 1000 or 1000, to ensure that the estimate is robust and reliable. The bootstrap estimate of the response variable is then calculated by aggregating the values of the response variable across the bootstrap replicates.

The bootstrap method can be used to estimate the distribution of the response variable in the simulation, which can be useful for evaluating the accuracy of the simulation and for making inferences about the population of interest. However, the bootstrap method is not a panacea for all problems, and it is important to consider the assumptions and limitations of the method when interpreting the results."

The achievement of these tasks will enhance our ability to observe and manipulate open quantum systems, thus advancing quantum science and technologies.

The article highlights the importance of understanding and controlling decoherence in open quantum systems, which is a major obstacle in the control and manipulation of quantum systems. Decoherence arises due to interactions between the quantum system and its environment, causing the system to lose quantum coherence and behave classically.

To overcome decoherence, the authors propose the use of sequential quantum error correction protocols, which involve repeated quantum measurements on the system to estimate the error and correct it.

Muir had invited Roosevelt to Yosemite to raise awareness about the park's vulnerability to overdevelopment, despite its protection in 1864. The struggle to set aside land for preservation and public use had been ongoing since the 1849 gold rush, and Yosemite was at the heart of the battle."

(Applause) My ambition has always been to be a pilot and fly a plane, to feel free to soar through the sky, to touch the sky. But that didn't happen. Unfortunately, I live in Gaza, and there is no airport. All borders are closed on every side. We live in one of the biggest prisons in the world. The only thing I can do is look up at the sky. On some days, we're lucky if we have electricity for four or five hours. When it's cold, we make a fire on the front or on the roof of our homes."
282,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"I'm sorry I can't show you my face, as it could put me in danger. My journey as an undercover journalist began 14 years ago. As a young reporter fresh out of college, I uncovered a simple yet powerful story of police officers accepting bribes from street vendors. I decided to take a different approach, immersing myself in the scene to gather hard evidence. The impact was significant, and it's what many call immersion journalism or undercover reporting."
285,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"The thought experiment proposed by philosopher Robert Nozick, known as the ""Experience Machine,"" raises interesting questions about the nature of happiness and the human experience. The idea is to imagine a machine that can simulate real life while guaranteeing only pleasure and never pain. The thought experiment asks us to consider whether we would choose to plug our brains into such a machine if it were possible.

The appeal of the experience machine is that it would eliminate the unpleasant aspects of life, such as pain, suffering, and hardship, and provide a constant stream of pleasure and enjoyment. It would be like living in a dream world where everything is perfect and nothing can go wrong.
However, there are several reasons why I would not want to plug my brain into such a machine.
Firstly, I believe that life is not just about pleasure and happiness. Life is a complex and multifaceted experience that includes a wide range of emotions, including sadness, anger, fear, and disappointment. These negative emotions are an integral part of the human experience and help us to grow and learn as individuals. They also help us to develop empathy and compassion for others, and to appreciate the good times in our lives.
Secondly, I do not think that it is possible to truly replicate the richness and depth of human experience through"
286,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"I would like to share with you a personal anecdote about the most embarrassing experience I've had as a palliative care physician. A few years ago, I was consulted to see a woman in her 70s - a retired English professor who had pancreatic cancer. I was asked to see her because she was experiencing pain, nausea, and vomiting. During the consultation, she asked me if I thought medical marijuana might help her. As I reflected on my medical knowledge, I realized that I had learned absolutely nothing about medical marijuana in medical school. In fact, it didn't take long to recall that I had learned nothing about it at all. This experience was particularly embarrassing because the patient was an elderly woman who was suffering from a serious illness, and I, as her physician, was unable to provide her with the appropriate guidance and support. It was a humbling moment for me, and it highlighted the need for further education and training in this area of medicine."

As a firefighter, my team and I are tasked with saving lives and property from various disasters, including car wrecks, house fires, and life-threatening medical emergencies. As a woman in a male-dominated profession, I have also seen firsthand the importance of having a diverse team, and 10 years ago, I decided to further my medical knowledge by obtaining a nursing degree. This was in response to the realization that the next major threat facing not only my city, but other cities across the country, was not the one-and-done disaster, where firefighters ride in, put out the fire, and leave, feeling like they have made a difference and everything is okay."

When living things die, some carbon is released back into the atmosphere, but some becomes fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas. Volcanic eruptions and human activities like burning fossil fuels release more carbon into the atmosphere. Humans release 60 times more carbon than volcanoes each year."
289,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"Even nature's most repulsive creatures hold vital secrets, but who desires a swarm of cockroaches approaching? Yet, a key difference between natural and human technologies lies in resilience. Robust systems remain stable in unfamiliar environments. Remarkably, cockroaches can self-stabilize on rough terrain with remarkable ease. When we added a jet pack or subjected them to an earthquake, we found their exquisitely tuned legs allowed them to maintain balance without cognitive effort. They can navigate complex terrain with ease, like grass, without becoming unstable. We discovered a novel behavior where, due to their shape, they automatically roll to their side to navigate this artificial test area. Robust systems can perform multiple tasks with the same structure. Here's a new behavior we've discovered."

And so, I would like to cheer you up with one of the great, albeit largely unknown, commercial success stories of the past 20 years. Comparable, in its own very peculiar way, to the achievements of Microsoft or Google. And it's an industry which has bucked the current recession with equanimity. I refer to organized crime.

Now, organized crime has been around for a very long time, I hear you say, and these would be wise words, indeed. But in the last two decades, it has experienced an unprecedented expansion, now accounting for roughly 15 percent of the world's GDP. I like to call it the global shadow economy, or McMafia, for short.

So, what triggered this extraordinary growth in cross-border crime?"

(cheering) I see all of that and a man who spent a quarter of his life in state prisonâ€”six years, to be exactâ€”starting as a teenager on Rikers Island for an act that nearly cost a man his life. But what got me from there to here wasn't the punishment I faced as a teenager in adult prison or the harshness of our legal system. Instead, it was a learning environment of a classroom that introduced me to something I didn't think was possible for me or our justice system as a whole. A few weeks before my release on parole, a counselor encouraged me to enroll in a new college course being offered in the prison."

The portrayal of Muslims in the media is a major problem, and it's not just about the media. It's about how these negative portrayals shape our perceptions of Muslims and Islam.

Studies have shown that an overwhelming 80% of news coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative. And let me tell you, it's not just the news."
295,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"We need to build a weather service for water. Until we collectively demand accountability, the incentives to fund it will not exist. The first time I spoke at a TED conference was eight years ago, fresh out of grad school. Little did I know that in those few minutes on stage, I was framing the questions I would be asked for the next decade. And, like many 20-somethings, I expected to solve the world's water problems - more specifically, the world's water quality problems - with my technology. I had a lot to learn. It was seductive to believe that our biggest water quality problems persist because they're so hard to identify. And I presumed that we just needed simpler, faster, and more affordable sensors. I was wrong."

As a politician, it's an honor to give a TED Talk, especially in the UK where politics has been tainted by the expenses scandal. Scientists even considered replacing politicians with rats in experiments due to their abundance and the fact that ""there are some things that rats just won't do."" I begin with a data-rich slide."
