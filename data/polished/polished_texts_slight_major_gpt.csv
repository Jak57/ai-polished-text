We may receive the keys at closing, and I'm getting so excited. If everything goes smoothly this week, we'll be ready to close a week from Wednesday. I was up until after 3:00 a.m. last night watching movies with Bethany; there's been a lot of movie-watching going on around here lately. Here's my rundown: last night we watched ""Thirteen,"" which is a film every mother of a teenager should see. It was better than I expected. Then we watched ""Gigli."" Yes, it was just as bad as the media claimed, but we had to see for ourselves."
2,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,blog,"Summer television used to be a wasteland of reruns, but now two fantastic new shows have caught my attention, both of which I've been following religiously over the past week. One of them, ""Blow Out,"" boasts the most flamboyant concept, yet oddly features no openly gay individuals. The show follows hairstylist Jonathan Antin as he ambitiously plans to open a second branch of his wildly successful West Hollywood salon in the upscale area of Beverly Hills. Typically, such a venture wouldn't capture my interest, yet as I was browsing through channels, I stumbled across Jonathan—exuding equal parts narcissism and blandness—as he gazed at a vacant space on Rodeo Drive and declared with grandiosity, ""I am going to build the greatest salon in the history of the world right here!"" And at that moment, I was hooked. Not since the days of Rocco have I found such a captivatingly foolish persona on television."

Every time I use the computer mouse, it causes me significant pain, so I have to limit my arm movements. I recently went on a spree updating my website and working on other online projects, which has left my arm extremely painful. Now, it's difficult to even summon enough energy to draw. The lack of sleep only adds to my discomfort. Although I'm not feeling very positive at the moment, I'm hopeful for recovery. On a brighter note, my mom's surgery went well. Her eyesight has improved somewhat—she can now see fuzzy shapes and distinguish colors. Despite this progress, she remains largely legally blind. We're optimistic that her vision will fully return soon."

Today, I tackled laundry with the kids in tow and quickly discovered how even the simplest tasks can turn into a major ordeal. However, I also experienced the unexpected kindness of strangers—people who were genuinely sweet without any ulterior motives. Trust me, they weren't trying to win me over, considering I was covered in kid drool and decked out in my not-so-glamorous 'wash-day' attire. Plus, given my current state, there was definitely no olfactory appeal involved!

Right now, I'm multitasking by composing a post while watching a collection of No Doubt music videos, all from the comfort of my desk in my room."

While I don't mind doing it, I sometimes wonder why I so frequently find myself repairing someone else's computer as a favor. I'm happy to be able to show care and support to people in this way, but at what point does it become taking advantage? Over the past few weeks, I've been staying up late reading and doing other activities, so I was really looking forward to going to bed early—until I realized it made more sense to get this computer out of my room and back to its owner. *laugh* No rest for the weary, right? So tonight, I found myself watching Joe Schmo 2 again."

Following that awkward lunch, shaken confidence and all, I realized I had left out a crucial detail. Just before Pat arrived, Dustin began talking about what a great guy Pat was and how he was trying to help Pat find a girlfriend. As I nodded and listened, it dawned on me that we were spending more time finding a match for Dustin's best friend than engaging in typical small talk over pink lemonade. I excused myself to the restroom, glanced in the mirror, and asked myself silently: Am I being set up with another guy? Is this what's happening now?"

In fact, I wish every person worldwide would contemplate their actions even before getting out of bed each morning. I hope they commit to thoughtful consideration throughout the day. If they're not ready to do so, I wholeheartedly wish they'd just crawl back into bed and go back to sleep indefinitely. I'm utterly fed up with foolishness. While I'm not claiming to be the smartest person in the world, I believe it's fair to criticize those severely lacking in common sense, as I'm not discussing complex matters here. Let's see if I can focus this particular rant on a few specific types of foolishness today and save the rest for another time. Sound good? Great."
8,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,blog,"There are two major issues with the scenario I described in my previous post. First, while it's true that Bush is stimulating the economy, he's doing so ineffectively. Robert Rubin mentioned on NPR's Marketplace today that Bush could have provided the same economic boost without incurring long-term debt by implementing alternative tax cuts—specifically, temporary tax cuts aimed at benefiting low and middle-income individuals. Ah, Robert Rubin. Just hearing his name is music to our ears. Now, quickly: can you name a Bush administration cabinet member on the domestic front who matches Rubin's level of influence and expertise? Still thinking? Keep pondering... Second, we can't afford to let Republicans maintain control solely during wartime since they've cleverly created an indefinite, global ""war on terrorism."

Picture this: you’re sitting in math class, bored out of your mind, and you start to ponder what processes in your brain allow you to grasp mathematical concepts. Suddenly, it hits you—you exist, you’re sitting in a math class, and you begin to question why. In that moment, you appreciate the sheer wonder of existence. Then, it dawns on you just how absurd and random this train of thought is, and it feels quite silly. Ever been there? I really dislike when that happens. You know what else gets on my nerves? Block schedules. Who thought that was a good idea? It’s clear to anyone that forcing students to endure two and a half hours in any subject is nothing short of cruel and unusual punishment."

Tonight, Andy narrowly defeated me by a few dollars and claimed victory in the game, or perhaps I allowed him to win because he's leaving in a few hours and I wanted him to feel good on his last night here. However, regardless of the narrative, it pales in comparison to this Texas-sized headache I’m currently enduring. Thankfully, I've taken some Aleve, and it’s working wonders. All I need now is some well-deserved rest and relaxation—as for the phone, it was the one that helped me imagine wrapping the cord around your neck... At the drive-in."

There’s so much to say, but I’m running low on time and energy. To start, I must express that camp was incredible, surpassing all my expectations. God has been doing amazing things in my life recently, and it’s been truly remarkable. I feel like I’ve turned over a new leaf. Now, back to the beginning. We arrived at the Twiggs' home on Friday evening and stayed there until we left for camp on Monday. During our stay, we mostly visited the fair, attended church, enjoyed a parade, shopped at Walmart, and watched movies."

I also have a dentist appointment at 9 AM, which isn't my favorite, but I'd prefer to tackle it now rather than during my first month of the surgery rotation. I'm feeling anxious, nervous, jittery, and just about any other word that captures my reluctance to return to school. This experience will be completely new for me. As a perfectionist, I take pride in excelling at everything I undertake. However, starting something new is quite a challenge. I can't stand being just another piece in the game (as I told Cassie, ""I'm going to be the only pawn on the chessboard that insists on moving like a knight""), and I'm uneasy about not knowing what to expect."
14,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,blog,"Arun Shourie discusses how the current governor of Uttar Pradesh, as early as 1996, had cautioned about the looming threat of a potential 'third Islamic state' emerging in the subcontinent. TV Rajeswar, the former head of the Intelligence Bureau and the present governor, had forecasted this serious threat in a series of articles published in The Hindustan Times in 1996. Shourie poses an important question: now that it is known that Rajeswar, not himself or Mr. Advani, authored these warnings, does this lend credibility to the concerns? Or should one conclude that because Rajeswar wrote about this issue, he is a hidden communalist and should not remain governor of Uttar Pradesh?"

However, it's great to see Tigger (now Akcron) stepping up and making an appearance to talk about various topics. :) Not much else to share; yesterday was Shakespeare on the Green. It was a lovely play, but unfortunately, I had to leave before the final curtain, which was disappointing. Hopefully, I'll be able to watch an entire Shakespeare play someday. But I digress. Akcron is right about the issues with the shower—it's terrible. Admittedly though, watching someone's expression while enduring self-inflicted torture can be pretty amusing."

Last evening, I went home and fell asleep, only waking when my mother called me around eight-thirty. When I woke up, it was completely dark, and I hadn't turned on the lights, so for a moment, I couldn't tell what time or day it was. It was just my mother's voice breaking through the darkness while I tried to grasp reality. I wonder why I'm feeling so drained... The weather is nice this morning. It was drizzling when I arrived. Though I've heard it's been raining in Calcutta for the last three days."
17,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,blog,"Last night was a disaster. I had to get rid of the sweater I was knitting, despite having completed about 14 inches. I ended up wasting around $10 worth of yarn, considering it costs $8 per skein. Unfortunately, by the time I reached the armholes, there were too many stitches, and the mohair kept tangling as I knitted, making it difficult to unravel the rows. The yarn frequently snapped. Surprisingly, I didn't even curse, which is rare for me. Instead, I just ripped out the stitches while listening to season two of Sex and the City (thanks to the library!). Eventually, I got frustrated and threw it away. On the bright side, I guess I can say I learned a lot through this sweater-making attempt."
18,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,blog,"Last night in class, we were discussing the assigned reading for the week, ""Getting Back into Place: Toward a Renewed Study of the Place-World"" by Edward S. Casey. The first chapter explores ""implacement,"" while the second focuses on ""displacement."" In the initial chapter, Casey highlights the difference that in our modern world and culture, time is viewed as the central organizing principle: we are constantly running out of time, saving time, or just in time. He argues that centering culture around place can create a more grounded community. (This is a brief overview, just in case my professor or any classmate reads this post.) So far, this book is the first reading that has truly captured my attention."

While laughter is undoubtedly delightful, one might question whether we would have ended up climbing that fire escape to drink beer in the howling wind had we not indulged in those freeze pops earlier. As we lingered in a doorway of a bar, unfortunately closed for business, we paused to peruse an office supplies catalog that had recently arrived in the mail. It was fortunate that we did. Who would have imagined that within those pages lay the deals of a lifetime? Certainly, not me.

Senate Republicans, hands up—who tuned into the 39-hour spectacle of judicial nominations last week? I know I didn't catch the whole thing, although I did check in once or twice. This drawn-out charade was orchestrated by Republicans frustrated that Democrats wouldn't simply agree to confirm four of Bush's more controversial judicial nominees. They aimed to gain political points with this extended display. It's worth noting that Democrats have already approved 168 of Bush's nominees, yet that's apparently insufficient for the power-driven Republicans, who seem to misunderstand their mandate for such theatrics."
21,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,blog,"This weekend was quite enjoyable. After a long hiatus, I indulged in some of nature's greenery, listened to a lot of Nevermore, which I realize I should have embraced much sooner, and immersed myself in reading. I managed to finish three books: Bruce Sterling's ""Heavy Weather,"" Larry Niven's ""World of Ptavvs,"" and Octavia Butler's ""Parable of the Sower."" ""Heavy Weather"" offered a captivating cyberpunk adventure set in a near-future USA ravaged by global warming and widespread anarchy. Although the story was clever, well-paced, and generally convincing, I must admit that it didn't leave me with any particularly profound impressions of the plot or characters. Both were skillfully crafted and vividly portrayed, yet it was a good book rather than a truly great one, in my opinion."
22,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,blog,"Returning from practicum left me challenged during the first week back, but it wasn't until the second week that I could finally see things more clearly. The phenomenon of post-practicum trauma, once hidden, is now becoming increasingly recognized. I was affected, yet a meeting with the course coordinator provided significant relief, allowing me to prevent someone else from enduring a similar experience at a school lacking in proper pedagogical standards. Yesterday, I encountered a fellow classmate who was also dissatisfied. She was resolved to warn the student scheduled for her previous school about the challenges he might face. I advised her to approach the administrator first, hoping we could address the issues more constructively."

Unfortunately, I've discovered that my skills at 8-ball and ping pong are lacking! Rick, affectionately known as 'the Canuck,' consistently outplays me—our building's front lobby features a ping pong table, offering endless opportunities for a 'quick match.' Last night, I entered an 8-ball tournament at the hotspot, our recreational tent equipped with a popcorn machine, multiple TVs, a jukebox, DVD rentals, a pool table, a dartboard, and, of course, the ubiquitous ping pong table. I was doing fairly well in my game until I made the mistake of scratching on the eight ball.

I wasn't a math enthusiast back then, and I still am not. I dislike math; in fact, I'm math phobic. You get the idea. As I struggled to grasp algebra, the doorbell rang. Setting my book aside, I went to answer the door, but no one was there. Wonderful. I went back to my studies and had just started to catch a faint glimmer of understanding emerging from my subconscious when the doorbell rang again. Just like that, my breakthrough vanished. I went to the door, and once again, no one was there. Exactly what a struggling math student needs—an unwelcome practical joker."

So, this week was filled with moving, unpacking, and a thorough decluttering process. I'm very grateful to my teammate Jill for her assistance.

To clarify, the article I'm working on and its potential consequences are not something I can find ease with. Perhaps it's because I lack a strong belief in it; I can't entirely grasp its essence. The tension behind it, the intense passion required to challenge it—that isn't something I'm familiar with. I grew up in a country where asking questions was unheard of. Truly, you just didn’t question authority. Doing so could get you shot or imprisoned under various security laws. I’m unaccustomed to this freedom of speech and the idea of openly questioning things.

We hiked towards the waterfalls, a journey that took approximately 30 minutes. It left us all a bit breathless, but we persevered and reached our destination. The water was incredibly cold, like ice, numbing our bodies as we dipped in. We spent less than an hour there before heading to another set of nearby falls, requiring another 30-minute trek. The effort was undoubtedly worthwhile, as the falls exuded a tranquil beauty, and the entire scene was breathtaking. It felt as though one could truly connect with nature, becoming part of its serene rhythm. Immersing myself in the frigid water was akin to communing with Mother Earth, while the crisp air and chilled water could easily lull you into a peaceful slumber."

As a blogger from outside the United States, I’ve been somewhat hesitant to wade into these discussions, especially those concerning flags. However, since I brought up the topic (though not the act of flag-burning), I feel compelled to share my thoughts. Firstly, I believe that enacting a law against flag-burning is utterly irrational. Once you start granting a symbol—any symbol—such automatic reverence and protection, you're making a small yet significant move towards totalitarianism. Symbols are inherently unstable; they do not inherently represent anything. It is how they are perceived or what they are made to represent that holds significance."

From: John Yurkanin, Chief Operating Officer  

Dear Participants,

I am writing to address concerns regarding the recent changes in ISO rules and their impact on the PX Day Ahead Auction. The emergency tariff filing by the California ISO last Friday has adversely affected our market operations. The implementation of mixed soft and hard price caps has caused significant disruption and posed unacceptable risks to our participants. This approach is unlikely to achieve the ISO’s intended goal of reducing real-time energy sales and procurement. Consequently, suppliers will continue to defer to the more lucrative price opportunities provided by the ISO.

To address this issue, the PX is currently petitioning Terry Winter of the ISO to permit immediate adjustment bids on submitted schedules at any price deemed appropriate. Your attention and support on this matter are highly appreciated.

Sincerely,

John Yurkanin

2. What volume is being sold daily? You refer to a DCQ and mention a 20% tolerance above or below the estimated quantity. Typically, a DCQ transaction does not allow for such tolerance.

I did not find anyone at EBS who seems to be knowledgeable or involved in any e-procurement issues. However, in Enron Corp, there is an initiative called iBuyit. This system is being deployed by the corporate office for e-procurement throughout the company and ENA, and it will reach EBS sometime later this year. John Gillespie is in charge of the iBuyit initiative, so he might be the right contact. I left him a voicemail but haven't received a response yet.

For the period from August 2000 to September 2000, the rate schedule results in a significantly higher commodity charge. This is because SDG&E customers are expected to receive a lump sum reimbursement from SDG&E during these months, leading them to anticipate lower electric bills. If we do not consider this lump sum reimbursement in the implicit energy component, the average from June 2000 through January 2001 is 6.2 cents, while from February 2001 through December 2001, it's 7.3 cents. The overall average implicit commodity for June 2000 through December 2001 is 6.9 cents. For deliveries beginning September 1, 2000, the average remains at 6.9 cents."

I hope you’re doing well. Regarding your inquiry, we're not in possession of an internal memo; however, we do have external law firm memoranda.

Here's a summary of last week's events: we finalized a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney, securing additional credit lines of $1 billion. These will be backed by our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company. With this, our total credit lines now amount to $4 billion, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and ensure liquidity. Our board of directors has also welcomed a new member, William Powers Jr., the Dean of the University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas."

The current order addresses only January 2001, but it indicates that further orders will be issued regarding December 2000 and setting benchmark prices through April 2001. The prices used to calculate refunds were relatively high at $273 per MWh, considering factors like gas prices, emissions costs, and an assumed heat rate exceeding 16,000. Concerning sales to California, we have at least one short-term sale completed and have been in dialogue with the California Department of Water Resources about long-term deals.

97,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"Attention Magic enthusiasts: Wizards of the Coast appears hesitant to develop a compelling digital version of the game. At its heart, Magic: The Gathering is a social experience meant to be enjoyed with friends (or friendly rivals), filled with laughter, good-natured banter, and impressive game-winning moves. Unfortunately, Wizards seems to have lost sight of this. Players who opt to compete with friends won't earn gold, and gold plays a crucial role. It’s so essential that they've instituted a daily cap—reasonable, given that gold unlocks everything in the game. However, prepare yourself for a tedious 1v1 grind against the computer or random opponents, to whom you can't even communicate. Should you decide to play for free, anticipate dedicating about four hours per day for up to a month, on your own, just to unlock the cards."

Personally, I'm not a fan of prequels, as they seem to move the story backward rather than forward—a common issue with all prequels. However, they do provide additional narrative depth. Unfortunately, the combat feels lackluster and doesn't possess the refinement that Arkham City achieved. As of this recommendation (October 26, 2013), there's a game-breaking bug that prevents a side mission from being completed (though it doesn't affect the main storyline). Some gadgets are assigned inconvenient hotkeys, requiring you to stretch across the keyboard, which might seem minor, but during combat, it could disrupt your combo."
99,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"In the 2013 release of Shadow Warrior, they've significantly improved the game. The boss battles are exhilarating, and the weapons deliver a satisfying experience—perhaps not quite on par with those in DOOM 2016, but still impressive. The enemies are balanced well, not overly tough, provided you manage elemental aspects and upgrades wisely. The upgrade system is well-adjusted, becoming intuitive once you familiarize yourself with it. The use of elemental features and limited ammunition subtly encourages you to switch between different weapons. There are numerous cool, unique weapons—in stark contrast to the random generation often seen in Borderlands—that remain effective throughout most of the game. The soundtrack is fantastic, especially the main theme, with notable contributions from Stan Bush."

My player is an outside scorer, point guard, standing at 1.71m, with maxed stats and all the necessary perks. Now, can someone explain why shooting ability is linked to a player's height? Why can't a person who is 1.74m be as proficient in shooting as someone who is 1.71m? In real life, I am 1.87m, and when I created my first player with this height, I discovered that I couldn't exceed a skill level of 89. Why is that? It feels like pure discrimination! Moreover, why doesn't the game inform me of these limitations before I create a character or even when I hit the skill cap after weeks of playing?!"
102,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"Although I can't personally recommend this game, it's not entirely bad. The gunplay is satisfactory if you can afford to buy gun parts, which leads to my main issue with this game: it's pay-to-win. If I could overlook this aspect, the game would be enjoyable because the hardsuit is a blast to use and the HRV is a brilliant concept. I'd prefer this game over any Call of Duty title any day, but its pay-to-win microtransaction structure is quite off-putting to me. If you're okay with this setup, by all means, enjoy the game. However, if you're like me and dislike pay-to-win games, it's best to pass on this one; it's not our style."
103,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"Although not without its flaws, this game has been incredibly enjoyable. The save system and potential for sudden death can be a bit frustrating. During my first playthrough, I lost my main character around the 10-hour mark of a roughly 20-hour game. I wish there had been a save point to reload at that moment. To prevent such catastrophic setbacks, I've since resorted to using a third-party mod/save tool. Additionally, the aiming reticle feels somewhat small, and the zoom is underpowered. Despite these issues, it’s been an absolute blast. Normally, I'm not a fan of zombie games, but the blend of strategy, missions, and first-person shooter/beat 'em up elements is fantastic. I've been playing as much as I can, always telling myself, ""just one more mission,"" or ""just one more supply run,"" or running off to find a safe spot before turning the game off."
104,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"This is an outstanding strategy game!

The graphics are stunning, the sound design is excellent, and the overall gameplay is truly epic. Even the in-game chat box at the main menu provides great entertainment, and I am not exaggerating. However, if you think this game is 'easy' or you're new to the strategy genre, be prepared to invest some time to master it. Don't be discouraged if you lose a lot of units at first. Just remember to plan ahead and always include anti-air and anti-tank measures in your strategy."
105,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"Initially, I had a negative bias against this game before actually playing it. I wasn't even sure if I should buy it since the concept of the portal gun and portals felt strange to me, even as a fan of science fiction. However, I quickly realized how wrong I was. The jokes and voice acting in this game are outstanding—simply amazing. It's not overly cheesy (okay, sometimes it is a bit cheesy), and each character in the story brings their own unique sense of humor. The diverse personalities of these characters are truly distinct. Additionally, the level design is exceptional. By the way, I've never played the first Portal game, but one of these days, I plan to if I can find the time. I probably wouldn't have played this one if I hadn't experienced the sequel first."

Pros:
+ Features some of the best characters 
+ Engaging story 
+ Abundance of content 
+ Customizable character (choose to be male or female)
+ Ability to form relationships with most companions (yes, fangirls, there's a love interest!)

Cons:
- Poor graphics (though I believe graphics are not crucial)
- Awkward love scenes 
- Presence of invisible walls 
- One mission felt dull, but personal preferences vary
+/- This is neutral, but note that your created protagonist doesn't have voice lines

Now, onto my thoughts. I absolutely love this game. It's probably one of the best role-playing games, or even games in general, that I've ever played. If you're an RPG fan, you probably already own this gem."
107,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"For those in their thirties, particularly in the UK, this is a nostalgic journey back to the days of watching the ever-annoying Timmy Mallett just for that brief, five-minute Transformers cartoon segment. The original voice actors for characters like Optimus, Megatron, Bumblebee, and others have returned, and they are immediately recognizable. The iconic cartoon transformation sound remains intact. Graphically, the cel-shaded style is flawlessly executed, capturing the essence of Generation One perfectly. Beyond that, it's genuinely an enjoyable game. The combat mechanics are exceptionally well designed. Transforming during battles is often essential and is seamlessly integrated into combos, distinguishing it from High Moon's excellent War for and Fall of Cybertron games. Another notable difference is the strong emphasis on melee combat, although some enemies, like Seekers, necessitate a switch to a ranged blaster."
108,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"I downloaded the game and played it for a short time, but it didn’t stand out. I spent more time attempting to log in than actually playing. There's a bug that claims the terms of service have been updated, but when you click 'accept,' the message just reappears. You have to restart the client to resolve this issue. That alone isn't too bad, but why do I need to link my Steam and Gface accounts? They claim it's necessary for DLC, yet this seems unnecessary. Moreover, it's irreversible, so now a company I don't care about has access to my Steam information. The game itself is just average. It clearly imitates Call of Duty, but they've somehow managed to make the gunplay even worse. How is that even possible?"
109,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"Running smoothly at 4k resolution and 60fps on a GTX 970, this game offers dual audio options and comes with Neptune gear—what's not to love? It's an excellent port and a fantastic entry point for newcomers to the series. Just be aware that there is a lot of dialogue, most of which you can skip. As usual, I recommend using a gamepad, but I personally had no issues using a keyboard and mouse setup, with both options being fully customizable. The pricing seems fair, and I would have been satisfied with the purchase. More than half of the DLC is included for free, providing plenty of content to explore. I would recommend this game to all fans of JRPGs, anime, and visual novels, as long as you don't mind lengthy pauses between the action. Cheers.

I especially enjoyed the 'dual play' segments, where you can play as Batman alongside another character. The option to use a controller for most parts of the game, while switching to a mouse and keyboard for the tank combat segments, was greatly appreciated. Navigating your Batmobile around the free-roam city, particularly during chases with the APC commanders, becomes quite enjoyable once you master using the brakes for skidding around corners.

Here's what stood out to me: - There's no SLI support, which is frustrating. I had to pause playing until I could upgrade my GPU because it performed poorly on my old dual GPU GTX 590.

It's in a league of its own and ought to be appreciated as such. I've lost count of how many times I hear new players complain about getting killed quickly. Heaven forbid you get shot in the face and die instantly—such things do happen in reality.

The story and world-building have captured my interest, and the puzzles offer genuine enjoyment. However, the standout feature of this game is undeniably its comedy. Anyone familiar with RPGs, from their inception to now, will appreciate the clever jokes, parodies, and references. Even newcomers to RPGs will find themselves entertained by its wit. For those who have experienced Final Fantasy 7 or X, this game is a must-play.

The description seemed perfectly suited to my interests, yet the execution left me unimpressed. Despite my love for puzzle and exploration games, I found this one entirely unintuitive. Even after searching for guidance on how to progress, I simply didn't find the gameplay enjoyable. Additionally, the game seems to lack a pause button, or if it does have one, it's completely elusive to me. Given that many sequences in the game are timed, this feels like a significant oversight. Furthermore, it seems more like a collection of cutscenes than an actual game, leaving me often twiddling my thumbs."

My stomach was in knots the entire time, but I persevered for Uncle Fred! If you guys released a DLC or a sequel, I'd be the first in line to purchase it and recommend it to everyone I know.

What I appreciate about this game is that 2K Games ventured into new territory with innovative mechanics, such as the affinity system and the orbital layer. However, I found that these additions could sometimes make the game overwhelming. One area for improvement could be the incorporation of fresh artwork, particularly in the environments encountered during interactions with other leaders."

In the brief time I've played it, I've realized that I'd be hooked if not for these two critical issues. First, the absence of Australian servers results in a red bar that significantly hampers gameplay and introduces unbearable lag. Even in offline training mode, I experienced stuttering and lag, which is baffling. Combined with the poor ping, it completely detracts from the gaming experience. Secondly, there are rampant graphical artifacts affecting everything from menus and backgrounds to training and in-game content. This issue is unprecedented with my current graphics card, and although I suspected it might be due to my overclocking, resetting the GPU to stock settings had no effect."
120,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"Late last night, I completed this. While the story itself isn't particularly deep or captivating, the storytelling is what truly sets this game apart. The atmosphere is thoroughly immersive, and the numerous collectibles greatly enhance the narrative. I gained a lot of insight into the world of Batman, so it was somewhat disappointing that the game featured so few bosses. However, there are plenty of opportunities in future games to address this. The combat strikes a good balance in terms of difficulty, though it leans towards being easy. Leveling up Batman wasn't particularly rewarding; it's the gadgets you upgrade and acquire during the campaign that introduce exciting new gameplay mechanics. Unlocking previously inaccessible areas delivers a satisfying sense of progress."

Never before have I felt so beautifully melancholic and fulfilled by a fictional narrative. This masterpiece, in my view, represents the apex of storytelling, paired with a soundtrack that is both exquisitely charming and perfectly complementary. Yes, the controls can be a bit tricky, and the gameplay may not be its strongest aspect, but the narrative is so compelling that it didn't bother me in the slightest. Moreover, the humor in the game is exceptional and seamlessly blends with the story's dignified essence. And let's not forget—the Doctor Who references are abundant!"

The game's art style and music are outstanding, with vibrant visuals that challenge the notion that the apocalypse must be dreary. Most notably, the game includes narration that responds to your actions as the player.

Furthermore, the game used to provide unlimited gun slots and offered five loadouts. You would expect that a game boasting ""bajillions of guns"" would offer more than just 6 weapon slots and 3 loadouts before requiring additional purchases. At one point, I had amassed about three pages of guns and was brimming with new ideas for more, as I personally found that aspect the most enjoyable."

It's not uncommon for products to receive glowing reviews that fail to live up to expectations, but in this instance, the accolades truly capture the enjoyment of this clever little game. Combining elements of a classic 2D platformer with a MOBA, it pulls off the blend with finesse. Surprisingly, I found myself liking characters I typically wouldn't favor in other MOBA games. While I anticipated sticking to my usual preferences, I decided to try a melee tank and was thrilled with the results, leading me to explore more characters as they became available through gameplay. The art style and interface possess a quirky charm, and as a result, I've adopted one of the characters as my avatar and use a wallpaper I created from a card set for the game."

I eagerly anticipate each combat encounter, and the developers have optimized the combat mechanics brilliantly. Initially, I had reservations about the naval combat system, but it's incredibly satisfying to decimate multiple fleets at once! The only way to be defeated in this game is by failing to retreat. If the battle seems overwhelming, it's best to retreat, regroup, and launch a counterattack. Kudos to the developers for delivering an amazing experience!"

While fans of the original saga might feel disappointed with the transformation of their cherished character, these changes are undoubtedly beneficial, as demonstrated by the new game developed by Ninja Theory. ""DMC"" serves as an ideal entry point for newcomers to the series, exploring the origins of a once arrogant and cynical Dante, and illustrating his evolution from cynicism to selflessness. The game presents a well-defined narrative arc for this revamped Dante, transforming him into a captivating character. The storyline follows Dante as he enters the corrupt world he had previously chosen to ignore."

Its story is utterly enchanting, filled with meticulous detail, and it's a delightful mix of joy, cheesy jokes, mischievous dogs, and hidden surprises. It strikes a perfect balance, being serious when necessary but never shying away from moments of humor. The character design is impeccable, showcasing a variety of personalities and secrets. What sets it apart from other RPGs is its unique approach—you don't have to kill anyone, a rare concept in the genre. Drawing significant inspiration from Earthbound, one of the finest RPGs I've encountered, it's clear that this game promises greatness. The soundtrack is also outstanding; it's the best I've heard in a long time."

Personally, the game left no impact on me. Half of its storyline depends heavily on shock value, which neither surprised nor emotionally affected me. Perhaps I'm desensitized, or maybe it wasn't complex enough to provoke a reaction. The other half aims to depict (quite literally) a person's mental decline, addressing themes of obsession, hallucination, depression, and more. In concept, it's an intriguing idea. However, it only took me 10 minutes to finish, even as I carefully absorbed every detail."

It's a fantastic way to challenge your mind while still being enjoyable. Although it's not heavy on story, Portal paved the way for one of the most acclaimed games of 2011. I still find myself playing it and conquering it when I'm feeling bored, relishing the opportunity to revisit what laid the foundation for a legend and has since become a legend itself. 

Gameplay-wise, Portal is straightforward, at least in terms of explanation. You manipulate portals to your advantage and use buttons to activate different parts of the puzzle. There are two types of buttons in the game: one you can press and one that requires a cube to be placed on it."

I strive to remain objective, despite the sheer fun of transforming into a dragon to support your troops by attacking, commanding unit production, and directing forces all at once.

However, the gameplay lacks smoothness, the levels are unimaginative, and the overall experience feels like a surreal horror show.

The game begins by asking you to choose between being a Republican or a Democrat, with no option for independents or third parties.

The recoil and ballistics are depicted with realism, as even a single hit to the chest, neck, or head with a rifle-caliber bullet is almost always lethal, unless it's just a graze. Bullets drop over distances, necessitating short, controlled bursts to stay on target. There's no limitless ammunition; if you frequently reload halfway through your magazine, you'll end up with a pouch filled with partially full magazines. You can't sprint indefinitely; prolonged running will affect your aim as you struggle to catch your breath. To stabilize your aim, rest your weapon on your elbows when prone or on a window sill. Standing results in compromised accuracy."

I thoroughly enjoyed the game; it was challenging in the early stages but incredibly rewarding when you mastered it. Regarding XCOM 2, I absolutely love it. The game runs smoothly for me on medium settings, and I'm using a GTX 560 with 2GB of VRAM. Initially, the game automatically set itself to high, which caused it to run a bit sluggishly, but it was far from unplayable. Once I adjusted it to medium, everything ran smoothly. I'm uncertain whether I'm simply fortunate with how games perform on my setup, but it seems like most negative reviews come from individuals who seem rather demanding."

Listen, this game is incredibly fun. Despite the downsides mentioned, there's a good amount of variety and strategic depth. The game starts off with a fast pace and continues to pick up momentum.

These geometries can disrupt the axial and equatorial symmetry found in the Kerr metric, resulting in a more complex multipolar structure. This complexity serves as a key to phenomenologically constrain fuzzball models. Our numerical findings suggest that the multipole moments in these cases are generally greater (in absolute terms) than those associated with a Kerr black hole of identical mass and spin.

This suppression, with its uncertain shape and magnitude, presents a significant source of uncertainties for upcoming cosmological weak lensing surveys like Euclid and LSST. In this first paper of a two-part series, we utilize simulations to create a Euclid-like tomographic mock dataset for the cosmic shear power spectrum and its associated covariance matrix. Both are adjusted for baryonic effects, based on the baryonification method by Schneider et al. (2019). Furthermore, we develop an emulator that provides rapid predictions of baryonic power suppression, enabling us to conduct a likelihood inference analysis within a standard ΛCDM cosmology, incorporating both cosmological and astrophysical parameters."
213,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"Spontaneous conversations in real-world scenarios, particularly those captured in child-centered recordings, have proven to be some of the most difficult audio files to process. Despite these challenges, developing speech processing models that can handle a broad range of conditions is crucial for language acquisition research. Such models are essential for researchers interested in analyzing the quantity and quality of speech that children hear and produce, as well as for early diagnosis and assessing the effects of remediation. In this paper, we introduce our method for creating an open-source neural network designed to classify audio segments. These segments include vocalizations made by the child wearing the recording device, other children's vocalizations, adult male speech, and adult female speech. To achieve this, we compiled diverse child-centered corpora totaling 260 hours of recordings across 10 different languages."

By acknowledging an actual, yet unknown, population structure, clustering can be approached through standard inferential methodologies. Here, the notion of an ideal population cluster is characterized by the partition dictated by the true density function. This approach, particularly its nonparametric form known as modal clustering, aligns the groups with the domains of attraction around the density modes. Practically, it requires a nonparametric density estimate, and skillful smoothing is vital, as it influences the shape of the density and potentially the modal structure, to accurately determine the final partition. In our study, we tackle the challenge of density estimation for modal clustering from an asymptotic standpoint."
215,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"The tails of diboson production at the LHC are crucial for detecting the interference between the Standard Model and higher-dimension operators that represent the influence of new, heavy physics. However, helicity selection rules for the diboson scattering amplitudes introduce a barrier to the straightforward interference contributions from dimension-six operators, leading to the cancellation of the leading contribution to the total diboson rate correction. In this scenario, a precise measurement of the azimuthal decay angles effectively ""revives"" the interference, restoring sensitivity to these ""non-interfering"" operators. In our detailed exploration of these signatures, we discover that the Effective Field Theory (EFT) uncertainties tied to higher-dimensional operators are uniquely mitigated by the development of an asymmetry variable, which is exclusively produced by these non-interfering operators. As a result, the effects of higher-dimensional, interfering operators are demoted to the same level as statistical errors in this observable."

Traditionally, academic statistics has been skeptical of data analyses aimed at drawing causal conclusions. However, the advent of the term ""data science"" presents a historic opportunity to redefine data analysis, enabling it to naturally integrate causal inference from observational data. Like others have previously, we categorize the scientific contributions of data science into three major task classes: description, prediction, and counterfactual prediction (which encompasses causal inference). Clearly defining these data science tasks is essential for discussing the data, assumptions, and analytical methods needed to successfully complete each task. We contend that the often overlooked role of subject-matter expert knowledge in data analysis is a significant source of widespread misconceptions about data science."
217,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"The Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) asserts that superextremal particles must exist within any coherent quantum theory of gravity. It is traditionally understood that these particles play a crucial role in ensuring that extremal black holes are either unstable or at best marginally stable. However, the implications of their absence are not well understood. This document demonstrates that, within a typical Einstein quantum theory of gravity in AdS, the exact stability of extremal black branes conflicts with established quantum information theorems concerning entanglement entropy. To resolve this contradiction, a nonperturbative version of the WGC is proposed, aligning with the conventional assertion at weak coupling. This argument is broad and does not depend on supersymmetry or any specific UV completion; it only presumes the legitimacy of Einsteinian gravity, effective field theory, and holography."
218,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"One of the key unresolved challenges in condensed matter physics is understanding how strongly correlated two-dimensional (2D) systems can lead to unconventional superconductivity with high critical temperatures. Ultracold 2D Fermi gases have emerged as pristine and controllable model systems to explore the interaction between strong correlations and reduced dimensionality. However, direct evidence of superfluidity in these systems has been lacking. In this study, we demonstrate superfluidity within an ultracold 2D Fermi gas by moving a periodic potential through the system and observing the absence of dissipation below a critical velocity, denoted as \(v_{\rm c}\). We measure \(v_{\rm c}\) as a function of interaction strength and identify a peak in the crossover regime between bosonic and fermionic superfluidity. Our findings establish ultracold Fermi gases as a potent tool for investigating the effects of reduced dimensionality on strongly correlated superfluids."
219,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) serve as essential mathematical models across numerous fields, including climatology, bioinformatics, and chemical engineering, due to their intuitive approach to modeling complex phenomena. Despite their widespread application, ODEs often lack analytic solutions, posing challenges in parameter estimation from data, particularly in models with numerous variables and parameters. This paper introduces a Bayesian algorithm for estimating ODE parameters, which is both fast and accurate, even for models with a large number of parameters. The proposed method approximates an ODE model using a state-space model derived from the equations of a numerical solver. This approach facilitates rapid estimation by eliminating the need to compute an entire numerical solution within the likelihood. The posterior distribution is obtained through a variational Bayes method, specifically employing the approximate Riemannian conjugate gradient method as detailed by Honkela et al."

Our findings reveal that both the differential conductance and the induced pairing amplitudes are significantly influenced by the angle between the direction of the junction in real space and the axis separating the Weyl nodes in momentum space. We also highlight the impact of a chiral chemical potential, which refers to the electron population imbalance between Weyl nodes of opposite chirality, on the junction's transport features. Interestingly, we detect a net spin polarization of Cooper pairs generated via Andreev reflection within the two Weyl semimetal regions. This spin polarization is opposite in the two regions and is highly sensitive to variations in chirality imbalance and excitation energy."

This method is particularly noteworthy for its ability to control the voltage drop across high-voltage insulators, thereby enhancing the maximum operational voltage that can be applied without causing surface flashover. A potential issue in utilizing this technique is the stability of the implantation-induced conductivity over time, primarily if the implanted metal is prone to oxidation. In our study, we investigate the long-term stability of surface conductivity in titanium-implanted alumina. Our findings reveal that while there is an initial reduction in conductivity of up to 40% within the first few weeks post-implantation, the rate of decrease markedly slows, with only about a 10% reduction observed over the subsequent year."

The corresponding charge aligns with the skyrmion charge for any smooth configuration. Additionally, there are singular configurations identifiable as \( n_f=1 \) baryons, which carry a charge under this new symmetry. In this framework, vector mesons serve as Chern-Simons vector fields residing on the quantum Hall droplet that constitutes the \( n_f=1 \) baryon. We propose that this current accurately represents the baryon current at low energies, offering a unified perspective on the two baryon types and facilitating their seamless transformation into one another. Furthermore, Chern-Simons dualities on the droplet can be interpreted as a consequence of a Seiberg-like duality between gluons and vector mesons."

Our theoretical study explores how these combined effects influence the transport properties of superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator/superconductor junctions. Transverse momentum-dependent skew tunneling of Cooper pairs through the spin-active ferromagnetic insulator interface results in significant transverse Hall supercurrents, termed anomalous Josephson Hall effect currents. We extend the Furusaki-Tsukada formula, originally developed to measure conventional (tunneling) Josephson current flows, to assess the transverse current components. We demonstrate that their amplitudes can be significantly adjusted by altering spin-orbit coupling strengths or the superconducting phase difference across the junction. As a distinct spectroscopic signature of these Josephson junctions, well-defined subgap bound states emerge around the interface."

(J. of Turbul., 2020), which highlight the critical role of dipoles in the dynamics of decaying two-dimensional turbulence, alongside individual vortex cores, it is observed that the flow's kinetic energy is predominantly carried by elongated streams formed by linked dipoles. Vortices divide into two groups: smaller, fast-moving cores and larger, slow-moving ones. The larger cores can be considered as 'frozen' within a gradually evolving 'crystal.' The kinematics of these two groups differ significantly, with only the smaller cores demonstrating self-similar behavior. The larger group drives the primary kinetic energy of the flow, forming the dipoles and streams. The mechanisms for the development of this slower component are explored further."

A key measure in this framework is the quantum hitting time, which determines the time needed for a quantum walk to locate a target vertex with high probability. In this article, we establish enhanced upper bounds for the quantum hitting time, applicable to numerous quantum algorithms based on continuous-time quantum walks. Specifically, our methods enhance the solution to the glued-trees problem by reducing the upper bound on hitting time from $o(n^5)$ to $o(n^2\log n)$—a significant polynomial reduction. Additionally, our techniques achieve an exponential improvement in precision dependence for the continuous-time quantum walk algorithm to identify a marked node within any ergodic, reversible Markov chain, as demonstrated by Chakraborty et al."

Previously, dry EMRIs, also known as ""loss-cone"" EMRIs, were considered the primary EMRI sources for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. These are mainly generated by multi-body interactions and gravitational capture in nuclear star clusters. In this letter, we explore an alternative formation pathway for EMRIs: the formation of wet EMRIs, facilitated by the accretion flow around accreting massive black holes (MBHs) in galactic centers. In this scenario, the accretion disk captures stellar-mass black holes initially on inclined orbits, prompting them to migrate toward the MBH. This process significantly enhances the EMRI formation rate in such galaxies by several orders of magnitude."

This challenge is categorized as the new user cold-start problem, which is critical for a company's growth and even its survival. Current solutions for the user cold-start recommendation often demand extra efforts from users, like conducting an interview process, or rely on supplementary data, such as user demographics, locations, or social relationships, as noted in [10]. However, users may be reluctant to participate in interviews, and additional information about cold-start users is generally not accessible."

It has found successful applications in wireless communications, despite the current radio systems being well-understood, with optimal algorithms available for many tasks. Although some improvements have been achieved by focusing on individual components of a receiver, a more effective strategy is to learn the entire receiver system collectively. This approach, however, often leads to a complex nonlinear problem, making the optimal solution difficult to implement. In response, we have developed a deep fully convolutional neural network, named deeprx, which manages the entire receiver process—from processing the frequency domain signal stream to producing uncoded bits—in a manner compliant with 5G standards. To enhance the accuracy of channel estimation, we meticulously design the input for the convolutional neural network, incorporating both data and pilot symbols."
229,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"Mutation-based fuzzing generally starts with a set of non-crashing seed inputs, known as a corpus, which serves as a basis for generating new inputs through mutation. Often, a corpus consists of thousands of similar inputs, which can limit diversity and result in inefficient fuzzing due to repetitive mutations from all available seeds. To combat this issue, fuzzers are equipped with distillation tools, such as afl-cmin, designed to pinpoint the smallest subset of seeds that can trigger the same range of instrumentation data points as the entire corpus. It is widely accepted that reducing the number and total size of these seeds enhances fuzzing efficiency, a hypothesis we systematically examine. We present the findings from over 34 CPU-years of fuzzing utilizing five different distillation techniques to assess their effectiveness in uncovering bugs in real-world software."

We categorize the agents into distinct groups, within which agents share similar (isomorphic) state transition structures. Consequently, they can be reconfigured into a unified template. Utilizing this template, we develop a scalable supervisor designed for partial observation scenarios. Notably, the state size and computational cost of this supervisor remain constant, regardless of the number of agents in the system. The scalable supervisor under partial observation is robust, eliminating the need for recalibration as agents are added or removed. We extend our prior work to address partial observation by introducing sufficient conditions that ensure both safety and maximal permissiveness of the scalable least restrictive supervisor at the template level. An example is included to demonstrate the proposed method for scalable supervisory synthesis."

Notably, it introduces the use of a temporal window—other than the typical rectangular form—before the spectral estimation phase, marking a first in ENF analysis. Krylov matrices facilitate rapid matrix inversions for efficient implementation.

In our study, we explored the fluorescence anomalous saturating effect associated with nitrogen vacancy defects in diamond. When subjected to high-power laser excitation, a reduction in fluorescence was observed, which heightened the nonlinearity of the fluorescence emission and altered the spatial frequency distribution of the fluorescence image. To extract high spatial frequency information, we implemented a differential excitation protocol. By modulating the power of the excitation laser, we were able to enhance the spatial resolution of imaging by approximately 1.6 times compared to traditional confocal microscopy. Owing to the simplicity of both the experimental setup and data processing, we anticipate that this method can be employed to enhance the spatial resolution in applications such as sensing and biological labeling using defects in solids."
234,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"When random effects correlate with sample design variables, using individual survey weights—which are designed to be inversely proportional to the unit survey inclusion probabilities—no longer yields asymptotically unbiased inference. To address this, we propose a weight-exponentiated model for the random effects distribution that successfully produces unbiased inference for deriving hyperparameters of the random effects. Our approach is compared to frequentist methods utilizing numerical integration, highlighting that only the Bayesian method achieves unbiased estimation relative to the sampling design distribution, while also maintaining consistency with the population-generating distribution. Through simulations and a real-world data example from a survey of business establishments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across various modeling frameworks and sampling designs. This work culminates recent development efforts that integrate traditional survey estimation techniques with the Bayesian modeling paradigm, thereby connecting these two rich yet distinct fields."

These primary processes shift in dominance across a temperature range of approximately fifty degrees. Through dielectric spectroscopy, researchers were able to identify two distinct orientational relaxation processes: the first resulting from the rotation of the side mesogenic groups, and the second linked to the movement of the main chain segments."
237,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"Deep hashing techniques have demonstrated remarkable retrieval efficiency and accuracy in large-scale image retrieval systems. The focus of deep hashing methods has always been on optimizing discrete hash codes. These methods typically employ an activation function—such as $\operatorname{sigmoid}(\cdot)$ or $\operatorname{tanh}(\cdot)$—and aim to minimize a quantization loss to approximate discrete values. However, this approach can lead to an increasing number of hash bits getting stuck in the incorrect saturation zones of the activation functions, from which they cannot escape. We refer to this issue as the ""dead bits problem"" (dbp). Moreover, the traditional quantization loss can exacerbate dbp. In this paper, we introduce a straightforward yet effective solution: a gradient amplifier that operates before the activation functions to mitigate dbp."
238,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"We explore the phenomenology of a hypercharge-zero SU(2) triplet scalar, which is hypothesized to exist due to the two-step electroweak symmetry-breaking process. Our study considers two scenarios: first, where these triplets are stable and contribute to the dark matter density, and second, where they decay through mixing with the Standard Model Higgs boson. In the case of stable triplets, constraints arise from disappearing charged track searches at the LHC and direct detection dark matter experiments. For unstable triplets, existing multilepton collider search results provide limitations. We conclude that a two-step electroweak phase transition featuring a stable triplet with a negative quadratic term is ruled out by direct detection efforts, whereas an unstable triplet with a mass under 230 GeV is excluded with 95% confidence."
239,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"This paper demonstrates that the eccentric debris rings observed around the stars Fomalhaut and HD 202628 are surprisingly narrower than what is anticipated by the conventional eccentric planet perturbation model, often known as ""pericenter glow."" According to this traditional theory, a belt of planetesimals, initially circular and narrow with a semi-major axis $a$, attains an eccentricity $e_f$ following the dispersion of the gas disc due to secular perturbations from an eccentric planet. This results in a belt with a width of $2ae_f$. A slight alteration to this scenario suggests that narrower belts may develop if the planetesimals are initially eccentric, a condition possibly arising from previous planet-induced perturbations during the gas-rich protoplanetary disc phase. Alternatively, this initial eccentricity might be attributed to instabilities that increase the disc's eccentricity, eliminating the necessity for any planetary influence."

In this study, we present measurements of many-body modes in 1D gated wires using a tunneling spectroscopy technique. We identify two distinct Fermi seas at high energies, corresponding to spin and charge excitations, along with the emergence of three additional 1D 'replica' modes that become more pronounced as the wire length decreases.

We provide a theoretical demonstration that this effect arises when users click predominantly on top-ranked items and exhibit diverse preferences toward different item categories.

I'm interested in the people behind my meal choices and understanding the impact I have on them, as well as how they affect me. I want to know why they fish and how they depend on the ocean's resources for their livelihood. Grasping these factors allows us to transform our view of seafood from a mere commodity into a means to rejuvenate our ecosystem, and it gives us the chance to appreciate the seafood we are privileged to enjoy. What should we call this? I believe it's restorative seafood. While sustainability focuses on the capacity to endure and maintain, restorative embodies the ability to renew and advance."

The cold-hearted miser haunted by the ghost of Christmas past. More than a century after his death, these vivid characters from Charles Dickens' work still resonate. His writing was so impactful that it inspired its own adjective. But what exactly makes Dickens' writing so exceptional? His fiction is rich with suspense, filled with brooding settings, unexpected plot twists, and intriguing mysteries. These elements kept his readers eagerly awaiting the next installment. Originally, his stories were serialized, published a few chapters at a time in affordable literary journals, and only later compiled into books."

We admired these incredible athletes, marveled at the stunning goals, and appreciated the thrilling and fair play in the matches. Simultaneously, off the field, these women were advocating for equal pay—and, in some countries, for any compensation at all—for their participation in the sport. Driven by our growing fascination, we aimed to watch the matches live and concluded that one of the Spanish-speaking networks in the US offered the best coverage. A few games into the tournament, a friend remarked, ""Why does it seem like all the advertisements are for makeup, household cleaning products, and diets?"

Insisting on your innocence could likely lead to a guilty verdict and execution. However, if you falsely confess, apologize, and implicate others, you could secure your freedom. This was the grim dilemma faced by those accused of witchcraft in Salem, Massachusetts, between February 1692 and May 1693. They became victims of paranoia about the supernatural, misguided religious zeal, and a justice system that valued repentance over truth. The village of Salem was established in 1626 by Puritans, a group of English Protestants. Life in Salem was characterized by strictness and isolation, with frequent conflicts involving Native American neighbors and groups of French settlers."

Sadly, the demand far outweighs the available supply of donor organs. Imagine if, instead of waiting, we could engineer new, customized organs from scratch. This is the concept behind bioprinting, a rapidly developing field within regenerative medicine. Although we have not yet mastered the printing of complex organs, we are capable of creating simpler structures like blood vessels and channels used for nutrient and waste exchange. Bioprinting is akin to 3D printing, a technique that builds three-dimensional objects layer by layer."

Today, I aim to discuss a powerful phenomenon that's making waves and transforming our world—something we call ""people power."" To begin, let me share an anecdote, or for those who appreciate Monty Python, a sketch reminiscent of their style. Imagine this: it's December 15, 2010. Someone proposes a wager to you: peek into a crystal ball and witness the future—perfectly accurate—and then share it with the world. Intrigued, you accept the challenge, despite the old adage about curiosity. An hour later, you find yourself in the studio of a national television station, featured on a prime talk show, recounting your tale."

Hailed as the voice of his generation, he's producing iconic songs at an extraordinary pace. However, there's a small group of critics who accuse him of plagiarizing others' music. Fast forward to 2004, Brian Burton, known as Danger Mouse, merges The Beatles' ""White Album"" with Jay-Z's ""The Black Album,"" creating ""The Grey Album."" This new work quickly becomes an online sensation, prompting The Beatles' record label to issue numerous cease-and-desist letters, citing ""unfair competition and dilution of our valuable property."" Notably, ""The Grey Album"" is a remix."

Yet, you're here, representing various parts of the world. If you visualize a map of your country, you'll likely notice that in every nation, there are specific areas labeled as places ""where quality teachers won't go."" Ironically, these are often the very areas where issues tend to arise. Thus, we face a paradox: skilled educators avoid the regions where they are most needed. In 1999, I embarked on an experiment in New Delhi to tackle this challenge with a straightforward approach."

I always begin my poetry workshops by asking students these questions because poetry can sometimes appear like an antiquated art form associated with old white men, seemingly born into old age, reminiscent of Benjamin Button. I pose these questions to my students and then reveal my answers in the form of three sentences: I am the daughter of Black writers, who descended from freedom fighters that broke their chains and transformed the world. They inspire me. I repeat these words as a mantra before every poetry performance. In fact, just a moment ago, I was over there in the corner, reciting them and making faces."

I love sharing this part of my life because people are always curious about who these so-called street performers are beyond the act. (Laughs) So, here I am. I would paint myself white, stand on a box, and place a hat or can at my feet. When someone dropped in money, I would give them a flower and engage in some intense eye contact.

This small metallic orb, less than two feet in diameter, ignited a space race between the United States and the Soviet Union that endured for eighteen years and profoundly transformed our world. However, Sputnik was not the first human-made object to reach space—that distinction belongs to the V-2 rocket, which Germany employed in missile attacks against Allied cities during the closing years of World War II. Although the V-2 wasn't particularly effective, by the war's end, both the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. had seized the technology and the engineers behind it, utilizing them for their own burgeoning aerospace projects."

But why is this the case? At this very moment, over 800 million women across the globe are experiencing their period. It's a fundamental part of human existence, yet it remains an ""embarrassing"" topic to discuss openly. From both my own experience and those of the women around me, I can attest to how tiring it is. It's exhausting to discreetly retrieve a pad hidden in a brown paper bag, slipping it into your pocket during class, and rushing to the restroom as inconspicuously as possible. It's equally draining to endure lessons and meetings, outwardly appearing fine while internally battling intense period cramps."

This vast forest extends across northern Canada, including Labrador, where the George River Caribou Herd resides—the largest remaining wild caribou herd in the world, with approximately 400,000 animals. Unfortunately, during my visit, I was unable to spot any caribou, though the antlers bear testament to their presence. Throughout the boreal region, we are fortunate to have an incredible abundance of wetlands. Globally, wetlands are among the most threatened ecosystems, yet they are vital for cleaning air and water, sequestering significant amounts of greenhouse gases, and providing a home to a wide array of species."

Among them, Deminan stood out; his skin bore painful scabs, and he was perplexed as to why he alone suffered this unusual misfortune. One day, while the supreme spirit, Yaya, tended to his gardens, Deminan and his brothers furtively entered Yaya’s home.

This journey started when my family relocated from southern Canada to the northern end of Baffin Island, near Greenland. We settled in a small Inuit community consisting of only 200 people, where ours was one of just three non-Inuit families. In this remote village, we lived without the conveniences of television, computers, or even a radio. We didn't have a telephone either. I spent all my time outdoors with the Inuit, learning and playing. The snow and ice became my playground, and the Inuit were my mentors. This unique experience sparked my lifelong fascination with the polar world."

I have no control over who comes to us or how long they remain. We receive individuals for whom every other support system has failed, those who have slipped through all existing social safety nets. These systems can't manage them, so it falls to us. Our role is to contain and control them. Over the years, as a prison system, as a nation, and as a society, we've become very proficient at this, but it is not something to take pride in. Today, we incarcerate more people per capita than any other country in the world. Disturbingly, there are more Black men in prison today than were enslaved in 1850."

The objective: to escort and successfully land a probe on a comet. To appreciate the significance of this quest, it's crucial to delve into the origins of our solar system. Around four and a half billion years ago, a cloud of gas and dust existed. At the heart of this cloud, our Sun was born and ignited. Simultaneously, what we now recognize as planets, comets, and asteroids also began to form. The prevailing theory suggests that as Earth cooled after its initial formation, it was heavily bombarded by comets. These impacts likely delivered not only water but also complex organic materials to our planet, potentially sparking the emergence of life."

President Theodore Roosevelt spent his nights amidst the majestic sequoia trees, camped through a snowstorm, and engaged in lengthy discussions by the campfire with his host and guide, the renowned conservationist John Muir. While Roosevelt was well known for his love of the outdoors, Muir had extended the invitation for deeper reasons: Yosemite was under threat. Although the area had been designated as protected land in 1864, by 1903, it still faced the risk of overdevelopment. This was part of a long-standing conflict over the preservation and public use of land—two objectives that proved challenging to achieve. The struggle for Yosemite's protection took root with the 1849 Gold Rush, as miners flocked westward in pursuit of gold in the Sierra Nevada foothills."

As a novice journalist, I wanted to approach it creatively to ensure it had maximum impact, especially since this corruption was an open secret yet continued unchecked. I decided to go undercover and pose as a vendor, allowing me to capture indisputable evidence of the wrongdoing. The results were outstanding and had a significant impact.

If offered the chance to embrace such an existence, would you take it? This intriguing question was introduced by philosopher Robert Nozick through his thought experiment known as the Experience Machine. The experiment prompts us to consider a world where scientists have invented a machine that simulates real life, offering only pleasurable experiences without any pain. The catch is that you must leave reality behind permanently, yet you'd barely notice the difference.

288,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,speech,"Where does all the carbon we emit end up? Carbon operates within a natural cycle and is found in all living organisms, the soil, the oceans, the atmosphere, and even within rocks deep underground. When plants and other living organisms die, a significant portion of their stored carbon returns to the atmosphere until new plants grow to absorb it again. However, over millions of years, some of this carbon from ancient trees and marine life transforms into rock, while some become fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas. Natural occurrences like volcanic eruptions release some of the carbon held within rock. Human activities, notably the burning of fossil fuels, also contribute to the release of this ancient carbon. Today, humans discharge about 60 times more carbon annually than all the volcanoes on Earth combined."

Interestingly, one of the most significant distinctions between natural and human-made technologies is their robustness. Robust systems maintain stability in intricate and unfamiliar environments. Astonishingly, cockroaches can self-stabilize while traversing uneven terrain. When equipped with a jet pack or subjected to disturbances like an earthquake, their finely tuned legs enable them to stabilize without engaging their brain. They can navigate complex terrains, such as grass, effortlessly and without losing balance. We've identified a new behavior: due to their shape, they naturally roll to their side to navigate through an artificial patch of grass. Robust systems can accomplish multiple tasks using the same framework. This is a novel behavior we've uncovered."

This story rivals, in its own unique fashion, the accomplishments of Microsoft or Google. The industry I'm referring to has navigated the recent recession with remarkable stability: organized crime. While organized crime is by no means a new phenomenon—something you would wisely acknowledge—it has undergone remarkable expansion over the last 20 years, now constituting about 15 percent of the world's GDP.

They'll say emotions are bewilderingly complex and admit they have no idea how they function. On the other hand, they'll explain that they find thinking quite simple—they see it merely as a form of logical reasoning. However, this perception misses the truly difficult aspects.

However, what transformed my journey wasn't the punishment I endured as a teenager in an adult prison or the severity of our legal system. It was the learning environment of a classroom that introduced me to possibilities I had never considered attainable for myself or the justice system as a whole.

There was even a recent story suggesting that scientists contemplated substituting rats in their experiments with politicians.
