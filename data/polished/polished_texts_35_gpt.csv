1,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Another week just flew by. I drove past the new house yesterday, and the front window was covered in boxes. We may get the keys at closing; I am so excited. If all goes well this week, we'll be set for closing a week from Wednesday. I was up until after 3:00 a.m. last night, watching movies with Bethany. There's been a lot of movie-watching happening here lately. Here's my rundown: Last night, we watched ""Thirteen,"" a movie every mother of a teen should see. It was better than I expected. Then we watched ""Gigli,"" and, yes, it was just as bad as the media said, but we had to see for ourselves."
2,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Summer TV used to be a dead zone full of repeats. But now, there are two great new shows on TV, and I have been watching both religiously for the last week. ""Blow Out,"" with the most extravagant concept, surprisingly features no gay people in sight. Hairstylist Jonathan Antin wants to build a second location for his incredibly popular West Hollywood salon, this time in Beverly Hills. Normally, no one, especially not I, would care. However, as I was flipping through the channels, I caught a glimpse of Jonathan, equally narcissistic and dull, looking at an empty space on Rodeo Dr., declaring, ""I am going to build here the greatest salon in the history of the world ever!"" and I was hooked. Not since Rocco have I found such a moron compelling TV viewing."
3,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"What a week ... My right shoulder has tendonitis. It's right under my shoulder blade. So, when I move my arm too much, mainly with a mouse on a computer... it hurts. I can't move it much now because I went on a spree updating my website and working on other online tasks. I can barely find the strength to draw anything. Lack of sleep adds to my pain. I'm not too happy right now, but I'll get better. My mom's surgery went okay. Her eyesight has improved somewhat. She can see fuzzy shapes and make out colors. Other than that, she's still blind. Hopefully, she'll fully regain her vision soon."
4,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Kindness of strangers... Attempted laundry today with the kids and quickly realized how the simplest tasks can become an ordeal. I also discovered how remarkably sweet strangers can be for no reason other than because they feel like it. Trust me. It wasn't like they were trying to get into my pants or anything. I was covered in kid drool and wore my 'wash-day' outfit... Also, I'm not entirely sure I'll bathe again, so it wasn't like there was any olfactory incentive! I am doing two things right now. I am composing a post and also watching the collected No Doubt videos. I am doing both of these while sitting at my desk in my room."
5,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"It's 11:14 PM MST, and here I sit in my bedroom fixing the personal computer of the personnel director from my job. I don't mind doing it, but I sometimes wonder at how often I find myself fixing someone else's computer as a favor. I'm glad to help people this way, but where is the line drawn when it comes to being taken advantage of? The last couple of weeks, I've been staying up late reading and such, so I was looking forward to an early night until I realized it would be more prudent to get this computer out of my bedroom and back to its owner. *laugh* No rest for the weary, right? So I found myself watching Joe Schmo 2 again tonight."
6,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Remind me, what did I write about before this? Or, a continuation in the ""is this a date?"" saga. So, after the weird lunch, my confidence shook. I forgot to tell you an important piece of the story. Before Pat shows up to lunch, Dustin starts talking about what a nice guy Pat is and how he's trying to find a girlfriend for him. I'm listening, nodding, and realizing that we're talking more about finding Dustin's best friend a girl than discussing whatever you discuss with a stranger over pink lemonade. I excused myself to the bathroom, looked in the mirror, and then silently asked myself: am I being pawned off to the other guy? Is this what happens now?"
7,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"I would like everyone to think before they act. In fact, I'd like every single person in the world to think before they get out of bed in the morning and commit to thinking all day. If they're not prepared to, I'd prefer they hop back into bed and drift off to an eternal slumber. I'm sick of dealing with stupid people. I'm not the smartest person in the world, but I'm not talking about things that require a lot of brain power, so I think it's fair to criticize the truly ignorant. Let's see if I can keep this rant focused on a few types, and we'll save some for another day, sound good? Great."
8,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Two issues arise with the scenario outlined in my previous post: 1. It's true that Bush is stimulating the economy, but in the wrong way. Robert Rubin told NPR's Marketplace today that Bush could have achieved the same stimulus effect without long-term debt by enacting different tax cuts—temporary ones benefiting low- and middle-income individuals. Ah, Robert Rubin. The sound of his name is music to our ears. Quick: can you name one Bush administration cabinet official on the domestic side with Rubin's gravitas? Still thinking? It'll come to you... 2. We can't give Republicans control only during wartime because they've ingeniously concocted an endless, global ""war on terrorism."

Went to the Cove to see Supernothing; they were great as usual. Got to chill with Tiago :-) Saturday, I went to work and then out with Joe and Rach, met up with Steve, Tiago, and Tom. Came home around quarter to 12 and woke up the next morning at quarter to 7 for a meet. Got there a bit late, but it's all good—I performed my full routine on the floor without falling. Secured second on floor and vault and third on beam, scoring 29.45 all around, which isn't bad since my meets improve as the season progresses."
10,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Have you ever had one of those moments when you start reflecting on life? Like you're sitting in math class, bored out of your mind, and you wonder what exactly happens in your brain that helps you understand math? Then you realize you exist and you are in math class and wonder why. You understand how amazing existing is. And suddenly it hits you—the fact that you are going off on this random train of thought is incredibly pathetic. Ever experienced that? I hate it. You know what else I hate? Block schedules. Who would ever come up with that idea? Clearly, sitting through a two-and-a-half-hour class in any subject is cruel and unusual punishment."
11,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"I think that Monopoly has run its course in my life, and I vow never to lay my hands on that iron (not a hot one but the game piece) again. Tonight, Andy beat me by a few dollars and won the game, or maybe I let him win since he's leaving in a few hours, and I wanted him to feel good on his last night here. However, the story goes, it can't compare to this Texas-sized headache I have at the moment. I've taken some Aleve, and they are doing the trick; all I need now is some well-deserved R&R... at the drive-in."
12,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Today's been a long day. We drove home from Indiana. I guess I'll need to be choosy about what I write because I could really take up a lot of time and space, and I don't have enough energy. First off, I have to say that camp was awesome, even better than I expected. God's been doing so much in my life lately, and it's just amazing. I've sort of turned over a new leaf, I guess. Anyway, back to the beginning. We arrived at the Twiggs' house on Friday evening and stayed until we left for camp on Monday. Most of what we did was go to the fair, church, a parade, Walmart, and watched movies."
13,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Today is my last day of summer vacation! Waaaaaa! And I have a dentist appointment at 9. I hate that, but I'd rather get it over with than try to schedule it during the first month of my surgery rotation. I'm definitely nervous, scared, jittery, and any other words you can think up for 'hell no, I don't want to go' to school. This is going to be a whole new ball game for me. As a perfectionist, I love excelling at everything I do. But starting new things is tough. I hate being a pawn (like I told Cassie: 'I'm going to be the only pawn on the chessboard who insists on moving like a knight'), and I hate not knowing what's going on."
14,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Arun Shourie discusses how the current governor of Uttar Pradesh had warned, as early as 1996, about the impending threat of the rise of a ""Third Islamic State"" in the subcontinent. T.V. Rajeswar, the former head of the Intelligence Bureau and the current governor of Uttar Pradesh, predicted this ominous threat in a series of articles published in The Hindustan Times, way back in 1996. Shourie raises a valid point when he asks, does knowing that he, not I, nor Mr. Advani, wrote all that, make the warnings seem credible? Or do you conclude that because he expressed this concern, T.V. Rajeswar is a covert communalist and should not be allowed to continue as governor of Uttar Pradesh?"
15,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Attitude: bored; mood: indifferent, yet looking forward to tonight. It's been a long, hard day in the trenches here today, folks—almost no time to write anything for you readers. However, it's good to see Tigger (now Akcron) taking up the reins herself, making an appearance, and discussing various topics :) Not much to say; yesterday was Shakespeare on the Green. It was a lovely play, but I had to leave before the closing curtain, which was disappointing. Hopefully, someday I'll see the entirety of a Shakespeare play. But I digress. Akcron is right about the problems with the shower—it sucks. In terms of laughing at her in the shower, you must admit, the look people get when committing self-torture can be pretty entertaining."
16,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"All of a sudden, over the past two days, I have been plagued by immense exhaustion. Bone-deep exhaustion. Last evening, I went home, fell asleep immediately, and only woke when my mother called me around eight thirty. When I woke up, it was completely dark since I hadn't turned on the lights, leaving me disoriented about the time or date; for a few moments, it was just my mother's voice piercing the darkness while I grappled with reality. I wonder why I'm feeling so drained… The weather this morning is pleasant. It was drizzling when I arrived, although I've heard that in Calcutta, it's been raining for the past three days."
17,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Last night was the worst. I discarded the sweater I was knitting. I only had about 14 inches done and lost approximately $10 worth of yarn (it's $8 a skein). It ended up with too many stitches by the time I reached the armholes, and the mohair tangled itself as I knitted, so frogging (ripping out rows) was ineffective. The yarn frequently broke. I didn't even swear, which is unusual for me. I just morosely unraveled it and listened to season two of Sex and the City (thanks, library!). Eventually, I got fed up and threw it away. I guess I could say I learned a lot while attempting this sweater."
18,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Last night in class, we discussed the week's assigned reading, ""Getting Back into Place: Toward a Renewed Study of the Place-World,"" by Edward S. Casey. The first chapter explores “implacement” and the second, “displacement.” In the initial chapter, Casey distinguishes how our contemporary world and culture revolve around time as the central force: we are running out of time, we have saved time, we are just in time. He argues that centering culture around place could foster a more grounded community. (This is a rough summation, a disclaimer in case my professor or any classmates read this post.) So far, this book is the first reading that has truly engaged me."
19,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Whatever they add to freeze pops to create those colors should come with a warning: may make your life a bit bizarre. While giggling is good, one wonders if we would have ended up on that fire escape drinking beer in the fierce wind had we not eaten them earlier. Finding ourselves in a doorway to a bar, sadly closed for business, we stopped to examine an office supplies catalogue that arrived in the post. Lucky we did. Who could have guessed that within these pages were the special offers of a lifetime? Not I, for certain. I list but a few: buy 36 permanent marker pens, get a stunt kite. Buy 30 lever arch files, get a barbecue."
20,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Currently listening to: ""The Little Drummer Boy"" by Stevan Pasero. And now my post: Senate Republicans, okay, hands up—who watched the 39-hour judicial nominations debate last week? I know I didn't. Well, okay, I did tune in once or twice. The entire waste of time was orchestrated by Republicans, upset that Democrats wouldn't concede and nominate four of Bush's extreme justices, trying to gain political points by holding a multi-day protest. Never mind the fact that Democrats have already approved 168 of Bush's judicial nominees—no, that's not good enough for power-hungry Republicans who, for some reason, are under the false impression they have a huge mandate for this nonsense."
21,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"This was a great weekend. I indulged in much of God's green leaf, and after a while, I listened extensively to Nevermore, something I should have done sooner. I also read a lot, finishing three books: Bruce Sterling's ""Heavy Weather,"" Larry Niven's ""World of Ptavvs,"" and Octavia Butler's ""Parable of the Sower."" ""Heavy Weather"" offered a thrilling cyberpunk exploration of a near-future USA, ravaged by global warming and anarchy. While it was clever, well-paced, and convincing, I must admit that I didn't experience any truly significant emotional impact from the story or characters. Not that they aren't well-constructed and vividly depicted—it's a good book, but not a great one, I suppose."
22,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"The first week back from practicum was a struggle, but it's only in the second week that the smoke has truly started to clear. Post-practicum trauma was a hidden epidemic that is only now coming to light. I was stricken, but the eventual meeting with the course coordinator allowed me to release my burden. By doing so, I have prevented another person from being stuck with such a pedagogically deficient practicum school. Yesterday (Monday), I bumped into another aggrieved classmate who was determined to warn the student assigned to her previous practicum school about its challenges. I calmed her down, suggesting that we should approach the administrator first."
23,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Well, things can get incredibly busy here at times, but there's always time for activities meant to relieve stress. I've discovered that I'm not very good at 8-ball and ping pong! Rick (the Canuck) beats me regularly—we have a ping pong table in the front lobby of our building, so there's always time for a ""quick round."" Last night, I participated in an 8-ball tournament at the hot spot (our recreation tent), which is complete with a popcorn machine, numerous TVs, a jukebox, DVD rental, pool table, dart board, and the ever-present ping pong table. I was doing pretty well throughout my one entire game until I scratched on the eight ball. I still had a good time—the highlight was the two Dutch soldiers who joined in the tournament."
24,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Fall 1974: I was attempting for what felt like the 13th time to battle through the second chapter of my high school algebra book. I was not then, nor am I now, a math person. I hate math. I am math phobic. You get the picture. As I struggled to make sense of algebra, the doorbell rang. I put down my book and went to open the door. No one was there. Great. I returned to my studies, and just as I was finding a glimmer of understanding buried in my subconscious, the doorbell rang again. Bam, just like that, my breakthrough disappeared. I went to the door, and once again, no one was there. Just what a struggling math student needs—an uninvited practical joker."
25,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"This past week has been nothing short of exhausting. I spent Tuesday to Thursday completing the move to my new classroom. The new room is bigger and closer to my grade level team, which are important factors as I spend hours preparing my room for this year. Had I known I would be moving before the end of the school year, I would have discarded many books and supplies I no longer use. Unfortunately, everything came with me. So, this week was spent moving, unpacking, and purging extensively. I must thank my teammate Jill for her help. She was still teaching this month, in my old room, so she and her wonderful students moved almost my entire room for me!"

Forever will I be reminded of the few nights we spent together, hearts and limbs entwined in a soul-embrace, drenched in the salty darkness of an evening by the beach... or a kiss under the rain.

Or let me rephrase that, the article I'm doing and its consequences are not exactly something I'm comfortable with. Perhaps it is because I don't believe in it enough to truly understand its full complexity. The angst behind it. The full-out passion towards it to question. I've grown up in a country where you don't ask questions. Really, you just don't. They punish you for that. They imprison you under all these internal security acts. I am not used to this freedom of speech...not used to questioning out loud. Sure, I am not the easiest person to get along with."

We trekked to the falls, a 30-minute walk that left us breathless. Whew! But we made it. The water was icy, numbing us with its chill. We stayed less than an hour before heading to the nearby waterfalls, another 30 minutes of trekking. The trip was worth it because the falls looked calming, and the whole scene was breathtaking. It felt like becoming one with nature. Soaking in the cold water was like communing with Mother Earth. The chill of the air and water was enough to lull us into serenity."

We have a month left before Ed leaves, and I think it's starting to sink in with Ed and all of us. I believe it hit me a while ago. I just hope Ed will be here for Bailey's surgery.

There is nothing better than seeing the excitement on your child's face. After egg hunting, we all went to church.

I somehow managed to get a flat tire. Luckily, I'm at work, so the guys are going to inflate it for me and make sure it holds air. If not, they'll change my tire and put the spare on.

This situation probably means nothing unless you live around here, so basically I'm happy to be sitting here instead of still in my car.

The movie was all great; I give it 4 1/2 stars because they left out important details! Overall, the movie was good.

Naturalization ceremonies in Jacksonville are being relocated after complaints that GOP activists registered new citizens as Republicans. By Gary Fineout and Alfonso Chardy. The citizenship ceremony in Jacksonville proceeded as usual, with a crowd of nearly 200 people going home as new Americans. Just before the new citizens left the June 29 event, an immigration official conducting the swearing-in urged them to visit a voter registration table—a common sight at naturalization ceremonies. However, this table was unusual: those distributing forms were Republican volunteers, and the party affiliation box had been premarked to enroll all the new voters as GOP members.

As a non-American blogger, I've been a bit hesitant to engage in some of these discussions, particularly about flags, but since I initiated it (the subject, not the flag-burning), I should say something. Firstly, I believe that having a law against flag-burning is completely irrational. The moment you start according a symbol—any symbol—that kind of automatic reverence and protection, you've taken a small yet important step towards totalitarianism. Symbols are quite fickle—they don't inherently represent anything in themselves; it's what they are perceived as meaning or made to represent that's significant."

The character development was quite weak. Furthermore, I thought the score was poor and essentially a knock-off of Gladiator.

Re: Loss of Continuity in PX Day Ahead Auction Due to ISO Rule Changes  

The emergency tariff filing by the California ISO last Friday has negatively impacted the PX Day Ahead Auction Market. The combination of soft and hard caps results in a total disconnect and unacceptable risk to all participants and will likely not provide the ISO with the desired reduction in real-time energy sales and procurement. The overall effect will be that supply will still defer to the higher realized price opportunity the ISO offers. The PX is petitioning Terry Winter of the ISO to immediately allow adjustment bids on any submitted schedule at any relevant price."

This allows services to sell unit contingent energy as hourly firm since BPA is supplying reserves for up to 60 minutes. If Grays Harbor Paper notifies RT of a unit derate or outage, RT should notify BPA dispatch immediately and reduce the schedule during the next ramp. For example, if Grays unit trips at 13:33, RT would notify BPA and the sink that by the top of the hour for 14:00, the schedule would be taken to zero for HE 14:00.

Absolutely amazing, I have nothing negative to say about this game as it has exceeded my expectations and will likely exceed yours too. Fluid movement, bug/crash free, plenty of story/content to engage you, options for each and every day including multiple practices, events (sponsorships), and even games. This review is purely based on playing mycareer, and so far it's 10/10. Facescan worked really well for me (used it two times, although the first one gave me a peculiar forehead).

97,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Magic fans, beware... Wizards of the Coast seems hesitant to create a worthwhile digital game. Fundamentally, Magic: The Gathering is a social experience—a game to enjoy with friends (or frenemies), sharing laughs, talking smack, and executing game-winning moves. Unfortunately, Wizards of the Coast appears to have lost sight of this. When playing with friends, you can't earn gold, and gold is crucial. The importance of gold is highlighted by a daily cap, understandable given it unlocks everything in the game. Prepare for a tedious and monotonous 1v1 grind against the computer or random opponents, whom you can't communicate with. If you opt to play for free, expect to spend around 4 hours daily for almost a month by yourself to unlock the cards."
98,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Being the third installment in the trilogy, I'll address the drawbacks first. I dislike prequels as they technically move backwards in a story rather than forwards (a common issue for every prequel). Granted, they offer more in terms of story. The combat feels sloppy and lacks the precision Arkham City achieved. As of writing this recommendation (26/10/2013), there is a game-breaking bug that prevents a side mission from ever being completed (main story unaffected). Some gadgets are assigned a ridiculous hotkey, requiring your hand to travel across the keyboard to use it. It might seem minor, but during combat, it could potentially disrupt your combo."
99,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"They significantly improved Shadow Warrior (2013). The boss fights are incredible, and the weapons feel satisfying (perhaps not quite as impressive as DOOM's, but still solid). Enemies aren't too resilient (as long as you handle elemental and upgrade features wisely). The upgrade system is well-balanced, and once you get familiar with it, it isn't cumbersome. The elemental system and limited ammo encourage diverse weapon usage. There are many cool, unique weapons that remain effective throughout most of the game. The music is fantastic, particularly the main theme and, of course, Stan Bush's contributions."
100,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"So many things were made wrong. I don't even know how to start this review. This all refers to MyCareer. My player is an outside scorer, PG, 1.71m, with maxed stats and all necessary perks. Why does shooting skill depend on a person's height? Why can't a person who is 1.74m become as good at shooting as someone who is 1.71m? I'm 1.87m in real life, made my first player with this height and noticed I can't reach a higher skill than 89. Why? That's pure discrimination! And why doesn't the game inform me before I create a character, and not even when I reach the skill limit after weeks of playing?!"
101,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"I believe this Assassin's Creed installment truly mastered the mechanics across the board (ship battles, sailing, hunting, parkour, etc). I felt much more connected to this character as well. The story begins rather rough but improves significantly as you progress (I think this is true for every AC game personally). Edward was quite an intriguing character, and so were all the side characters. I felt like all the collectibles actually meant something in this AC game, which I never got from any of the previous ones. Maybe it's because they seemed to have a bigger purpose. They definitely were not required, but they were fun to collect, and you were rewarded in a very balanced way."
102,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"While I personally cannot recommend this game, it wasn't entirely terrible. The gunplay is decent, provided you have the money to purchase gun parts, which is my primary complaint: it's pay-to-win. If I could get past that, the game would be enjoyable, as the hardsuit is fun and HRV is an excellent idea. I'd choose this game over any Call of Duty title, but its pay-to-win microtransaction model is off-putting for me. If you are comfortable with this model, then by all means, enjoy it. But if you're like me and dislike pay-to-win games, let this one slide; it's not our cup of tea."
103,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"While not perfect, this game has been highly enjoyable. The save system and possibility of sudden death lead to some frustration. On my first playthrough, I lost my main character around hour 10 of 20ish. I would have really liked a save to reload at that point. I've since picked up a third-party mod/save tool to avoid catastrophic failures. Plus, the aiming reticule is on the small side, and zoom is underpowered. With all that said, it's been a blast. I'm not typically a zombie fan, but the combination of strategy, missions, and first-person shooter/beat-'em-up elements is great. I've been playing it as often as I can... Just one more mission, just one more supply run—or I'm running away and want to get safe before shutting down the game."
104,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"An absolutely great strategy game! Having played every single other wargame (European Escalation and ALB), I must say this one fits well. The number of units is amazing. Not sure exactly how many units there are, but there are a ton! The graphics are beautiful, the sounds are great, and the gameplay overall is epic. The in-game chat box at the main menu is very entertaining as well; I'm not kidding. However, if anyone is thinking this game is 'easy,' or if you are new to the strategy genre, it might take you some time to master it. Do not get upset; you will lose units. Just plan ahead and always have anti-air and anti-tank capabilities."
105,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"I was negatively biased towards this game before I played it, unsure of buying it. The whole portal gun and portals concept seemed odd to me, even though I enjoy science fiction. Boy, was I wrong. The jokes and voice acting in this game are phenomenal. Just amazing. It's not cheesy (okay, it's sometimes cheesy). The different story characters each have their own sense of humor. Those unique characters truly have distinct personalities. And the level design is just rad. By the way, I never played the first Portal game. One of these days, I'm planning to if I can spare the time. I would never have played it if I hadn't played the sequel."
106,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Let's begin with the pros and cons, followed by my thoughts on this game.  

**Pros:**  
+ Some of the best characters  
+ Good story  
+ Loads of content  
+ Customizable character (you can be male or female, whatever you like)  
+ You can have a relationship with most of your companions (yes, fangirls, you can have a love interest)

**Cons:**  
- Bad graphics (I don't think graphics really matter anyway)  
- Weird and awkward love scenes  
- Invisible walls  
- There's one mission that, in my opinion, was boring, but everyone has different tastes  

**Neutral:**  
- Your protagonist can't talk, but this isn't necessarily good or bad  

Now for my thoughts. I love this game. This game is probably one of the best RPGs or games in general I have ever played. So, if you’re an RPG fan, you probably already have this game."
107,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Yes, this is a nostalgic trip for those in their thirties who remember (at least in the UK) watching the ever-irritating Timmy Mallett just for the five-minute Transformers cartoon. The voice actors for Optimus, Megatron, Bumblebee, and many others are back and instantly recognizable. The distinctive cartoon transformation sound is there. Graphically, the cel-shaded presentation is perfect and very, very Generation One. But aside from that, it's actually a very fun game. The combat mechanics are extremely well done. Transforming mid-fight is often a necessity and woven seamlessly into combos, making it quite unlike High Moon's excellent War for/Fall of Cybertron games. Another distinction is the heavy focus on melee combat, though some enemies (e.g. Seekers) require a switch to a ranged blaster."
108,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"I downloaded the game and played it for a bit, and it was nothing special. I spent more time trying to log in than actually playing. There’s a bug where it says there's an update to the terms of service, and when you click 'accept,' it just pops up again. You have to restart the client for it to work. That isn’t too bad, but why do I need to link my Steam and Gface accounts? They say it’s for DLC, but why is that necessary? It’s irreversible, so now I know a company I don't care about has access to my Steam information. The game itself is mediocre. It’s easily recognizable as a COD clone, except they managed to make the gunplay worse... How is that possible?"
109,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"4K+ at 60fps (GTX 970), dual audio options, and includes Neptune gear. What's not to love? Excellent port and a great entry point if you're new to the series. Just keep in mind there is lots of (skippable) talking. As usual, I would suggest using a gamepad, but personally, I had no problems with a keyboard/mouse setup; both are completely rebindable. The price is reasonable, and I wouldn't have been unhappy with the purchase. More than half the DLC is included free, which is still plenty to enjoy. Recommended game for all JRPG/anime/visual novel fans, provided you don't mind long breaks between the action. Cheers."
110,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"I experienced no performance issues even at release, and after all these patches, it plays exceptionally well. In my opinion, this is a truly great and fun game, although the format can be somewhat annoying, as the free-roam city area repopulates with new enemies whenever you progress in the story. I particularly enjoyed the 'dual play' segments, where you can play Batman plus one other character. The ability to use the controller for most segments of the game while switching to mouse and keyboard for the tank combat segments was greatly appreciated. Driving your Batmobile around the free-roam city, including when chasing the APC commanders, becomes quite enjoyable once you master skidding around corners—and when you master that, navigating the city becomes truly enjoyable!"
111,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Exceptional AAA FPS shooter—that's the bottom line. It looks, sounds, and plays wonderfully—great FPS mechanics, engaging story, intriguing characters, exceptional voice acting, and an impressive soundtrack. However, it's not for the faint-hearted—some cutscenes are quite intense. But when a game overall is this outstanding, it's easier to notice the flaws, and here they are as I observed them: - No SLI support—it's baffling. I had to shelve the game until upgrading my card because it ran poorly on my old dual GPU GTX 590. Ensure you have a decent single GPU card. - Frustratingly, small obstacles are often unclimbable."
112,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"English is not my native language. I am Dutch, so please overlook any typing or grammatical errors in my review of this fantastic game. I will break down this review into several categories: - graphics - controls - sound - gameplay - replayability. Graphics: The game features a comic-like style, with very sleek presentation and no unnecessary details. The color schemes are well-chosen and work perfectly for this game. The graphics can be set to 'high' without overloading your system. I run this game on an i5 processor with an NVIDIA GeForce 710M card and 8GB memory, and it runs smoothly on Windows 8.1. Controls: The game can be played with a keyboard and mouse, or with an Xbox controller."
113,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"You can see from the hours I've put into this game that I enjoy it. This is everything I wished a search game from COD would be. But don't buy this game thinking it's like COD, Battlefield, or any other shooter game. It's in its own class and should be treated as such. Can't tell you how many times I hear new players complaining about getting killed quickly. Oh, forbid you get shot in the face and die. It's not like that doesn't happen in real life or anything. Edit: I've been playing this game for a while now. Thrown all kinds of money at it. One of the best multiplayer games around. A good thing to play when you're not feeling CS:GO."
114,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"I'm two hours in and absolutely enthralled by this game. It's hilarious. The gameplay is solid, the art design beautiful, and the music is surprisingly high-quality and fitting. I'm intrigued by the story and world, and the puzzles are enjoyable. However, the comedy is the standout feature. If you've played any RPG since the dawn of video games, you'll appreciate the jokes, parodies, and references. Even newcomers to RPGs will enjoy the humor. If you've played Final Fantasy VII or X, this game is a must-play. Without giving too much away, I had to stop after two hours to give my cheeks a break from laughing and smiling so much. What a delight so far."
115,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"I'm truly sorry. I try to support free-to-play games and indie developers, but I really didn't enjoy this game. The description seemed perfect for me, but the execution fell short. I love puzzle and exploration games, yet I found this one completely unintuitive. Even after looking up how to progress, I just didn't find the gameplay fun. Additionally, it lacks a pause button—or if it does have one, I never found it. Given that many sequences are timed, this seems like a critical oversight. I also feel this game is more cut scenes than actual gameplay, leaving me drumming my fingers frequently."
116,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"This game... Phew, where to even start? It was absolutely beautiful; from story to graphics, I was hooked. The story wasn't just any story, but it felt like I was that person, trying to figure out what came next in the narrative my character was telling. The gameplay was fantastic, and I learned a lot about myself through this game (mainly my fear of heights, which I never had a problem with until the ice caverns). My gut churned the whole time, but I persevered for Uncle Fred! If you guys made a DLC or second game, I would be the first to buy it and recommend it to everyone I know. Thanks to everyone involved in making this; you crafted an absolutely beautiful game."
117,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth is a turn-based game where you develop your civilization to achieve a specific goal or ""victory"". In previous installments, you navigated Earth's timeline, moving through eras like the Stone Age, Medieval Age, and the Modern Age. However, in this game, you're set in the future, embarking on a mission to colonize a new planet. What I enjoy about this game is that 2K adopted a fresh approach, adding innovative mechanics like the affinity system and orbital layer. One downside is these new features can be overwhelming. What I think could be improved is incorporating additional artwork to enhance the environments experienced during interactions with other leaders."
118,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Great game! Tons of replayability and a very fun zombie survival experience! Definitely in my top 5 zombie games ever played. After playing 60+ hours, I can honestly say this is one of the better and more ""realistic"" zombie games. It's designed like a survival horror, requiring you to save ammo, heal wounds, and take pills when infected. Additionally, I find the zombies to be well-animated for a free-to-play game. I recommend getting one or two friends to play with, but the community is super friendly, and you can usually make friends or chat with people in the game."
119,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"02/07/2014 - It's unfortunate I can't fully recommend or enjoy this game, as from the brief time I've played, I know I'd be hooked if it weren't for these two major issues. No Australian servers - one red bar puts you at a significant disadvantage and creates unbearable lag. Mind you, I played through the offline training mode and it was stuttering and lagging as well (how does that even happen?). Combine that with poor ping, and it just ruins the game. Everything artifacts excessively - the menus, backgrounds, training, and in-game. I've never experienced this issue before with this card and thought it might dislike my overclock. I set my GPU back to stock, and it didn't make a difference."
120,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Late last night, I finished this. The story isn't very deep or interesting, but what makes it stand out is the storytelling. The atmosphere is immersive, and the many collectibles do a great job of fleshing it out. I learned a lot about the world of Batman, so it was disappointing that so few bosses were in the game. Oh well, there are enough future games to rectify that. The combat offers the right amount of challenge, but it leans more towards the easy side. Leveling up Batman wasn't satisfying; it's the gadgets you upgrade and acquire during the campaign that add nice new gameplay mechanics. Accessing previously unreachable places provides a satisfying sense of progression."
121,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"'To The Moon' is no mere game... Nay, it is a veritable experience, and it was one of the best of my life at that. Think Telltale's 'The Walking Dead' is sad? Hohoho! Well, it's no match for 'To The Moon!' Never before have I been so deeply moved yet fulfilled by something purely fictional. This masterpiece represents the pinnacle of storytelling in my opinion, and the soundtrack is a gorgeously charming and perfect accompaniment. Yes, the controls are a bit finicky and the gameplay is not the strong point, but the story is so fantastic that I did not care at all. Plus, the humor of the game is great as well and it definitely does not intrude upon the distinguished nature of the story... And the Doctor Who references are endless."
122,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Bastion is an exceptionally brilliant game with an engaging storyline. Set in a post-calamity world, you begin to rebuild the bastion. There's a multitude of choices in the game—determining what to construct for an advantage, selecting the weapons and power-ups, and choosing drinks for bonus effects. The art style and music are fantastic, with vibrant visuals proving the apocalypse need not be dull. Best of all, the game features dynamic narration based on your actions. For example, if you pick up a weapon and then swap it for another in the armory, the narration reflects your decision to take along the new weapon."
123,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"I originally purchased this game during its early development phase when only ""spacebux"" was used as currency, and there was no ""tech tree."" This is when the game was at its best. All the guns were equally overpowered, so there were no imbalance issues; everyone could eliminate opponents at any time. Additionally, the game used to allow unlimited gun slots and five loadouts. You would think that for a game boasting ""bajillions of guns,"" they would at least offer more than six weapon slots and three loadouts before requiring payment for additional slots. At one point, I had around three pages of guns and was planning new ideas, because, for me, that's where the enjoyment came from."
124,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"This game was a surprising gem. Often, rave reviews about products can be misleading, but in this case, the reviews truly capture the fun of this neat little game. It's an odd mix between a classic 2D platformer and a MOBA, executed with style. I found myself enjoying characters I wouldn't typically enjoy in other MOBA games. Expecting this pattern to continue, I gave a melee tank a try anyway and was pleasantly surprised with the outcome, prompting me to experiment more as they were unlocked through playing. The art style and interface are charmingly unique. Consequently, I now use one of the characters as my avatar and a wallpaper from creating a card set for the game."
125,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"I just started playing, but I love this game. I put on my headphones and lose myself in the game for hours at a time. It's been a while since a game has had that effect on me. The music sets the mood, the sound effects are spot on, and the controls are perfect. I look forward to every combat encounter, and they've optimized combat extremely well. I had my doubts about the naval combat system, but it is so much fun to lay waste to multiple fleets at a time! The only way to lose in this game is to fail to retreat. If the combat looks overwhelming, just get out of there, regroup, and counter-assault. Thanks, devs, for an awesome experience!"
126,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"The reboot of the Devil May Cry franchise has brought numerous changes, particularly for the series' protagonist, Dante. While fans of the original series may be upset at the changes to their beloved character, it's undeniably for the better; this new game by Ninja Theory proves it. DmC serves as the perfect point for newcomers to jump into the series. It shows the origins of an arrogant, cynical Dante, and it chronicles his journey from cynicism to selflessness. Throughout, the game weaves a clear, narrative arc for the new Dante, making him a compelling character to watch. The story follows Dante as he's introduced to the corrupt world he willfully chose to ignore."
127,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Where do I start with this absolutely beautiful game? Its story is truly charming. It is filled with detail and is a bundle of happiness, bad puns, annoying dogs, and secrets. It is serious when necessary but doesn't shy away from funny moments. The character design is impeccable, featuring various personalities and secrets. It stands out from other RPGs because you don't have to kill anyone, a unique concept. With inspiration from EarthBound, one of the best RPGs I have seen, you can tell it will be good. It has the best soundtrack I've heard in ages."
128,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"I am recommending this purely because it's free and might offer a more enjoyable experience for others. As for my experience, the game did not resonate with me. Half the story hinges on shock value. I was neither shocked nor emotionally moved in any way by this. Perhaps I'm desensitized, or maybe it was too simple to elicit a reaction from me. Regarding the other half of the game, it attempts to illustrate (literally) a person in mental decline. It addresses obsession, hallucination, depression, and a few other themes. In theory, this is a compelling idea. However, the game took me only 10 minutes to complete, even while reading and absorbing every detail I could."
129,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Do I even need to explain why Portal is amazing? Portal is a puzzle game that introduces you to a concept and then lets you explore it. It's an incredible way to challenge your mind while still having fun. Although this game isn’t very story-heavy, it spawned one of the best popular games of 2011. I still play it and beat it when I’m bored, and I love returning to what laid the foundation for a gaming legend. Gameplay: Portal’s gameplay is simple, at least to describe. You strategically use portals, along with buttons that activate parts of the puzzle. There are two types of buttons in the game: one you press, and another that requires a cube to activate."
130,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"If you can overlook the bugs (I personally encountered only two: one minor and the other quite annoying)—both of which have been resolved, and one fix even increased my FPS from 60-90 to 80-120—and are looking for a space exploration game, I can definitely recommend this. Since most of these reviews are about specs, I'll include mine: i5 6600k (~200€), Radeon RX480 (~200€), Z170 Pro-Gaming (~150€), 16GB DDR4 RAM (~70€). ~650€ is definitely within the medium price range, though granted, this rig is quite new. Almost constant 60+ FPS on high settings with VSync enabled. I genuinely can't believe 90% of the comments saying they're using an overkill setup and only getting 20 FPS."
131,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Remember Age of Mythology? It's been a long time since there's been an RTS game of such quality. Divinity: Dragon Commander comes awfully close to ranking among my personal favorite RTS games. Combine this with a compelling grand strategy mode and it hits the spot. I try not to be overly biased due to the fact that this game allows you to transform into a dragon, aiding your troops by supporting, attacking, and even commanding unit production, direction, and spawning simultaneously. Honestly, I do enjoy the intricate RTS games today—think of Civ V and so on. However, such games often cram complex mechanics, charts, and resources into one complicated game mode."

The graphics are solid for a retro title, and the music is pleasant, but together they create truly beautiful and impactful moments. The script ranges from comedic to dramatic, heartbreaking to hopeful, sometimes simultaneously, and subverts RPG tropes in the process. And that's without even mentioning the world, characters, story, or gameplay... I could write entire pages about it. But instead, I'll just say this: if you like RPGs, play this game. If you enjoy video games, play this game. If you have seven free hours between now and your death, play this game."

There is a fairly steep learning curve to the game's mechanics, which I am still trying to master; however, this breadth of strategy offers myriad ways to reach goals and seize opportunities. The game, in my opinion, is almost infinitely replayable. I find myself immersed in every session, regardless of how the playthrough is going."

It's great for casual play, though it may not hold your attention beyond a few months unless you really enjoy grinding. The upside is that the game is free, so I'd recommend giving it a try.

Sadly, it's far from it. In this game, you absorb progressively larger objects to grow and absorb bigger items. However, the gameplay lacks smoothness, the levels aren't inventive, and what it contains is a surreal horror show. It's not an entertaining horror show, but one that makes you feel rather depressed and question whether life is as it should be. Every 'living' creature in this game, from small pets to humans, makes me wonder if the creators had an unusual interest in taxidermy."

The game starts by requiring you to choose a side: Republican or Democrat—no option for independents or third parties. A little disappointed but still hopeful, I continued to explore. I will give the game credit; the character customization, although limited, is quite entertaining to play with. It's the only time you can choose whether or not to wear your head during a campaign.

You don't have to earn power armor; it’s basically given to you from the start of the game, with power cores abundantly found in trader shops. The value of power armor is greatly reduced compared to previous Fallout games. The story is mediocre, and everything about this game is mediocre, except it doesn’t crash every 10 minutes like Fallout 3. It’s very stable compared to Fallout 3. Is it better than Fallout 3?

Initially, the game set the graphics to high, causing some sluggishness, but not to the point of being unplayable. When I lowered the settings to medium, it smoothed out.

Cathy Jamieson explained that exclusion orders are among several measures being considered in the Scottish executive campaign against sectarianism. She commended Celtic and Rangers for their efforts to tackle the problem. However, the minister emphasized that eliminating sectarian abuse associated with Old Firm matches is a key objective. Ms. Jamieson spoke ahead of the third-round Scottish Cup clash between the Glasgow clubs at Parkhead on Sunday. The sectarianism long linked with certain sections of support from both clubs has become a significant target for the executive. Last week, Ms. Jamieson and First Minister Jack McConnell met supporters' representatives from both clubs to discuss the issue."

However, the essentially linear interaction between motion and light or electricity prevents access to a broader class of quantum states of motion, such as cat states or energy squeezed states. Indeed, early optomechanical proposals highlighted the potential to overcome this restriction by creating strong quadratic coupling of motion to light. Although experiments have demonstrated quadratically coupled optomechanical systems, they have not yet accessed nonclassical states of motion."

Additionally, most existing detectors prioritize detection accuracy, which doesn't align well with the goal of preserving the trustworthiness of product evaluations. To address these challenges, we propose a minimax game framework where spammers and spam detectors compete based on practical goals beyond just detection accuracy.

Among this family, we identify a tracking solution with a single parameter to control the fidelity of the transfer, the population of the excited state, and robustness.

We show that all local minima share a structural similarity, partially identifying the component centers of the true mixture. Each local minimum involves a unique combination of fitting multiple Gaussians to a single true component and fitting a single Gaussian to multiple true components. Our results apply to cases where the true mixture components meet a certain separation condition and remain valid even with over- or under-specified component numbers. For Gaussian mixtures with three components, our findings yield sharper results regarding scaling with the separation between components."

For $n$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-like states, the most robust witness scheme requires $n+1$ local measurement settings and can tolerate up to $1/2$ white noise.

These geometries can break the axial and equatorial symmetry of the Kerr metric and possess a much richer multipolar structure, providing a means to constrain fuzzball models phenomenologically. We find numerical evidence that all multipole moments are typically larger (in magnitude) than those of a Kerr black hole with equivalent mass and spin.

The nonparametric formulation of this approach, known as modal clustering, aligns the groups with the domains of attraction of the density modes. Operationally, it requires a nonparametric density estimate and a proper selection of the smoothing amount, which governs the density's shape, and potentially, the modal structure.

In this scenario, carefully measuring the azimuthal decay angles ""resurrects"" the interference, restoring sensitivity to the ""non-interfering"" operators. We explore these signatures in detail and find that the EFT uncertainties associated with higher-dimensional operators are uniquely well-suppressed by constructing an asymmetry variable, generated only by these non-interfering operators. This relegates the effects of higher-dimensional, interfering operators to the same status as statistical errors in this observable."

This note demonstrates that, for a generic Einstein quantum theory of gravity in AdS, exact stability of extremal black branes is in tension with rigorously proven quantum information theorems about entanglement entropy. Avoiding the contradiction leads to a nonperturbative version of the WGC, which aligns with the usual statement at weak coupling.

Here, we demonstrate superfluidity in an ultracold 2D Fermi gas by moving a periodic potential through the system and observing no dissipation below a critical velocity \(v_{\rm c}\).

The method approximates an ODE model with a state-space model based on the equations of a numerical solver, allowing rapid estimation by avoiding computations of a complete numerical solution in the likelihood. The posterior is derived using a variational Bayes method, specifically the approximate Riemannian conjugate gradient method (Honkela et al.)."
220,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"We study the transport properties and superconducting proximity effect in NSN junctions formed by a time-reversal symmetry-broken Weyl semimetal (WSM) in proximity to an s-wave superconductor. We find that the differential conductance and induced pairing amplitudes strongly depend on the angle between the junction direction in real space and the axis separating the Weyl nodes in momentum space. We identify the influence of a chiral chemical potential, i.e., the electron population imbalance between Weyl nodes of opposite chirality, on the transport characteristics of the junction. Notably, we observe a net spin polarization of Cooper pairs generated via Andreev reflection in the two WSM regions. The spin polarization is opposite in these regions and highly sensitive to the chirality imbalance and excitation energy."
221,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"Metal ion implantation into ceramics has been shown to be an effective and controllable technique for tailoring the surface electrical conductivity of the ceramic piece, and this approach is used in numerous applications. Importantly, it provides a way to manage the voltage drop across high voltage insulators, thereby increasing the maximum operational voltage that can be applied to the insulator without surface flashover. However, a concern for the use of the method is the long-term stability of the implantation-induced conductivity, particularly if the implanted metal species is readily oxidized. Here, we discuss our examination of the long-term behavior of the surface conductivity of titanium-implanted alumina. The results indicate that after an initial drop of up to 40% in the first few weeks post-implantation, the conductivity shows only a very gradual decrease of about 10% over the following year."

The associated charge is equivalent to the Skyrmion charge for any smooth configuration. Additionally, there exist singular configurations identified as \( n_f=1 \) baryons charged under the new symmetry. Vector mesons act as Chern-Simons vector fields on the quantum Hall droplet forming the \( n_f=1 \) baryon. We propose this current as the correct effective expression for the baryon current at low energies. This proposal provides a unified picture for two types of baryons, enabling their continuous transformation in a natural manner. Moreover, Chern-Simons dualities on the droplet can be seen as Seiberg-like dualities between gluons and vector mesons."

We theoretically study how the combination of these effects impacts superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator/superconductor junctions' transport properties. Transverse momentum-dependent skew tunneling of Cooper pairs through the spin-active ferromagnetic insulator interface generates sizable transverse Hall supercurrents, which we refer to as anomalous Josephson Hall effect currents. We generalize the Furusaki-Tsukada formula, initially established to quantify typical Josephson current flows, to evaluate the transverse current components and show that their amplitudes are adjustable via the spin-orbit coupling strengths or the superconducting phase difference across the junction. As a spectroscopic signature of Josephson junctions, well-localized subgap bound states form around the interface."

(2020), which propose that dipoles are as important to the dynamics of decaying two-dimensional turbulence as individual vortex cores, it is found that the kinetic energy of this flow is carried by elongated streams formed by the concatenation of dipoles. Vortices separate into a family of small, fast-moving cores and another family of larger, slowly moving ones, which can be described as 'frozen' into a slowly evolving 'crystal'. The kinematics of both families differ significantly, and only the former is self-similar. The latter is responsible for most of the kinetic energy of the flow, and its vortices form the dipoles and streams. Mechanisms are discussed for the growth of this slow component."

In this article, we present improved upper bounds for the quantum hitting time applicable to numerous ctqw-based quantum algorithms. Specifically, we apply our methods to the glued-trees problem, enhancing their hitting time upper bound by a polynomial factor: from $o(n^5)$ to $o(n^2\log n)$.

Dry EMRIs, also known as the ""loss-cone"" EMRIs, were previously considered the primary EMRI sources for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. They are mainly produced by multi-body scattering in the nuclear star cluster and gravitational capture. Here, we highlight an alternative formation channel: wet EMRI formation, assisted by the accretion flow around accreting galactic-center massive black holes (MBHs). In this channel, the accretion disk captures stellar-mass black holes initially moving on inclined orbits, then drives them to migrate toward the MBH. This process significantly boosts the EMRI formation rate in such galaxies."

Under such circumstances, we still hope our recommender systems can attract users initially so that they decide to stay on the website and become active users. This issue is known as the new user cold-start problem, and it is crucial for a company's development and even survival. Existing approaches to address user cold-start recommendations either require additional user efforts, such as setting up interviews, or utilize side information such as user demographics, locations, and social relations. However, users may not be willing to participate in interviews, and side information for cold-start users is often not available."

It has also found success in wireless communications, despite the fact that current radio systems are well-understood and optimal algorithms exist for many tasks. While gains have been achieved by learning individual parts of a receiver, a more effective approach is to jointly learn the entire receiver. This, however, often results in a challenging nonlinear problem, where the optimal solution is infeasible to implement. To address this, we propose a deep fully convolutional neural network, deeprx, which executes the entire receiver pipeline from frequency domain signal stream to uncoded bits in a 5G-compliant manner. We enhance channel estimation accuracy by constructing the input of the convolutional neural network specifically using both the data and pilot symbols."
229,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"Mutation-based fuzzing typically begins with an initial set of non-crashing seed inputs (a corpus) used to generate new inputs through mutation. A corpus often contains thousands of similar inputs. This lack of diversity can result in wasted effort through exhaustive mutation from all available seeds. To mitigate this, fuzzers come equipped with distillation tools (e.g., afl-cmin) that select the smallest subset of seeds, triggering the same range of instrumentation data points as the full corpus. Common practice suggests that minimizing the seed count and cumulative size enhances fuzzing efficiency. We systematically explore this by presenting results of 34+ cpu-years of fuzzing with five distillation approaches to understand their impact on finding bugs in real-world software."

Agents can be divided into groups, each with similar (isomorphic) state transition structures, allowing them to be relabeled into the same template. Based on this template, a scalable supervisor is designed whose state size and computational cost remain constant, irrespective of the number of agents, for the partial observation scenario. This scalable supervisor does not need recomputation, no matter how many agents are added or removed. We extend our previous findings to partial observation by proposing sufficient conditions for ensuring safety and maximal permissiveness of the least restrictive scalable supervisor at the template level. An example is presented to demonstrate the proposed method of scalable supervisory synthesis."

An efficient method for ENF estimation is introduced using temporal windowing based on the filter-bank Capon spectral estimator. A type of Gohberg-Semencul factorization of the model covariance matrix is employed due to its Toeplitz structure. Notably, this approach utilizes, for the first time in the field of ENF, a temporal window, not strictly rectangular, in the phase preceding spectral estimation. Krylov matrices are applied for efficient matrix inversions. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art ENF estimation techniques when a short time window of 1 second is used in power recordings. In speech recordings, the proposed method delivers highly accurate results concerning both time complexity and accuracy."

Here, we examined the fluorescence anomalous saturating effect of the nitrogen vacancy defect in diamond. A reduction in fluorescence was observed with high-power laser excitation. It enhanced the nonlinearity of the fluorescence emission and altered the spatial frequency distribution of the fluorescence image. We employed a differential excitation protocol to extract high spatial frequency information. By modulating the excitation laser's power, the spatial resolution of imaging improved approximately 1.6 times compared to confocal microscopy. Given the simplicity of the experimental setup and data processing, we anticipate this method can be used to enhance the spatial resolution of sensing and biological labeling with the defects in solids."

We develop a weight-exponentiated formulation for the random effects distribution that ensures unbiased inference for generating hyperparameters of the random effects. We compare our method with frequentist techniques that utilize numerical integration, revealing that only the Bayesian approach attains both unbiased estimation with respect to the sampling design distribution and consistency with the population generating distribution. Our simulations and real data example on a survey of business establishments highlight our approach's effectiveness across various modeling formulations and sampling designs. This work acts as a capstone for recent efforts that merge traditional survey estimation methods with the Bayesian modeling paradigm and bridges these two rich yet distinct sub-fields."

For the first time, it was discovered that in a mesogenic polymer, unlike low-molecular-weight mesogens, the relaxation of the electric birefringence of a melt above the temperature of the nematic-isotropic phase transition can be represented by a combination of several exponential processes, two of which play a decisive role. These main processes succeed each other within a temperature range of about fifty degrees. Dielectric spectroscopy also enabled the identification of two processes of orientational relaxation: the first is due to the rotation of the side mesogenic groups, and the second is associated with the motion of the main chain segments."

The optimization of discrete hash bits remains a pivotal focus in deep hashing approaches. A prevalent strategy involves using an activation function, such as $\operatorname{sigmoid}(\cdot)$ or $\operatorname{tanh}(\cdot)$, and minimizing a quantization loss to approximate discrete values. However, this approach can cause hash bits to become entrenched in the incorrect saturated areas of the activation functions, making them irretrievable. We refer to this issue as the ""dead bits problem~(dbp)."" Moreover, the current quantization loss exacerbates dbp. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective gradient amplifier, applied before activation functions, to mitigate dbp."

This standard model suggests an initially circular and narrow belt of planetesimals at semi-major axis $a$, whose eccentricity is increased to $e_f$ after the gas disc disperses due to secular perturbations from an eccentric planet, resulting in a belt of width $2ae_f$. Through a minor modification of this scenario, narrower belts can emerge if the planetesimals are initially eccentric, possibly due to earlier planetary perturbations during the gas-rich protoplanetary disc phase. Alternatively, a primordial eccentricity might arise from instabilities that increase the disc's eccentricity, without needing any planets."

Here, we report on measurements of many-body modes in 1D gated-wires using a tunneling spectroscopy technique. We observe two separate Fermi seas at high energies, associated with spin and charge excitations, together with the emergence of three additional 1D 'replica' modes that strengthen with decreasing wire length.

To this end, we combined the kinematic information provided by Gaia for nearly all galactic clusters with the largest sample of cluster ages available, after carefully correcting for systematic errors.

This few-get-richer effect emerges in contexts with few distinct classes of items (e.g., left-leaning versus right-leaning news sources), ranked based on popularity. We demonstrate analytically that the few-get-richer effect arises when users tend to click on top-ranked items and have diverse preferences for item classes.

With carefully designed patterns, our pruning achieves accuracy enhancement and improved feature extraction across different DNN structures and datasets. Furthermore, our pattern-aware pruning framework accomplishes pattern library extraction, pattern selection, pattern and connectivity pruning, and weight training simultaneously.

I started in 1999 to address this issue with an experiment, which was very simple, conducted in New Delhi."
266,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"Currently, most refugees reside in cities rather than refugee camps, comprising over 60 percent of the global refugee population. With this urban majority, a paradigm shift and fresh thinking are essential. Instead of squandering resources on building walls, it's more beneficial to invest in programs enabling refugees to be self-sufficient. (applause) We always have to abandon our possessions, but not our skills and knowledge. If permitted to lead productive lives, refugees can support themselves and contribute to their host country's development. I was born in Bukavu, South Kivu, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. I am the fifth of 12 children."
267,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"I have two questions for you. One: whose shoulders do you stand on? And two: what do you stand for? These are two questions that I always begin my poetry workshops with because, at times, poetry can seem like a dead art form for old white men who just seem like they were born to be old, like Benjamin Button or something. I ask my students these two questions, and then I share how I answer them, which is in these three sentences: I am the daughter of Black writers descended from freedom fighters who broke their chains and changed the world. They call me. These are words I repeat as a mantra before every poetry performance. In fact, I was doing it in the corner over there, making faces."
268,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"I didn't always make my living from music. For about five years after graduating from a reputable liberal arts university, this was my day job. I worked as a self-employed living statue known as the eight-foot bride, and I love telling people this was my job because everyone always wonders about the lives of these performers. I painted myself white one day, stood on a box, placed a hat or can at my feet, and when someone dropped in money, I handed them a flower and some intense eye contact. If they didn't take the flower, I added a gesture of sadness and longing as they walked away."
269,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"On October 4, 1957, the world watched in awe and fear as the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the first man-made satellite, into space. This small metal ball, less than two feet in diameter, initiated a space race between the U.S. and USSR that would last for eighteen years and transform the world as we know it. Sputnik was not actually the first piece of human technology to enter space. That distinction belongs to the V-2 rocket used by Germany in missile attacks against Allied cities in the final years of World War II. It wasn't very effective, but, at the end of the war, both the U.S. and USSR had captured the technology and the scientists who developed it, using them for their own projects."

I'm a voracious reader, one who delves into Ian McEwan down to Stephanie Meyer.

We are in a race against time, and we are losing. There is a growing impatience, especially among young people, with global inaction. We need more ambition from all: governments, cities, businesses, investors, and people everywhere. So I’m pleased you are launching TED Countdown. Your influence and ideas can help accelerate momentum for a carbon-neutral world by 2050. That is the only way to avert the worst impacts of global heating. We have the tools, the science, and the resources. Let us now get into this race with political will and energy."
272,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"Menstruation. A simple word for a natural biological process, yet burdened by centuries of stigma and transformed into something most of us speak about in whispers. But why? As I speak to you now, over 800 million women worldwide are having their period. None of us would exist without it, yet it remains an ""embarrassing"" topic to discuss. From my experience and those of the women around me, I can tell you it's exhausting. It's exhausting to discreetly pull out a pad from a brown paper bag, hide it in your pocket in class, and rush to the washroom as quietly as possible. It's exhausting to sit through lessons and meetings pretending to be perfectly normal while suffering from intense period cramps."
273,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"The largest and most devastating environmental and industrial project is located in the heart of the largest and most intact forest in the world: Canada's boreal forest. It stretches across northern Canada, in Labrador, and is home to the largest remaining wild caribou herd: the George River caribou herd, numbering approximately 400,000 animals. Unfortunately, when I was there, I couldn't find one of them, but you have the antlers as proof. Across the boreal, we're blessed with an incredible abundance of wetlands, which are globally among the most endangered ecosystems. They're absolutely critical, cleaning the air and water, sequestering large amounts of greenhouse gases, and supporting a vast diversity of species."
274,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"Before the world of humans began, there existed the world of the gods, a realm of fields, plains, and gardens. Four brothers roamed this celestial domain. They had no family apart from one another—they didn't even know their parents. One brother, Deminan, differed in appearance. His skin was covered in painful scabs, and he pondered why he alone bore this affliction. One day, while the supreme spirit Yaya was out in his gardens, Deminan and his brothers sneaked into Yaya’s house. After feasting and exploring, they noticed a giant gourd hanging in a corner. Attempting to look inside the gourd, they accidentally dropped it."
275,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"Seven years ago, I graduated from Berkeley with a dual degree in Molecular and Cell Biology and Linguistics. I attended a career fair on campus and secured an interview with a startup called Theranos. At that time, there wasn't much information about the company, but what little was available seemed impressive. Essentially, the company was developing a medical device capable of running an entire blood panel using just a finger-stick of blood. This meant you wouldn't need a large needle inserted into your arm for a blood test. It was interesting not only because it was less painful but also for its potential to open doors to predictive diagnostics."
276,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"My journey to becoming a polar specialist, photographing and specializing in the polar regions, began when I was four years old. My family moved from southern Canada to northern Baffin Island, near Greenland. There, we lived with the Inuit in a small community of 200 people, where we were one of three non-Inuit families. In this community, we didn’t have a television, computers, or even a telephone. I spent all my time outside with the Inuit, playing. The snow and ice were my sandbox, and the Inuit were my teachers. That’s where I became truly obsessed with the polar realm."
277,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"We're seen as the organization that's the bucket for failed social policy. I can't define who comes to us or how long they stay. We get people for whom nothing else has worked, individuals who have fallen through all other social safety nets. They can't contain them, so we must. That's our job: contain them, control them. Over the years, as a prison system, as a nation, and as a society, we've become very good at that, but that shouldn't make you happy. Today we incarcerate more people per capita than any other country. We have more Black men in prison today than were under slavery in 1850."
278,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"I'd like to take you on the epic quest of the Rosetta spacecraft. Escorting and landing the probe on a comet has been my passion for the past two years. To do that, I need to explain something about the origin of the solar system. Four and a half billion years ago, there was a cloud of gas and dust. In the center of this cloud, our Sun formed and ignited. Along with it, what we now know as planets, comets, and asteroids formed. According to theory, when Earth cooled down after its formation, comets massively impacted it and delivered water. They probably also delivered complex organic material, potentially bootstrapping the emergence of life."
279,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"Chris Anderson: Hello, TED community, welcome back for another live conversation. It's a significant one today, as important as they come. You know, when we created this ""Build Back Better"" series, our goal was to address issues arising from the pandemic and imagine rebuilding from that. However, the events of this past week—the horrific death of George Floyd and the daily protests that have followed—have provided a new urgency that we, of course, simply must address. I mean, can we build back better from this? I think before we can even start to answer that question, we must seek to understand the immensity of this moment. Whitney Pennington Rodgers: That's right, Chris."
280,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"In 1903, the President of the United States took a three-day camping trip in California’s Yosemite Valley. President Theodore Roosevelt slept among towering sequoia trees, camped in a snowstorm, and spent hours conversing around the campfire with his host and guide, conservationist John Muir. Roosevelt was famously passionate about the outdoors, but Muir had invited him for more than just recreation: Yosemite was under threat. Although Yosemite had become protected land in 1864, the valley still faced overdevelopment risks in 1903. It was at the center of a long-standing struggle to reserve land for both preservation and public use—two goals that were much easier said than done. The battle over Yosemite began with the 1849 Gold Rush when miners flocked west, seeking gold in the Sierra Nevada foothills."

(applause) My ambition always was to be a pilot, to fly a plane, to feel free soaring through the sky, to touch the sky. But that didn't happen. Simply, I live in Gaza; there is no airport, and all borders are closed on every side. We live in one of the biggest prisons in the world. The only thing I can do is look up at the sky. On some days, we are lucky if we have electricity for four or five hours. When it's cold, we make a fire at the front or on the roof of our homes."
282,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"I am sorry I cannot show you my face, because if I do, the bad guys will come for me. My journey started 14 years ago. I was a young reporter who had just graduated from college. Then I got a scoop. The story was simple: police officers were taking bribes from hawkers on the streets. As a young reporter, I wanted to approach it differently for maximum impact, as everyone knew it was happening, yet nothing was being done to stop it. So I decided to act as a seller. In doing so, I was able to document hard evidence. The impact was profound. It was fantastic. This approach is what many call immersion journalism or undercover journalism."
283,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"One simple vitamin can reduce your risk of heart disease. Eating chocolate reduces stress in students. A new drug prolongs the lives of patients with a rare disease. Health headlines like these are published every day, sometimes making opposite claims. There can be a disconnect between broad, attention-grabbing headlines and the often specific, incremental results of the medical research they cover. So how can you avoid being misled by grabby headlines? The best way to assess a headline’s credibility is to look at the original research it reports on. We’ve come up with a hypothetical research scenario for each of these three headlines. Keep watching for the explanation of the first example; then pause at the headline to answer the question. These are simplified scenarios."
284,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"When I was 14, my family was adopting my little brothers from Ethiopia. One day, my mom asked, ""What day should we put for their birthday?"" I replied, ""The day they were born, obviously?"" It seemed a ridiculous question. My mom then explained, ""Well, Kristen, neither of your little brothers have a birth certificate, so how do you suggest we find out when that was?"" My mind was blown. Now, 20 years later, I'm still working on it. Instead of just solving the mystery of my brothers' missing birth certificates, I aim to address this issue globally. So, what do birth certificates have to do with international development?"
285,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"Imagine if you could connect your brain to a machine offering ultimate pleasure for life. Would you choose that existence if given the chance? That's the question philosopher Robert Nozick posed through his thought experiment, the experience machine. The experiment asks us to consider a world where scientists create a machine simulating real life while guaranteeing only pleasure, never pain. The catch? You must permanently leave reality behind, though you'd barely notice the difference. Your experiences would be indistinguishable from reality. Life's natural ups and downs would be replaced with an endless series of highs. Sounds great, right?"
286,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"I would like to share the most embarrassing moment of my career as a palliative care physician. This incident occurred a couple of years ago. I was consulted to see a woman in her 70s—a retired English professor with pancreatic cancer. She was experiencing pain, nausea, and vomiting. During our discussion, she inquired if medical marijuana could help her. I relied on my medical school education, which was brief because I had learned absolutely nothing about medical marijuana."

As firefighters, my team and I are responsible for saving lives and property from disasters such as car wrecks, house fires, and life-threatening medical emergencies. I am a woman leading a department in a male-dominated profession. Ten years ago, I decided to expand my medical knowledge and obtained a nursing degree. This decision was motivated by the realization that the next major threat to my city, and others nationwide, was not a single incident where firefighters can simply rush in, extinguish the fire, and leave, feeling they have made a difference and everything is resolved."
288,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"Where does all the carbon we release go? Carbon operates in a natural cycle, present in all living things: in the soil, oceans, atmosphere, and rocks deep underground. When plants and other living things die, much of their stored carbon returns to the atmosphere until new plants grow and reabsorb it. However, over millions of years, some carbon from ancient trees and sea life becomes rock, and some becomes fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas. Natural events like volcanic eruptions release some of the carbon trapped in rock. Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, also release some of that prehistoric carbon. Today, humans release around 60 times more carbon than all the volcanoes on the planet each year."
289,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"Even nature's most unpleasant creatures harbor important secrets, but who would want a swarm of cockroaches approaching them? One of the greatest differences between natural and human technologies relates to robustness. Robust systems are stable in complex and new environments. Remarkably, cockroaches can self-stabilize while running over rough terrain. When we fit them with a jet pack or give them a perturbation like an earthquake, we discovered that their exceptionally tuned legs allow them to self-stabilize without using any brainpower. They can traverse complex terrain like grass without issue, maintaining stability. We uncovered a new behavior where, due to their shape, they roll automatically to their side to navigate this artificial patch of grass. Robust systems can perform multiple tasks with the same structure. Here's a new behavior we've discovered."

And so, I would like to cheer you up with one of the great, albeit largely unknown, commercial success stories of the past 20 years. Comparable, in its own peculiar way, to the achievements of Microsoft or Google. And it's an industry that has weathered the current recession with equanimity. I refer to organized crime. Now organized crime has been around for a long time, I hear you say, and these would be wise words indeed. But in the last two decades, it has experienced unprecedented expansion, now accounting for roughly 15 percent of the world's GDP. I like to call it the global shadow economy, or McMafia, for short. So what triggered this extraordinary growth in cross-border crime?"
291,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"When you ask people which aspect of psychology they find challenging, and mention ""thinking and emotions,"" most respond that emotions are extremely difficult. They describe emotions as incredibly complex, claiming they have no clue how they function. In contrast, they view thinking as very straightforward, often likening it to logical reasoning. However, that's not the challenging part. Here's a list of issues that arise. A notable problem is health. The other day, I read that the largest single cause of disease in the West is probably handshaking."
292,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"What is a parent? It's not an easy question. Today we have adoption, stepfamilies, and surrogate mothers. Many parents confront tough questions and decisions. Should we tell our child about the sperm donation? If so, when? What words should we use? Sperm donors are often called ""biological fathers,"" but should we use the word ""father?"" As a philosopher and social scientist, I have been studying these questions about parenthood. But today, I will share what I learned from speaking with parents and children. I will show you that they know what truly matters in a family, even if their family looks a little different."
293,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"When I look in the mirror today, I see a justice and education scholar at Columbia University, a youth mentor, an activist, and a future New York State senator. I see all of that and a man who spent a quarter of his life in state prison—six years, to be exact—starting as a teenager on Rikers Island for an act that nearly cost a man his life. But what got me from there to here wasn't the punishment I faced as a teenager in adult prison or the harshness of our legal system. Instead, it was the learning environment of a classroom that introduced me to something I didn't think was possible for me or our justice system as a whole. A few weeks before my release on parole, a counselor encouraged me to enroll in a new college course being offered in the prison."

Or just an airport security line delay. That one’s actually true. (laughter) If some of your perceptions were negative, I don’t really blame you. That's how the media has been portraying people who look like me. One study found that 80 percent of news coverage about Islam and Muslims is negative.

The first time I spoke at a conference was here at TED, eight years ago. Fresh out of grad school, little did I know that in those few minutes onstage, I was framing the questions I would be asked for the next decade. Like many 20-somethings, I expected to solve the world's problems—more specifically, the world's water problems—with my technology. I had much to learn. It was seductive, believing that our biggest water quality problems persist because they're hard to identify. I presumed that we just needed simpler, faster, and more affordable sensors. I was wrong."

I was familiar with all topics, including ecology and apocalyptic predictions, but admittedly didn't fully believe in them. Then, in 2007, the unprecedented subprime crisis struck, bringing down major American banks. It was a wake-up call. I had numerous intense discussions with my wife about my job and the limitations of the financial model. Aside from the crisis, I realized just how mistaken I had been and recognized that we were heading toward disaster."

What I’m doing right now is making sounds with my mouth as I exhale. I’m producing tones, hisses, and puffs, creating vibrations in the air. These vibrations travel to you, hit your eardrums, and your brain transforms them into thoughts. I hope that’s happening. So, thanks to this ability, we can transmit ideas across vast reaches of space and time. We’re able to share knowledge across minds."

Additionally, what an honor it is, as a politician, to give a TED talk, especially here in the U.K., where the reputation of politics, with the expenses scandal, has sunk so low. There was even a story recently that scientists considered replacing rats in their experiments with politicians. And someone asked, ""Why?"" They said, ""Well, there's no shortage of politicians, no one really minds what happens to them, and there are some things that rats just won't do.""
