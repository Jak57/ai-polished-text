1,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Another week has flown by me. I drove by the new house yesterday and the front window was covered in boxes. We may get the keys at closing, I'm getting increasingly excited. If all goes well this week, we will be set for closing a week from Wednesday. I was up until after 3 00am last night watching movies with Bethany. There has been a lot of movie-watching going on around here lately. Here's my rundown  last night, we watched thirteen, a movie every mother of a teenager should see. It was better than I expected. Then, we watched Gigli, yeah, it was just as bad as the media said it was, but we had to see for ourselves."
2,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Summer television used to be a barren landscape of reruns, but now there are two exceptional new shows that have captivated my attention. I've been watching both obsessively for the past week. One show stands out for its audacious concept, despite having no apparent LGBTQ+ representation. Hairstylist Jonathan Antin aims to expand his successful West Hollywood salon to Beverly Hills, but it's his bombastic declaration that caught my attention. While flipping through channels, I stumbled upon Jonathan, looking equally self-absorbed and uninspired, standing in an empty space on Rodeo Drive, proclaiming in a public voice, 'I'm going to build here the greatest salon in the history of the world!' I was hooked. Not since Rocco have I found a character so infuriatingly fascinating to watch."
3,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"What a week has been a challenging one for me. My right shoulder has been plagued by tendonitis, situated right under my shoulder blade. As a result, when I move my arm excessively, especially when using a mouse on a computer, it becomes excruciating. I've been on a marathon of updating my website and working on other online tasks, which has left me with little strength to lift a pencil. The lack of sleep has only added to my discomfort. I'm not feeling particularly well at the moment, but I'm hoping to improve soon. My mom's surgery went smoothly, and her eyesight has shown some improvement. She can now make out fuzzy shapes and distinguish basic colors. Although she still struggles with her vision, I'm optimistic that she'll regain her sight fully soon."
4,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"I had a remarkable experience doing laundry with the kids today. As I navigated the process, I was struck by how quickly even the simplest tasks can become a daunting ordeal. I also discovered that strangers can be incredibly kind and sweet, often simply because they feel like being kind. I didn't feel like they were trying to gain something from me; it was a genuine act of kindness. To make matters worse, I was covered in kid's drool and was wearing my 'wash-day' outfit. Additionally, I'm not sure I'll ever be able to bathe again, so there wasn't even an olfactory incentive there! As I'm doing two things at the moment, I'm composing this post and watching a collection of videos. I'm accomplishing both tasks from the comfort of my room, seated at my desk."
5,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"It's 11 14 pm MST, and I'm currently sitting in my bedroom, fixing the personal computer of my job's personnel director. While I don't mind doing it, I often find myself wondering when the line is crossed from being helpful to being taken advantage of. I'm grateful to be able to use my skills to assist others, but I've been staying up late reading lately, so I was looking forward to an early night, until I realized it would be more practical to get the computer back to its owner. No rest for the weary, indeed! As I finished the task, I found myself watching Joe Schmo 2 again tonight."
6,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Remind me, what did I write about before this? Or, a continuation in the 'Is This a Date?' saga, so, after the unusual lunch, my confidence wavered, I forgot to share an important piece of the story. Before Pat shows up to lunch, Dustin starts talking about what a nice guy Pat is and how he's trying to find a girlfriend for him. I'm listening and nodding, realizing that we're discussing more about finding Dustin's best friend a girl than discussing whatever it is you discuss with a stranger over pink lemonade. I excused myself to the bathroom, looked in the mirror, and then silently asked myself  Am I being pawned off to the other guy? Is this what happens now?"
7,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"I would like everyone to take a moment to think before acting. I'd like each and every individual in the world to take a moment to reflect before getting out of bed in the morning, and make a commitment to think critically throughout the day. If they're not prepared to do so, I'd like it if they would simply go back to bed and rest. I'm frustrated with the lack of thoughtful decision-making. I'm not the most intelligent person, but I'm not referring to complex, intellectually demanding issues. I believe it's reasonable to hold people accountable for their thoughtless actions. Let's focus on a few specific examples today, and we'll save more complex issues for another time, sound good?"
8,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Two issues with the scenario outlined in my previous post  1. True, the Bush administration's stimulus efforts are stimulating the economy, but in the wrong way. Robert Rubin, in a recent interview on NPR's Marketplace, stated that the same stimulus effect could have been achieved without the long-term debt hangover by implementing different tax cuts, temporary tax cuts that would benefit low- and middle-income individuals. Ah, Robert Rubin, whose name is music to our ears. Quickly, can you name a Bush administration cabinet official on the domestic side with Rubin's gravitas? Still thinking... it'll come to you... 2. We can't give the Republicans control only in wartime because they've ingeniously concocted an endless, global 'war on terrorism.'"

We went to the cove to see Supernothing, and they were great as usual. I got to chill with Tiago. Saturday. I went to work, then out with Joe and Rach, met up with Steve, Tiago, and Tom. I came home around quarter to 12 and woke up the next morning at quarter to 7 for a meet. I arrived a bit late, but it's all good - I did my full-on floor and didn't fall, second on floor and vault, and third on beam, with a score of 29.45, which isn't bad because my meets get better as the season goes on."
10,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Do you ever have one of those moments when you begin to reflect on life? Like when you're sitting in math class, feeling bored out of your skull, and wondering what exactly goes on in your brain that makes you understand math? And then you realize that you exist and you're in math class, and you wonder why. Suddenly, it hits you  the fact that you're going off on this random train of thought is incredibly pathetic. Have you ever had that happen? I hate that. You know what else I hate? Block schedules. Who would ever come up with that idea? Anyone can see that sitting through a two-and-a-half-hour class in any subject is cruel and an unusual punishment."
11,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"I've come to the realization that my monopoly phase has run its course, and I'm vowing to never lay my hands on that iron again - not the hot one, but the game piece. Tonight, Andy beat me by a few small dollars and won the Farqu game, possibly because I let him win on account of him leaving in a few short hours and me wanting him to feel good on his last night here. Regardless of how the story goes, it can't compare to this Texas-sized headache I have at the moment. I've taken some Aleve and must say they're doing the trick; all I need now is some well-deserved rest and relaxation. Your phone's the one that helped me wrap the cord around your neck... at the drive-in."
12,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Well, today has been a long day. We drove home from Indiana. I suppose I'll have to be selective about what I write about, as I could easily take up a significant amount of time and space, and I'm just not feeling energetic enough. First, I must say that camp was truly awesome and even better than I could have expected. God has been doing so much in my life lately, and it's just amazing. I've sort of turned over a new leaf, but I'm back to the beginning. We arrived at the Twiggs' house on Friday evening and stayed until we left for camp on Monday. Most of what we did was visit the fair, attend church, watch a parade, go to Walmart, and watch movies."
13,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Today is my last day of summer vacation! I'm excited but also a bit anxious, as I have a dentist appointment at 9 am. I'd rather get it over with now rather than trying to schedule it during the first month of my surgery rotation. I'm definitely feeling nervous, scared, and jittery about the thought of it. As a perfectionist, I thrive on excelling at everything I do. However, starting new things can be challenging. I dislike being a pawn and not knowing what's going on, as I told Cassie, 'I'm going to be the only pawn on the chessboard who insists on moving like a knight.' This is going to be a whole new ball game for me."
14,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Arun Shourie discusses how, as early as 1996, the then-governor of Uttar Pradesh warned about the looming threat of a 'third Islamic state' emerging in the subcontinent. T.V. Rajeswar, the former head of the Intelligence Bureau and current governor of Uttar Pradesh, had previously predicted this dire threat in a series of articles published in the Hindustan Times. Shourie raises a pertinent question when he asks, does the fact that T.V. Rajeswar, rather than himself or Mr. Advani, penned these warnings make them more credible? Or do you conclude that Rajeswar's consistent warnings suggest he is a closet communalist and unfit to continue as governor of Uttar Pradesh?"
15,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Attitude  indifferent, mood  bored. I'm looking forward to tonight after a long, hard day in the trenches. I barely had any time to write anything for you readers, but I'm glad to see Tigger taking over the reins and making an appearance. She's talking about things, and I don't have much to say about them. Yesterday, I attended a production of Shakespeare on the green, which was a lovely play, but I had to leave before the closing curtain, which was a bit disappointing. However, I hope to see the entire play someday. I digress. Akcron is correct about the problems with the shower - it's just that it's hard not to laugh at myself in the shower, and the looks people get when they're committing self-torture can be quite entertaining."
16,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"For the past two days, I've been overwhelmed with debilitating exhaustion, feeling utterly drained. Last evening, I went home and collapsed into a deep sleep, only rousing myself when my mother called me around 8 30 PM. Upon waking, I found myself in a darkened room, struggling to discern the time or date. For a few disoriented seconds, it was just my mother's voice in the darkness and my futile attempts to grasp reality. I find myself wondering why I'm feeling so fatigued... The weather outside is quite pleasant today, with a gentle drizzle falling from the sky. Although, I'm told it's been raining nonstop for the past three days in Calcutta."
17,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Last night was a disappointing evening. I had to abandon the sweater I was knitting, as I had only about 14 inches completed. Unfortunately, I lost around $10 worth of yarn (it's $8 per skein), as it had developed too many stitches by the time I reached the armholes and the mohair was knotting itself together as I knitted, making frogging (ripping out rows) ineffective. The yarn broke a significant amount. I didn't even swear, which is unusual for me. I simply ripped it apart and spent the evening watching season two of Sex and the City (a great way to unwind, actually!). Eventually, I grew tired of it and discarded the project. I suppose I did learn a thing or two from the experience."
18,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Last night in class, we discussed the assigned reading for the week, specifically Edward S. Casey's ""Getting Back into Place  Toward a Renewed Sense of the World"". The first chapter, ""Implacement"", and the second, ""Displacement"", caught my attention. In the first chapter, Casey argues that our contemporary world and culture revolve around time as the situating force  we're running out of time, we've saved time, and we're just in time. He makes the case that using place as the center of culture provides a more grounded community. So far, this book is the first reading that has truly captivated me."
19,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Whatever they put into freeze pops to create their vibrant colors, there must be some sort of warning  it may make your life a bit surreal. And while giggling is enjoyable, one wonders if we would have found ourselves stumbling upon that fire escape, drinking beer in the fierce wind, had we not been snacking on them earlier. Finding ourselves in a doorway to a bar sadly closed for business, we stopped to flip through an office-supplies catalogue that had arrived in the mail. Lucky we did. Who could possibly have anticipated that within these pages were the special deals of a lifetime? Not I, for certain. I'll list a few  buy 36 permanent marker pens, get a stunt kite. Buy 30 lever-arch files, get a barbecue."
20,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"I'm currently listening to 'The Little Drummer Boy' by Stevan Pasero. Meanwhile, I have a post about the recent 39-hour Senate session, where Republicans dominated the judicial nominations. I must admit, I didn't watch the entire ordeal, but I did tune in a couple of times. The entire exercise was a colossal waste of time, orchestrated by Republicans who were upset that Democrats wouldn't rubber-stamp four of President Bush's controversial judicial nominees, allowing them to score political points by prolonging the process. It's worth noting that Democrats have already confirmed 168 of Bush's judicial nominees, but that wasn't good enough for the power-hungry Republicans, who seem to believe they have a mandate for this kind of political grandstanding."
21,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"This weekend was a good one. After a long time, I spent a lot of time outdoors, indulging in some much-needed greenery. Additionally, I made time to listen to a lot of music, something I should have started doing sooner. I also read a lot, finishing three books over the weekend  Bruce Sterling's 'Heavy Weather', Larry Niven's 'World of Ptavvs', and Octavia Butler's 'Parable of the Sower'. 'Heavy Weather' was a thrilling cyberpunk romp through a near-future USA, ravaged by global warming and anarchy. While it was cleverly written, well-paced, and altogether very convincing, I must admit that I didn't come away with any truly profound insights about the story or characters. Not that they aren't well-crafted and vividly portrayed - it's a good book, but not a great one, in my opinion."
22,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"The aftermath of the first week back from practicum was a struggle, but it wasn't until the second week that the smoke began to clear. Post-practicum trauma was a hidden epidemic that is only now coming to light. I was struck, but the eventual meeting with the course coordinator allowed me to release my burden, and in doing so, I prevented another student from being stuck with a pedagogically deficient practicum experience. Yesterday, on Monday, I ran into another agitated classmate who was determined to warn the student who was about to embark on the next practicum, and I calmed her down, suggesting that we should first approach the administrator."
23,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Well, things have been incredibly busy around here, but there's always time for stress-relieving activities. I've found that I'm not exactly a pro at 8-ball and ping pong! Rick, also known as the Canuck, consistently beats me in regular matches - we have a ping pong table in the front lobby of our building, always available for a quick game. Last night, I participated in an 8-ball tournament at the hot spot, our recreation tent, which is equipped with a popcorn machine, multiple TVs, a jukebox, DVD rentals, a pool table, dartboard, and, of course, the ever-present ping pong table. I was doing quite well throughout my one entire game until I scratched on the eight ball, unfortunately. Despite that, I still had a great time - the most enjoyable part was when two Dutch soldiers joined the tournament."
24,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Fall 1974  I was attempting, for what felt like the 13th time, to push through the second chapter of my high school algebra book. As I'm not a math person, I hate math; I'm math-phobic. You get the picture. As I struggled to make sense of algebra, the doorbell rang. I put down my book and went to answer it. No one was there. Great. I returned to my studies and, just as I was finding a glimmer of understanding buried in my subconscious, the doorbell rang again. Bam, just like that my breakthrough disappeared. I went to the door and, once again, no one was there. Just what a struggling math student needs, an uninvited practical joker."
25,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"This past week has been nothing short of exhausting. I spent Tuesday to Thursday finishing the move to my new classroom. The new room is bigger and closer to my grade-level team, which are the things I need to consider as I spend hours upon hours preparing my room for this year. Had I known I was going to move prior to the end of my school year, I would have discarded much of the books and supplies I no longer use. Unfortunately, it all came with me. So this week was spent moving, unpacking, and purging profusely. I have to thank my teammate, Jill, for helping with all of this. She was still teaching this month in my old room, so she and her lovely students moved almost my entire room for me."

Even if I never bore you a child, even if I was never married to you, even if I was never officially bound to you... I loved you immensely, and to this day, the feeling still resonates within my heart. Forever, I will always be reminded of the few precious nights we spent together, our hearts and limbs intertwined in a soulful embrace, bathed in the salty darkness of an evening by the beach... or a kiss under the rain. Whenever I feel the sensation of a dark glass piercing my heart, you will be there. That piece of you... the eternal love that once resided within me... and still lingers. For her."
27,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"I'm uncomfortable with investigative reporting. The concept seems quite unsettling to me. Or, I'll rephrase it - the article I'm working on and its consequences aren't exactly something I'm comfortable with. Perhaps it's because I don't believe in it strongly enough, so I can't quite grasp the full extent of it. The underlying passion behind it. The full-fledged commitment towards it to question. I've grown up in a country where you're not encouraged to ask questions. In fact, you're often discouraged from doing so. They can even put you in jail for asking questions, citing internal security measures. I'm not accustomed to this freedom of speech, nor am I used to speaking out loud. I'm not the most natural person to voice my opinions freely."
28,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"We had an outing yesterday with my colleagues from the bank. We ventured to Guintubdan, La Carlota, a destination many of us had never visited before. The trek to the falls was a 30-minute walk, and we were all panting by the end of it. Whew! But we persevered and made it to the falls. The water was icy cold, and the chill was palpable, making our bodies feel numb. We stayed for less than an hour before heading to the nearby waterfalls, which required another 30-minute trek. Despite the challenges, the trip was well worth it, as the falls were calming and the scenery was breathtaking. It was as if we could hear ourselves harmonizing with nature. Soaking in the cold water felt like a form of communion with Mother Earth. The combination of cold air and water was almost soporific, making us feel lulled to sleep."

With a month left before Ed leaves, I think it's starting to sink in with Ed and all of us. I think it sank in with me a long time ago. I just hope Ed will be here for Bailey's surgery.

Thankfully, I had brought a bag of eggs with us, just in case. Connor had a great time searching for eggs in the park. On Sunday morning, when he woke up, he was thrilled that the Easter bunny had visited. There's nothing quite like seeing the excitement on a child's face. After egg hunting, we attended church, even though the Easter bunny is a fun and festive part of the holiday. We make sure our kids understand the true meaning behind the holidays. This was Megan's first Easter, and she looked adorable in her jean dress and stockings."

Parents often think they know us too well, to the point where they can read our emotions from our facial expressions. But they don't truly know us. And when I go upstairs after arguing with Nicole about Kelli, as I just did a few minutes ago, and they ask me to tell them what's wrong. Yes, how about you let me handle it?

Nothing like 48 hours of daydreaming to get one's creative energy back. I have it good for a foreigner, and my timing was good, too. The illustration part is the icing on the cake. I'd probably complain more if that didn't fall in my lap. I know I am getting ripped off, though. I'm not blind to that fact. Getting hungry.

However, since I started it, I suppose I'd better say something. Firstly, I think the idea of having a law against flag-burning is completely misguided. The moment you accord automatic reverence and protection to any symbol, you've taken a small but significant step towards totalitarianism. Symbols are fickle - they don't inherently represent anything in themselves; it's what they are perceived as meaning or made to represent that's important."

However, I believe too much energy was devoted to the set, which was magnificent, and not enough on creating a solidifying tone, theme, and so on. The retelling of the story was not particularly engaging, and I don't feel like I gained anything from watching it. The character development was somewhat weak. Additionally, I thought the score was poor, and it was essentially a copy of Gladiator, which used the background music of a wailing woman to great effect because it added depth and complemented a genuinely gripping narrative."

The company allows services to sell unit contingent energy as an hourly firm, since BPA is supplying reserves for up to 60 minutes. If Grays Harbor Paper notifies RT of a unit derate or outage, RT should notify BPA dispatch immediately and make the reduction in the schedule during the next ramp. For example, if Grays unit trips as 1333 RT would notify BPA and sink that across the top of the hour for 1400, the schedule would be taken to zero for he 1400.

95,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,email_content,"I entered volume and pricing on the following two deals in Siteira; deal 418015 CNG citygate with Tenn Prod plus transport pricing. Deal 418065 CGas citygate with TRCO and CGLF production pricing and TRCO, CGLF, and CGas transport pricing (this will take a while to do). Do we want to turn the auto-confirms off? I think every time I create a VNG deal, a confirm is faxed to them. And if anyone has a better way of doing the deals (should we show these as production area sales), please let me know. The easiest way I can come up with is to enter the sales at the citygate or storage facility and have most of the pricing done in a worksheet."
96,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"It puts the ball in the net or it gets the hose again. Absolutely amazing, I have nothing negative to say about this game as it exceeds my expectations and will probably exceed yours too. The fluid movement, bug-free, and lots of story/content to put you through options for each and every day, such as multiple practices, events, and even games. This review is based on playing my career, and so far, it's 10/10. The Facescan worked really well for me (I used it twice, the first one made me have a downward-facing forehead, though). Keep in mind that using the My NBA 2K17 app will allow you to Facescan for free and earn daily VC. #Sellout."
97,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"Magic fans, beware... Wizards are hesitant to create a decent digital game. At its core, the gathering is a social game. A game to enjoy with friends (or frenemies) laughing, talking smack, and dropping game-winning bombs. The wizards of the coast seem to have forgotten this. If you choose to play with friends, you can earn gold, and gold is crucial. Gold is so important that they have implemented a daily cap, understandably considering gold unlocks everything in the game. But get ready for a long and tedious 1v1 grind against the computer or random opponents, whom you can't even communicate with. If you choose to play for free, it will take you roughly 4 hours a day for upwards of a month, by yourself, to unlock the cards."
98,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"I'll tackle the unpleasant aspects first in the third installment of the trilogy. I strongly dislike pre-quals as they take the story backward, rather than forward (this is a problem common to all pre-quals). While they do provide more story, the combat feels sloppy and lacks the sharpness that Arkham City managed to achieve. As of my writing this review (October 26, 2013), there is a game-breaking bug that prevents a side mission from ever being completed (the main story remains unaffected). Some gadgets are placed at an inconvenient hotkey that requires a lengthy keyboard journey to access, which may seem minor, but in combat, it could potentially disrupt your combos."
99,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"They have effectively resolved the Shadow Warrior (2013) issue, i.e., the boss fights are impressive, weapons feel very nice (albeit not as exceptional as D44M's, but still solid), enemies aren't too spongy (if you're not too reckless with handling elemental and upgrade items). The upgrade system is well-balanced and once you master it, it's not overly tedious. The elemental elements and limited ammo encourage you to use a variety of weapons. Many unique, or rather, cool weapons that remain viable throughout most of the game. The music is excellent, particularly the main theme and, of course, Stan Bush's work."
100,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"So many things went wrong. I'm having trouble starting this review, as it's all related to my career. My player is an outside scorer, PG, 1.71m, with maxed stats and all necessary perks. Okay, and now I'd like to know, why the shooting skill depends on a person's height. Why a person with 1.74m can't become as good in shooting as someone with 1.71m? As an 1.87m player in RL, I created my first player with this height and noticed that I couldn't reach a higher skill than 89. Why is that a clear discrimination? And why the game doesn't inform me of this before I create a character, and not even then when I reach the skill limit after weeks of playing?"
101,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"I think this assassin's creed nailed the mechanics on all fronts, from ship battles to sailing, hunting, parkour, and more. I felt a strong attachment to this character as well. The story starts out rough, but it gets much better as you play. Edward was an interesting character, and so were all the side characters. I felt that all the collectibles actually had a purpose in this game, which I never got from any of the previous ones. Perhaps it's because I felt like they had a bigger role in the game. They were not required, but they were fun to get and you got rewarded in a well-balanced way."
102,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"While I personally cannot recommend this game, it wasn't absolutely terrible. The gunplay is alright, as long as you have the budget to purchase gun parts, which would be my main concern with this game  it's pay-to-win. If I could look past that, the game would be enjoyable, as the hard suit is fun to use and HRV is an excellent idea. I'd take this game over any Call of Duty title any day, but its pay-to-win microtransaction format is off-putting for me. If you're alright with this model, then by all means, have fun. But if you're like me and dislike pay-to-win games, just let this one slide; it's not our cup of tea."
103,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"While not perfect, this game has been a thoroughly enjoyable experience. The save system and possibility of sudden death can lead to some frustration. I'm currently on my first playthrough and I lost my main character around hour 10 of the 20-hour mark. I would have greatly appreciated the ability to reload at that point. I've since acquired a third-party mod/save tool to avoid catastrophic failures. Additionally, the aiming reticle is a bit small and the zoom could be more powerful. With all that said, it's been a blast. I'm not typically a fan of zombies, but the combination of strategy, missions, and first-person shooter/beat 'em up is a great combination. I've been playing it as often as I can get away... Just one more mission, just one more supply run - or I'm running away and want to get to a safe location before shutting the game down."
104,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"This game is an absolute great strategy game! Having played every single other war game (European Escalation and Albion), I have to say this one fits well. The number of units is great. Not sure exactly how many units there are, but there's a vast amount. The graphics are just beautiful, the sounds are great, and the gameplay overall is epic. The in-game chat box at the main menu is very entertaining, I'm not kidding. However, if you think this game is 'easy', or if you're new to the strategy genre, it could take you some time to get it down. Don't get discouraged, you'll lose a lot of units. Just make sure you plan ahead, always have anti-air, and anti-tank."
105,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"I was initially skeptical about this game before I played it. I wasn't even sure about buying it, as the whole portal gun and portals concept seemed unusual to me, even though I enjoy science fiction. I was wrong. The humor and voice acting in this game are phenomenal. They're not cheesy, although it's occasionally cheesy. Each of the story's characters has their own distinct sense of humor. The different characters truly have distinct personalities. The level design is just fantastic. By the way, I never played the first Portal game. One of these days, I'm planning to play it if I can spare the time. I wouldn't have played it if I hadn't played the sequel."
107,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"Yes, this is a nostalgia trip for thirty-somethings who remember watching the ever-irksome Timmy Mallet for the five-minute Transformers cartoon. The voice actors for Optimus, Megatron, Bumblebee, and many others are back, and instantly recognizable. The distinctive cartoon transformation sound effects are there. Graphically, the cell-shaded presentation is perfect, and very, very Generation One. But aside from that, it's actually a very fun game. The combat mechanics are extremely well-done. Transforming mid-fight is often a necessity, and seamlessly woven into combos, making it quite unlike the excellent War for Cybertron games. Another distinction is the heavy focus on melee combat, but some enemies (e.g., Seekers) require a switch to a ranged blaster."
108,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"I downloaded the game and played it for a bit, but it was underwhelming. I spent more time trying to log in than actually playing the game. There's a bug where it prompts you to update the terms of service, but clicking 'accept' doesn't work, so you have to restart the client. That's not ideal, but what I find concerning is that I'm forced to link my Steam and GFACE accounts. They claim it's for DLC, but I'm not sure why that's necessary, especially since it's not reversible. Now I know that a company I don't care about has access to my Steam information. The game itself is somewhat disappointing. It's easily recognizable as a Call of Duty clone, but somehow they managed to make the gunplay worse. It's hard to fathom how they achieved that."
109,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"4K+ at 60fps (GTX 970) and dual audio options, along with Neptune Gear, make for a fantastic experience. What's not to love? (Check out the excellent port in this YouTube video  https //www.youtube.com/watch?v=nygsb617tmo.) This game is a great entry point for newcomers to the series. Keep in mind that there is some (skippable) dialogue. As usual, I recommend using a gamepad, but I had no issues with a keyboard-mouse setup, which is fully rebindable. The price is reasonable, and I wouldn't have been disappointed with a purchase. Plus, more than half the DLC is included for free, providing plenty to play with. I highly recommend this game to JRPG, anime, and visual novel fans, as long as you're comfortable with occasional breaks between action sequences. Cheers. (No commentary playlist available here  https //www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plslfvijaupszez9af395mvnk63xnhsj1.)"
110,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"I experienced no performance issues at release, and after all these patches, the game plays really well. In my opinion, this is a truly great and fun game, although the format may be somewhat annoying (where the free-roam city area repopulates with new enemies every time you progress the story). I particularly enjoyed the 'dual play' segments, where you can play Batman alongside one more character, and the ability to use the controller for most parts of the game, but the mouse and keyboard for the tank combat segments was greatly appreciated. Driving the Batmobile around the free-roam city, including when chasing the APC commanders, is actually quite enjoyable once you master the art of using the breaks to skid around corners, and when you master that, driving around the city is really quite enjoyable."
111,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"Overall, the game is a fantastic FPS shooter. The graphics, sound, and gameplay are all top-notch - great mechanics, engaging story, memorable characters, and a fantastic voice acting, along with a killer soundtrack. However, it's not for the faint of heart, as some of the cutscenes can be quite graphic and intense. Despite this, it's hard to overlook the flaws when the game is this good, and I noticed a few issues  no SLI support, which made the game run poorly on my old dual-GPU GTX 590. Make sure to have a decent single-GPU card to play this game smoothly."
112,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"Although English is not my native language, I'm Dutch, so please bear with any minor typing or grammatical mistakes in my review of this fantastic game. I will break down this review into several categories  graphics, controls, sound, and replayability. Graphics  the game features a comic-like style, with very slick and detailed visuals. The graphics can be set to 'high' without putting a strain on your system. I run this game on an i5 Pentium processor with an NVIDIA GeForce 710M card, 8GB of memory, and Windows 8.1, and it runs smoothly. Controls  the game can be played with a keyboard and mouse, but it's also compatible with an Xbox controller."
114,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"I'm two hours into this game and I'm dying from laughter. The gameplay is solid, the art design is beautiful, the music is surprisingly high-quality and fitting, and the story/world has me hooked. But the best part about this game is the comedy. If you've played any RPGs since the dawn of video game RPGs, you'll laugh at the various jokes, parodies, and references; if you've never played an RPG before, you'll still enjoy the game for its humor. If you played Final Fantasy 7 or X, you absolutely need to play this game, without giving away too much... I had to stop playing after two hours to give my cheeks a break from laughing and smiling so much. What a delight so far."
115,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"I'm truly sorry to say, but I tried to be supportive of free-to-play games and indie developers, but I didn't really enjoy this game. The description sounded right up my alley, but the execution fell short of my expectations. I love puzzle and exploration games, but I found this game to be completely unintuitive, and even after looking up how to progress, I still didn't find the gameplay itself enjoyable. It also lacks a pause button, or if it does have one, I never found it. Considering that a lot of sequences in the game are timed, this seems like a critical oversight. I also feel like this game is a lot more cutscene than it is game, and I end up just sitting around drumming my fingers a lot."
116,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"This game was an absolute delight from start to finish. It was a truly captivating experience, from the story to the graphics, I was completely hooked. The story wasn't just a narrative, but it felt like I was the protagonist, trying to figure out what came next in the story that my character was sharing. Gameplay was excellent, and I learned a lot about myself through this game (mainly about my fear of heights, which I never had a problem with until the ice caverns). My stomach churned the whole time, but I persisted for Uncle Fred! If you guys were to create a DLC or sequel, I would be the first to buy it and recommend it to everyone I know. Thank you to everyone involved in making this, you created an absolutely beautiful game."
117,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"Sid Meier's Civilization Beyond Earth is a turn-based game where you build your civilization to a certain goal or 'victory'. In previous games, you were set on the Earth's timeline, progressing through eras like the Stone Age, Medieval Age, and the Modern Age. In this game, you're set in the future, on a mission to colonize a new planet. What I enjoy about this game is that it took a new approach to the game, introducing mechanics such as the Affinity System and Orbital Layer. However, I didn't find it enjoyable that the new mechanics sometimes made the game overwhelming. To improve this game, I think they could incorporate some new artwork, such as the environment you experience when communicating with another leader."
118,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"This game is a great experience, offering tons of replayability and immense fun as a zombie survival game. In my top five zombie games ever played, I can honestly say that this is one of the better, more realistic zombie games I've ever played. It's very much designed like a survival horror, as you must conserve your ammo, heal your own wounds when you're injured, take medication when you're infected, and so on. Additionally, I find the zombies to be very naturally animated, making them feel like a free-to-play game. I recommend playing with one or two friends, as the community is super friendly, and you can usually make friends or communicate with others in the chat or voice chat."
119,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"Unfortunately, I cannot thoroughly recommend or enjoy this game due to the short time I've played it, as I know I would be addicted if it didn't have the following two game-breaking issues. Firstly, the lack of Australian servers puts players at a severe disadvantage, causing unbearable lag. Moreover, the offline training mode stuttered and lagged as well, which is astonishing. Additionally, the poor ping and lag ruin the game. Furthermore, the game's assets, such as the menus, backgrounds, and in-game graphics, are buggy and erratic. I've never experienced this level of lag with this graphics card before, and I thought it might not be compatible with my overclocked settings. However, setting my GPU back to stock settings did not resolve the issue."
120,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"I recently completed the game, finishing it late last night. Although the story may not be particularly deep or captivating, the narrative shines through its engaging storytelling. The atmosphere is rich and immersive, with the many collectibles doing an excellent job of fleshing it out. I learned a lot about the world of Batman, which was a bit disappointing given the scarcity of boss battles. However, there are certainly more games in the future that will rectify this. The combat is moderately challenging, but leans towards the easier side. Leveling up Batman wasn't particularly satisfying, but the gadgets and upgrades you acquire during the campaign add a pleasant new layer of gameplay mechanics. Gaining access to previously inaccessible areas creates a sense of accomplishment and progression."
121,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"To the moon is no mere game; nay, it's a veritable experience, and it was one of the best of my life at that. Telltale's The Walking Dead is sad? Ho ho ho! Well, it's no match for a trip to the moon! Never before have I been so depressed yet fulfilled over something purely fictional. This masterpiece represents the pinnacle of storytelling in my opinion, and the soundtrack is a gorgeously charming and perfect accompaniment. Yes, the controls are a bit finicky, and the gameplay is not the strong point, but the story is so fantastic that I did not care one bit. Plus, the humor is great, and it definitely doesn't intrude upon the distinguished nature of the story. And the references to the doctor are endless."
122,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"Bastion is a bloody brilliant game, boasting a rich and engaging storyline. Following a catastrophic event, you begin to rebuild within the bastion. The game offers a vast array of choices, allowing you to select the perfect combination of buildings, weapons, and power-ups to give you a strategic advantage. The art style and music in the game are both fantastic, creating a visually stunning experience that brings the apocalypse to life. Moreover, the game features a dynamic narration system, which responds to your actions in real-time. For instance, if you pick up a weapon and then switch to another in the armory, the narration will acknowledge your decision and adapt accordingly."
123,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"I initially purchased this game during its early development phase, when the primary currency was spacebux and the tech tree was not yet established. At that time, the game was still in its early stages, and all the weapons were equally overpowered, which eliminated any balance issues; anyone could take out anyone at any moment. Additionally, the game used to provide unlimited gun slots and five loadouts. You might expect that a game with an extensive arsenal of 'bajillions of guns' would offer more than six weapon slots and three loadouts before requiring additional purchases. In reality, I had around three pages worth of guns and was planning on exploring more ideas for future additions, as I found the game's gunplay to be a significant source of enjoyment."
124,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"This game was a delightful surprise. I often come across rave reviews of certain products that are often misleading. In this case, the reviews reflect the fun of this charming little game. It's an intriguing blend between a classic 2D platformer and a MOBA, and it pulls it off with style. I found myself enjoying characters that I wouldn't typically enjoy in other MOBA games. I had expected this trait to continue, but decided to give a melee tank a try anyway. I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome and ended up trying out more as they were unlocked from playing games. The art style and interface is quaintly charming. As such, I now use one of the characters as my avatar and a wallpaper from creating a card set for the game."
125,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"I've just started playing, and I'm thoroughly enthralled by this game. I put on my headphones and become completely absorbed in the game for hours at a time. It's been a while since a game has had this level of impact on me. The music perfectly sets the mood, the sound effects are spot-on, and the controls are seamless. I eagerly anticipate every combat, and they've expertly optimized the combat to an extremely high level. I initially had doubts about the naval combat system, but it's surprisingly enjoyable to unleash destruction on multiple fleets at once! The only way to lose in this game is to fail to retreat. If the combat appears overwhelming, simply regroup, and counter-attack. Thank you to the developers for crafting an incredible gaming experience!"
126,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"The reboot of the Devil May Cry franchise has brought about many changes for the series, particularly for its protagonist, Dante. While fans of the original series may be upset at the change to their beloved character, it's certainly for the better; and this new game by Ninja Theory proves it. The game serves as the perfect point for newcomers to jump into the series. It shows the origins of an arrogant, cynical Dante, and it chronicles his journey from cynicism to selflessness. Throughout, the game weaves a clear, narrative arc for the new Dante, making him a compelling character to watch. The story follows Dante as he's introduced into the corrupt world he willfully chose to ignore."
127,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"Where do I start on this absolutely captivating game? Its story is absolutely charming, with a wealth of detail woven throughout. It's a bundle of joy, bad puns, and endearing characters, including annoying dogs and hidden secrets. While it tackles serious themes, it's not afraid to inject humor and lighthearted moments. The character design is spot on, with a diverse cast of characters each with their own distinct personalities and secrets. One of the standout features is the absence of combat, which sets it apart from other RPGs. Drawing inspiration from Earthbound, one of the best RPGs I've seen, it's clear that this game is going to be exceptional. The soundtrack is also one of the most memorable I've ever heard, and it's easy to see why."
128,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"I'm recommending this game solely because it's free, and it might provide a more enjoyable experience for others. As for my experience, the game didn't resonate with me. Half the story relies heavily on shock value. I wasn't shocked or emotionally moved in any way by this. Perhaps I'm desensitized, or maybe it was too simplistic to evoke a reaction from me. The other half of the game attempts to paint a vivid picture of a person's mental decline. It explores themes such as obsession, hallucinations, depression, and a few other issues. In theory, it's an intriguing concept. However, the game took me 10 minutes to complete, and that's with reading and digesting every piece of information I could absorb."
129,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"Do I even need to explain why Portal is amazing? Portal is a puzzle game that presents a concept and then gets out of your way. It's an engaging way to test your mind while still being fun. Although this game may not be as story-heavy as others, it gave birth to one of the most popular games of 2011. I still play this game when I'm feeling bored, and I love to come back and see what gave rise to a legend and what is a legend. Gameplay  Portal's gameplay is relatively simple, to explain at least. You use portals to your advantage, along with buttons that activate a part of the puzzle. Two buttons are in the game, one that you press and one that you need a cube to place on."
130,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"If you can overlook the minor bugs, which I personally only encountered two  one minor and the other quite annoying, the edit resolved both issues, resulting in a significant increase in my FPS from 60-90 to 80-120. If you're looking for a space exploration game, I can definitely recommend this. Since most of these reviews focus on specs, I'll include mine  i5-6600K, Radeon RX480 (~200€), Z170 Pro - Gaming (~150€), 16GB DDR4 RAM (~70€), and a total cost of ~650€, which is well within the medium price range. While this rig is relatively new, I can confidently say that I experienced almost constant 60+ FPS on high settings with vsync enabled, which is impressive, considering 90% of the comments claim to be rocking an overkill setup and only achieving 20 FPS."
131,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"Remember the age of mythology? Indeed, it's been a while since there's been an RTS game of such high quality. Divinity  Dragon Commander comes close to the borders of my personal favorite RTS games. Combine this with a grand strategy mode and it hits the spot. I'm not (read  I'm not biased) overly enthusiastic due to the fact that this game allows you to transform into a dragon, supporting your troops by providing aid, attacking, and even commanding unit production, direction, and spawning simultaneously. Honestly, I do like the complex RTS games nowadays. Think of Civilization V and similar titles. However, such games often attempt to cram complex mechanics, charts, and resources into one intricate game mode."
132,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"Undertale comes together to create something greater than the sum of its parts. The graphics, a nod to the retro title, and the music, a perfect accompaniment, harmonize to create truly beautiful and impactful moments. The script effortlessly runs the gamut from comedic to dramatic to heart-wrenching to hopeful, sometimes all at once, and does this while subverting RPG tropes and turning them on their head. Without delving into the world, characters, story, or gameplay, I could write pages about it. But I'll keep it brief  if you're a fan of RPGs, play this game. If you're a gamer, play this game. If you have seven free hours between now and your mortality, take the time to play this game."
134,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"I've had this game for only a few months, but in that short time, two DLCs have emerged, along with patches that have transformed an already excellent game into an even better one. The developers are extremely active in the community, which is evident in the various discussion forums and dev diaries. While there's a steep learning curve to the game's mechanics, I'm still learning, the breadth of strategy allows for a multitude of ways to achieve goals and capitalize on certain situations. In my opinion, the game is almost infinitely replayable, and I find myself fully immersed in every session I play, regardless of how the play-through goes."
135,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"Warframe is an enjoyable game for the initial few hours of play. However, after those hours, you'll likely find that the game's offerings become repetitive, with the combat, enemies, and gameplay becoming the primary focus. The one notable highlight is that the developers are dedicated to regularly releasing updates, which often include significant changes, new Warframes, and other improvements. While it's a decent game to play casually, it may not hold your interest beyond a few months unless you're a dedicated grinder. On the plus side, the game is free, so I recommend giving it a try. If you're looking for a quick fix, it's definitely worth a shot."
136,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"This game is incredibly dull. I had high hopes for it, thinking it was a PC version of 'Katamari Damacy', a popular and enjoyable PS2 game. Unfortunately, it falls short of that standard. In this game, you collect and absorb increasingly larger objects to grow bigger and absorb even larger ones. However, the gameplay isn't as seamless as it could be, the levels lack creativity and the content is a surreal horror show. I don't mean an entertaining horror show, but one that leaves you feeling somewhat depressed and questioning the meaning of life. Every 'living' creature in this game, from small pets to human beings, raises the question of whether the creators of this game had an interest in taxidermy."
137,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"Alright, let me explain a few things. As someone deeply interested in politics, I was very intrigued when I first heard about this game. I thought, 'Oh wow, a simulator of the road to becoming president! That sounds fun!' Unfortunately, it wasn't as exciting as I expected. The game starts off by asking you to choose a side  Republican or Democrat, with no independent or third-party option. A bit disappointed, I still remained optimistic, so I continued to see what I could do. I will give the game credit, the character customization, although limited, is quite enjoyable to mess around with. It's the only time it's an option to wear your head or not in a campaign, literally."
139,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"My stats (at the time of writing this review)  8.6 hours to reach the end, 10 collectibles found out of 25, zero achievements out of 15. What I liked  The visuals up until the last level (Ice Caves) were impressive. The story is not that great, but the ending (after the closing credits) left a somewhat positive impression, making me not regret the time I spent playing this game. What I disliked  The visuals in the last level were underwhelming, and the gameplay in the last level became frustrating due to the repetition of tasks, making it feel like I had to repeat the same actions multiple times before getting it right. Additionally, the achievements were too challenging, with only 2.1% of players achieving less than 13 out of 15."

Considering the time I wasted on the first Ghost Warrior (which was equally boring, and I feel liberated when I finished it), I probably won't play it until the end."

I could play it, and I enjoyed it, but it's not worth it. As the song goes, 'Go on, take the money and run, uh, uh, uh, uh!' It's an hour-long game, and it's awesome! Some guns are overpowered, and the matchmaking can be unfair, but hey, at least it's better than Battlefield 3's matchmaking. As a newbie, it's tough to find a fair match, especially with higher-level players who aren't even human - they just camp and shoot you in the face without any consequences."
143,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"It's not difficult for me to see why others enjoy this game, but it wasn't for me. One reason is that I have a preference for larger-scale games and I'm more interested in playing games with controllers. Additionally, the game's vast universe is awe-inspiring, but I found that same scale hindered my enjoyment. The steep learning curve and the time it took to do anything engaging at the beginning were too great for me. Perhaps if I were more patient and had more time for gaming, this might have been more compelling. However, I don't have the luxury of time, and there are many other VR games I'd rather spend my time on."
144,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"My favorite first-person shooter of all time is a game that requires precision and strategy. Run-and-gun playstyles don't apply here. The recoil and ballistics are realistic, and single hits to the chest, neck, or head from rifle-caliber weapons usually result in death unless they just graze you. Rounds drop over distance and short, controlled bursts are necessary to remain on target. There's no magical ammunition pool, so it's crucial to conserve your shots. If you reload halfway through your magazine, you'll end up with a pouch full of half-full mags. You can't keep sprinting forever, as your aim will suffer if you're not careful. Take a moment to rest your weapon on your elbows while prone or on a window sill to steady your aim. In this game, accuracy suffers when standing."
145,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"I'd like to start by stating that I didn't purchase EU at its initial release and instead acquired it on sale, which included EU, so I never experienced the issues some users claimed to have encountered. I thoroughly enjoyed the game, although it was unforgiving in its early stages, but rewarding when I got things right. As for XCOM 2, I'm a big fan of it; the game runs smoothly on my medium settings with a GTX 560 and 2GB of VRAM. Initially, the game was set to high and it ran a bit sluggishly, but not to the point of being unplayable. However, when I dropped it down to medium, it smoothed out. I'm not sure if I'm just fortunate when it comes to encountering issues with games or what, but it seems that most of the negative reviews seem to be coming from some rather entitled individuals."
146,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"This game offers a wide variety of ship types, with physics-based movement for both ships and projectiles/missiles. It's easy to learn resource management, and the game has a dark humored, non-grindy feel, especially if you utilize the civvy station types. However, it's not without its drawbacks - the AI teammates can be subpar, and there's a limited variety of equipment types and leveling skills, which don't branch out. Despite these minuses, the game still offers some variety and strategy to be had. It starts off quickly and maintains a steady pace. Although there's a limited selection of equipment, it still feels like there's always another ship to unlock or skill to level up. To increase the game's longevity, mods are the way to go. The fight for universe is easily the star, but the big fight for beef is also very good."

Instead of sensing the voltage drop caused by radiation, the proposed system measures the pulse width, i.e., the time it takes for the voltage to return to its baseline. This eliminates the need for power-hungry and large analog-to-digital converters. A prototype ASIC is fabricated in TSMC 65 nm LP CMOS process and consumes an average static power of 0.535 mW under 1.2 V analog and digital power supply.

The ability to coax larger and more tangible objects into a regime of quantum behavior has encouraged ideas for using mechanical oscillators in the processing and communication of quantum information and as precision force sensors operating beyond the standard quantum limit. However, the linear interaction between motion and light or electricity precludes access to the broader class of quantum states of motion, such as cat states or energy squeezed states. Early optomechanical proposals suggested the possibility of escaping this restriction by creating strong quadratic coupling of motion to light. Although there have been experimental demonstrations of quadratically coupled optomechanical systems, these have not yet accessed non-classical states of motion."

Unfortunately, these evaluations can be manipulated by professional spammers using fake reviews, also known as ""spams,"" which have become increasingly sophisticated and cunning. Spammers have learned to adapt to deployed detectors, making it challenging to capture their tactics. These strategies can change rapidly over time, vary across different spammers and target products, and often remain unknown to most detectors. Moreover, most existing detectors prioritize detection accuracy, which is not necessarily aligned with the goal of maintaining the trustworthiness of product reviews. To address these challenges, we propose a minimax game where spammers and spam detectors compete with each other on their practical goals that are not solely focused on detection accuracy. The Nash equilibrium of this game leads to stable detectors that are agnostic to any mixed detection strategies."

To ensure high fidelity, we utilize the Lewis-Riesenfeld (L-R) method to derive a family of solutions leading to an exact transfer, where the solutions follow a single dynamical mode of the L-R invariant. Among this family, we identify a tracking solution with a single parameter to control simultaneously the fidelity of the transfer, the population of the excited state, and robustness. We define a measure of the robustness of an uh-fidelity transfer as the minimum percentile deviation on the pulse areas at which the infidelity rises above 10^-4. The robustness of our shaped pulses is found superior to that of Gaussian and adiabatically-optimized pulses for moderate pulse areas."

We demonstrate that all local minima share the same form of structure, which partially identifies the component centers of the true mixture. Each local minimum involves a non-overlapping combination of fitting multiple Gaussian distributions to a single true component and fitting a single Gaussian to multiple true components. Our results apply to the setting where the true mixture components satisfy a certain separation condition, and are valid even when the number of components is over- or under-specified. For Gaussian mixtures with three components, we obtain sharper results in terms of the scaling between the components."

For n-partite GHZ-like states, the most robust witness scheme requires n+1 local measurement settings and can tolerate up to 1/2 white noise. In comparison, the most efficient witness for GHZ-like states requires only two local measurement settings and can tolerate up to 1/3 white noise."

The latter can break the axial and equatorial symmetry of the Kerr metric and exhibit a much richer multipolar structure, providing a portal to constrain fuzzball models phenomenologically. We find numerical evidence that all multipole moments are typically larger (in absolute value) than those of a Kerr black hole with the same mass and spin. Current measurements of the quadrupole moment of black-hole candidates impose only mild constraints on fuzzballs, while future gravitational-wave detections of extreme mass-ratio inspirals with the space mission LISA will improve these bounds by orders of magnitude."

In practice, long-term edges are often specified by humans. Human-specified edges can be both costly to produce and suboptimal for the downstream task. To alleviate these issues, we propose a model based on temporal point processes and variational autoencoders that learns to infer temporal attention between nodes by observing node communication. As temporal attention drives between-node feature propagation, using the dynamics of node interactions to learn this key component provides more flexibility while simultaneously avoiding issues associated with human-specified edges."

The equivariant stable homotopy groups of every global spectrum form a global Mackey functor, so the splittings imply that certain long exact homotopy group sequences split into short exact sequences.

Nonparametric modal clustering formulation draws a correspondence between groups and domains of attraction of density modes. Operationally, a nonparametric density estimate is required, and a proper selection of the amount of smoothing, governing the shape of the density and hence possibly the modal structure, is crucial to identify the final partition.

However, helicity selection rules for the diboson scattering amplitudes set an obstacle to the naive interference contributions of dimension-six operators, causing the total diboson rate correction's leading contribution to cancel. In this case, carefully measuring the azimuthal decay angles ""resurrects"" the interference, recouping sensitivity to the ""non-interfering"" operators. We explore these signatures in detail, and find that the EFT uncertainties associated with higher-dimensional operators are uniquely well-suppressed by the construction of an asymmetry variable which is only generated by these non-interfering operators, relegating the effects of higher-dimensional, interfering operators to the same status as statistical errors in this observable."

Like others before, we categorize the scientific contributions of data science into three classes of tasks  description, prediction, and counterfactual prediction (which includes causal inference). A clear classification of data science tasks is necessary to discuss the data, assumptions, and analytics required to successfully accomplish each task.

The standard lore is that these particles are introduced to ensure that extremal black holes are either unstable or marginally stable, but it remains unclear what would happen if this doesn't occur. This note shows that, for a generic Einstein-quantum theory of gravity in AdS, the stability of extremal black branes is in tension with rigorously proven quantum information theorems about entanglement entropy. Avoiding this contradiction leads to a non-perturbative version of the weak gravity conjecture, which reduces to the usual statement at weak coupling. The argument is general and does not rely on either supersymmetry or a particular UV completion, assuming only the validity of Einsteinian gravity, effective field theory, and holography."

Here, we demonstrate superfluidity in an ultracold 2D Fermi gas by moving a periodic potential through the system and observing no dissipation below a critical velocity vc. We measure vc as a function of interaction strength and find a maximum in the crossover regime between bosonic and fermionic superfluidity.

We identify the influence of a chiral chemical potential, i.e., the electron population imbalance between Weyl nodes of opposite chirality, on the transport characteristics of the junction. Notably, we observe a net spin polarization of Cooper pairs generated via Andreev reflection in the two WSM regions. The spin polarization is opposite in the two WSM regions and highly sensitive to the chirality imbalance and excitation energy."

However, a concern for the use of the method is the long-term stability of the implantation-induced conductivity, particularly if the implanted metal species is readily oxidized. Here, we report on our examination of the long-term behavior of the surface conductivity of titanium-implanted alumina.

The associated charge is equivalent to the skyrmion charge for any smooth configuration. Moreover, there exist singular configurations that can be identified as n_f=1 baryons, charged under the new symmetry. Under this identification, the vector mesons play the role of Chern-Simons vector fields living on the quantum Hall droplet that forms the n_f=1 baryon. We propose that this current is the correct effective expression for the baryon current at low energies. This proposal yields a unified picture for the two types of baryons, enabling them to continuously transform into one another in a natural manner. Furthermore, Chern-Simons dualities on the droplet can be interpreted as a consequence of Seiberg-like duality between gluons and vector mesons."

We generalize the Furusaki-Tsukada formula, initially established to quantify usual tunneling Josephson current flows, to evaluate the transverse current components and demonstrate that their amplitudes are widely adjustable via the spin-orbit coupling strengths or the superconducting phase difference across the junction.

In this channel, the accretion disk captures stellar-mass black holes that are initially moving on inclined orbits, and subsequently drives them to migrate towards the MBH - this process boosts the formation rate of EMRIs in such galaxies by orders of magnitude."

Under such circumstances, we still expect our recommender systems to attract users at the first time so that the users decide to stay on the website and become active users. This problem falls into the new user cold-start category, and it is crucial to the development and even survival of a company. Existing works on user cold-start recommendation often require additional user efforts, for instance, setting up an interview process, or making use of side information, such as user demographics, locations, social relations, etc. However, users may not be willing to take the interview and side information on cold-start users is usually not available."
228,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"Deep learning has successfully addressed numerous problems that were previously out of reach of heuristic algorithms. It has also been successfully applied in wireless communications, even in well-understood and optimized radio systems, where some gains have been achieved by learning individual parts of a receiver. However, a better approach is to jointly learn the entire receiver. This often results in a challenging nonlinear problem, for which the optimal solution is infeasible to implement. To address this challenge, we propose a deep, fully convolutional neural network, deeprx, which executes the entire receiver pipeline from frequency domain signal stream to uncoded bits in a 5G-compliant manner. We facilitate accurate channel estimation by constructing the input of the convolutional neural network in a very specific manner using both the data and pilot symbols."
229,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"Mutation-based fuzzing typically employs an initial set of non-crashing seed inputs, known as a corpus, from which to generate new inputs by mutation. A corpus of potential seeds often contains thousands of similar inputs. The lack of diversity in this corpus can lead to inefficient fuzzing efforts due to exhaustive mutation from all available seeds. To address this, fuzzers come equipped with distillation tools, such as afl-cmin, that select the smallest subset of seeds that trigger the same range of instrumentation data points as the full corpus. It is commonly suggested that minimizing the number and cumulative size of the seeds leads to more efficient fuzzing, which we explore systematically. Our results show the impact of five distillation approaches on finding bugs in real-world software after 34 CPU-years of fuzzing."
230,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"In this paper, we investigate multi-agent discrete-event systems with partial observation. The agents can be grouped into several categories, each of which has similar state transition structures, and can thus be relabeled into the same template. Based on this template, a scalable supervisor with a state size and computational cost independent of the number of agents is designed for the case of partial observation. The scalable supervisor under partial observation does not need to be recomputed regardless of how many agents are added to or removed from the system. We generalize our earlier results to partial observation by proposing sufficient conditions for safety and maximal permissiveness of the scalable least restrictive supervisor on the template level. An example is provided to illustrate the proposed scalable supervisory synthesis."
231,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"Electric network frequency fluctuations constitute a powerful tool in multimedia forensics. An efficient approach for ENF estimation is introduced, utilizing a novel temporal windowing strategy based on the filter-bank capon spectral estimator. A type of Goerg-Semencul factorization of the model covariance matrix is employed due to the Toeplitz structure of the covariance matrix. Moreover, this approach innovatively applies a non-rectangular temporal window, at the stage preceding spectral estimation, a departure from traditional rectangular windowing. Krylov matrices are leveraged for rapid implementation of matrix inversions. The proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in ENF estimation, when a short time window of 1 second is employed in power recordings. In speech recordings, the proposed approach yields highly accurate results with respect to both time complexity and accuracy."

The dimension reduction methods included resort into three categories  projection pursuit-based dimension reduction, sufficient dimension reduction, and robust M-estimators for dimension reduction. As a corollary, regularized regression estimators based on these reduced dimension spaces are provided as well, ranging from classical principal component regression to sparse partial robust M regression. The package also contains a set of classical and robust pre-processing utilities, including generalized spatial signs, as well as dedicated plotting functionality and cross-validation utilities. Finally, direpack has been written consistently with the scikit-learn API, such that the estimators can seamlessly be integrated into (statistical and/or machine) learning pipelines within that framework."
233,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"The nonlinear fluorescence emission has been widely applied for high-resolution optical imaging. We investigated the fluorescence anomalous saturation effect of nitrogen vacancy defects in diamond, using high-power laser excitation. This increased the nonlinearity of the fluorescence emission and altered the spatial frequency distribution of the fluorescence image. We employed a differential excitation protocol to extract high spatial frequency information. By modulating the excitation laser's power, we achieved an approximate 1.6-fold improvement in spatial resolution compared to confocal microscopy. Due to the simplicity of the experimental setup and data processing, we expect this method can be used to improve the spatial resolution of sensing and biological labeling with defects in solids."
234,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"When random effects are correlated with sample design variables, the conventional approach of using individual survey weights, constructed to be inversely proportional to the unit survey inclusion probabilities, to form a pseudo-likelihood no longer yields asymptotically unbiased inference. We develop a weight-exponentiated formulation for the random effects distribution that achieves unbiased inference for generating hyperparameters of the random effects. We contrast our approach with frequentist methods that rely on numerical integration, revealing that only the Bayesian method achieves both unbiased estimation with respect to the sampling design distribution and consistency with respect to the population generating distribution. Our simulations and real-data example for a survey of business establishments demonstrate the utility of our approach across different modeling formulations and sampling designs. This work serves as a capstone for recent developmental efforts that combine traditional survey estimation approaches with the Bayesian modeling paradigm, providing a bridge across the two rich but disparate subfields."

The reduced symmetries of these emerging materials give rise to inhomogeneous electron, optical, valley, and spin responses, as well as entirely new properties, including ferroelasticity, ferroelectricity, magnetism, spin-wave phenomena, large nonlinear optical properties, photogalvanic effects, and superconductivity. Novel electronic topological properties, nonlinear elastic properties, and structural phase transformations can also occur due to low symmetry.

236,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"The orientational dynamics in the isotropic phase of a comb-shaped nematic polymer with mesogenic and functional side groups were studied using the Kerr effect and dielectric spectroscopy. For the first time, it was found that in a mesogenic polymer, in contrast to low-molecular-weight mesogens, the relaxation of the electric birefringence of a melt above the temperature of the nematic-isotropic phase transition can be represented by a sum of several exponential processes, two of which play a decisive role. These main processes replace each other in a temperature range of approximately 50 degrees. Dielectric spectroscopy also enabled the distinction of two processes of orientational relaxation  the first is attributed to the rotation of the side mesogenic groups, and the second is associated with the motion of the main chain segments."
237,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"Deep hashing methods have demonstrated exceptional retrieval accuracy and efficiency in large-scale image retrieval. Optimizing discrete hash bits is consistently the primary focus in deep hashing methods. A common approach in these methods is to adopt an activation function, for instance, the sigmoid or tanh function, and minimize a quantization loss to approximate discrete values. However, this paradigm may result in more and more hash bits becoming stuck in the saturated area of the activation functions and failing to escape. We refer to this issue as the ""dead bits problem."" Moreover, the existing quantization loss exacerbates this issue as well. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective gradient amplifier that acts before activation functions to mitigate the dead bits problem."

We consider both the possibility that the triplets are stable and contribute to the dark matter density, or that they decay via mixing with the standard model Higgs boson. The former is constrained by disappearing charged track searches at the LHC and by dark matter direct detection experiments, while the latter is constrained by existing multilepton collider searches. We find that a two-step electroweak phase transition involving a stable triplet with a negative quadratic term is ruled out by direct detection searches, while an unstable triplet with a mass less than 230 GeV is excluded at 95% confidence level."
239,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"This study shows that the eccentric debris rings around the stars Fomalhaut and HD 202628 are narrower than expected in the standard eccentric planet perturbation scenario, also known as the pericenter glow. The standard scenario assumes an initially circular and narrow belt of planetesimals at semi-major axis a, whose eccentricity is increased to ef after the gas disc has dispersed due to secular perturbations from an eccentric planet, resulting in a belt of width 2ae_f. A minor modification to this scenario suggests that narrower belts can arise if the planetesimals are initially eccentric, which could result from earlier planet perturbations during the gas-rich protoplanetary disc phase. Alternatively, a primordial eccentricity could be caused by instabilities that increase the disc eccentricity, without the need for any planets."

In one dimension, the physics of interacting electrons is well-captured at low energies by the Tomonaga-Luttinger-Liquid (TLL) model, yet little has been observed experimentally beyond this linear regime. Here, we report on measurements of many-body modes in 1D gated-wires using a tunnelling spectroscopy technique. We observe two separate Fermi seas at high energies, associated with spin and charge excitations, together with the emergence of three additional 1D'replica' modes that strengthen with decreasing wire length. The effective interaction strength in the wires is varied by changing the amount of 1D inter-subband screening by over 45%."

It is likely that the globular cluster system of our galaxy has followed a similarly intricate formation path. To constrain this formation path, we explore the link between the globular clusters and the known merging events that the Milky Way has experienced. To this end, we combined the kinematic information provided by Gaia for almost all galactic clusters, with the largest sample of cluster ages available after carefully correcting for systematic errors. To identify clusters with a common origin, we analyzed their dynamical properties, particularly in the space of integral motion. The results show that about 40% of the clusters likely formed in situ."

Based on our micromagnetic simulation results on the nonlinear responses of MSM and STNOS with current pulse stimulation, the handwritten digits recognition task demonstrates that an RC system using one single MSM has outstanding performance on image classification. Additionally, complex unknown nonlinear dynamic problems can also be well solved by a physical RC system consisting of 24 STNOS confirmed in a second-order nonlinear dynamic system and NARMA10 tasks."

In this paper, we uncover a surprising consequence of popularity-based rankings  the fewer the items reporting a given signal, the higher the share of the overall traffic they collectively attract. This few-get-richer effect arises in settings where there are few distinct classes of items (e.g., left-leaning news sources versus right-leaning news sources), and items are ranked based on their popularity. We demonstrate analytically that the few-get-richer effect emerges when people tend to click on top-ranked items and have heterogeneous preferences for the classes of items. Using simulations, we examine how the strength of the effect changes with assumptions about the setting and human behavior. We also test our predictions experimentally in an online experiment with human participants. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the spread of misinformation."

However, most pruning techniques are essentially trade-offs between model accuracy and regularity, which can lead to impaired inference accuracy and limited on-device acceleration performance. To address this issue, we introduce a novel sparsity dimension, namely pattern-based sparsity, which encompasses pattern and connectivity sparsity, and is both highly accurate and hardware-friendly. With carefully designed patterns, our proposed pruning method consistently achieves accuracy enhancement and better feature extraction ability on various dnn structures and datasets, and our pattern-aware pruning framework also enables pattern library extraction, pattern selection, pattern and connectivity pruning, and weight training simultaneously. Our approach naturally fits into compiler optimization for highly efficient dnn execution on mobile platforms."

We investigate the effect of mountaintop removal mining (MRM) on mortality using a difference-in-differences analysis that takes advantage of the increase in MRM following the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments. For a difference-in-differences analysis of the effect of MRM on mortality, we constructed a more closely matched control group and found a 95% confidence interval that contains substantial adverse effects alongside no effect and small beneficial effects."

273,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,speech,"The world's largest and most significant environmental and industrial project is situated in the heart of the largest and most intact forest in the world, Canada's boreal forest. Spanning across northern Canada, it's home to the largest remaining wild caribou herd in the world  the George River caribou herd, comprising approximately 400,000 animals. Unfortunately, during my visit, I was unable to find one of them, but I have the antlers as proof. Throughout the boreal forest, we're fortunate to be blessed with an incredible abundance of wetlands. Wetlands, globally, are one of the most endangered ecosystems. They play a crucial role in cleaning the air, water, and sequestering large amounts of greenhouse gases, and they're home to a vast diversity of species."
274,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,speech,"Before the world of humans began, there was the world of the gods, comprising fields, plains, and gardens. Four brothers roamed this celestial realm, having no family other than each other - they didn't even know who their parents were. One of the brothers, Deminan, stood out from the others. His skin was covered in painful scars, and he wondered why he alone had been marked with this affliction. One day, while the supreme spirit, Yaya, was out in his gardens, Deminan and his brothers snuck into Yaya's house. After feasting and exploring, they spotted a giant gourd hanging in the corner. But as they tried to look inside the gourd, they dropped it."
275,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,speech,"So, I graduated seven years ago from Berkeley with a dual degree in molecular and cell biology and linguistics. I attended a career fair on campus, where I landed an interview with a start-up called Theranos. At the time, there wasn't much information available about the company, but the little that was there was quite impressive. Essentially, Theranos was creating a medical device that would enable you to run your entire blood panel on a finger-stick of blood. This would eliminate the need for a large needle in your arm to obtain your blood test results. This was intriguing not only because it was less painful, but also because it had the potential to revolutionize diagnostic testing."
276,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,speech,"My journey to become a polar specialist, specializing in the polar regions, began when I was just four years old, when my family relocated from southern Canada to northern Baffin Island, Greenland. We settled in a tiny Inuit community of 200 people, where we were one of only three non-Inuit families. In this community, we didn't have a television, nor computers, nor radio. We didn't even have a telephone. My days were spent entirely outside with the Inuit, playing. The snow and ice were my playground, and the Inuit were my mentors. It was there that I became truly captivated by this polar realm."

We accept anyone who comes to us, regardless of their background or how long they stay. We provide a haven for those who have been failed by other social safety nets, individuals who have exhausted all other options. We cannot contain them, so we must. Our role is to contain them, manage them, and guide them towards rehabilitation, as a society, we've become highly effective at that, but that shouldn't be a reason for celebration. Today, we imprison more people per capita than any other country in the world. We have more black men in prison today than were under slavery in 1850."

To do so, I'd like to share with you the origin of our solar system. Approximately 4.5 billion years ago, a cloud of gas and dust existed. At the center of this cloud, our sun formed and ignited. Simultaneously, the planets, comets, and asteroids we know today took shape. According to theory, when the Earth had cooled slightly after its formation, comets massively impacted our planet, delivering water to Earth. They likely also brought complex organic material to our planet, which may have jump-started the emergence of life."

When we created the 'Build Back Better' series, our goal was to address the issues arising from the pandemic, and imagine building back from that. However, the events of the past week, including the horrific death of George Floyd and the daily protests that followed, have brought a new sense of urgency to our conversation. We must address these issues. Can we build back better from this? Before we can even begin to answer that question, we must first seek to understand the magnitude of this moment.

280,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,speech,"In 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt embarked on a three-day camping trip in California's Yosemite Valley. He slept among towering sequoia trees, braved a snowstorm, and spent hours conversing around the campfire with his host and guide, conservationist John Muir. Roosevelt was an avid outdoorsman, but Muir had invited him to Yosemite for more than just camping  the valley was in danger. Although Yosemite had been protected land since 1864, it was still at risk of overdevelopment in 1903. The battle to set aside land for both preservation and public use had been ongoing for decades, a challenge that proved easier said than done. The struggle began with the 1849 gold rush, when miners flooded westward, seeking gold in the Sierra Nevada foothills."

I've always had a lifelong ambition to become a pilot, to fly a plane, and feel the thrill of soaring through the sky, touching the sky. Unfortunately, that dream didn't come to fruition. Gaza is a challenging place, with all borders closed on every side, making it one of the most restrictive environments in the world. Despite these limitations, I find solace in gazing up at the sky. On some days, we're lucky if we have electricity for four or five hours. When it's cold, we make do with fires on the front or on the roof of our homes."
282,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,speech,"I'm sorry, but I cannot show you my face, as it would put me in danger if I were to do so. My journey began 14 years ago, when I was a young reporter fresh out of college. I landed a scoop that was quite straightforward  police officers were taking bribes from street hawkers. As a young journalist, I believed that there must be a better way to expose this corruption, as everyone knew it was happening, yet nothing was being done to stop it. So, I decided to go undercover, posing as a street vendor myself. By doing so, I was able to gather concrete evidence. The impact was immense – it was fantastic. This is what many call immersion journalism or undercover reporting."
283,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,speech,"One simple vitamin can significantly reduce the risk of heart disease. Eating chocolate, on the other hand, has been shown to reduce stress in students. A new drug has been found to prolong the lives of patients with a rare disease. Health headlines like these are published daily, often making seemingly opposite claims from one another. There can be a disconnect between the broad, attention-grabbing headlines and the often incremental results of the medical research they cover. To avoid being misled by grabby headlines, it's essential to look at the original research they report on. We've developed a hypothetical research scenario for each of these three headlines. Keep an eye out for the explanation provided in the first example; then pause at the headline to answer the question. These scenarios are designed to be simplified for better understanding."

One day, my mom asked, ""What day should we celebrate for their birthday?"" I thought, ""The day they were born, obviously?"" It was a ridiculous question. And then my mom said, ""Well, Kristen, neither of your younger brothers have a birth certificate, so how do you suggest we determine their birthdate?"" Mind blown. Now, 20 years later, I'm still working on it, except instead of trying to solve the mystery of my brothers' missing birth certificates, I try to tackle this problem globally. So, what do birth certificates have to do with international development?"
285,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,speech,"Imagine if you could plug your brain into a machine that would bring you ultimate pleasure for the rest of your life. If you were given the choice to sign up for that kind of existence, would you? That's the question philosopher Robert Nozick posed through a thought experiment he called the Experience Machine. The experiment asks us to consider a world in which scientists have developed a machine that would simulate real life, guaranteeing experiences of only pleasure and never pain. The catch  you would have to permanently leave reality behind, but you'd hardly know the difference. Your experiences would be indistinguishable from reality. Life's natural ups and downs would be replaced with an endless series of ups, and sounds like a rather enticing prospect."

I was asked to consult with a woman in her 70s, a retired English professor, who had pancreatic cancer. I was consulted because she was experiencing pain, nausea, and vomiting. During our consultation, she inquired about whether medical marijuana might alleviate her symptoms. I reflected on everything I had learned in medical school, which didn't take long because I had learned absolutely nothing about medical marijuana."

As a firefighter, my team and I are tasked with saving lives and property from disasters such as car wrecks, house fires, and life-threatening medical emergencies. As a woman leading a department in a male-dominated profession, I decided 10 years ago to increase my medical knowledge and received a nursing degree. It became clear that the next big threat facing not only my city, but other cities around the country, was not a one-and-done disaster, where you can ride in like the cavalry, put out the fire and leave, feeling like you've made a difference and everything is okay."
288,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,speech,"Where does all the carbon we release go? Carbon plays a crucial role in a natural cycle, present in all living things  in the soil, in the oceans, in the atmosphere, and in rocks deep underground. When plants and other living organisms die, much of their stored carbon is released back to the atmosphere, where it is absorbed by new plants and other organisms. However, over millions of years, some of the carbon stored in ancient trees and sea life becomes rock, while some becomes fossil fuels  coal, oil, and natural gas. Natural events like volcanic eruptions also release some of the carbon trapped in rock. Furthermore, human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, also release a significant amount of prehistoric carbon. Today, humans release approximately 60 times more carbon than all the volcanoes on the planet each year."
289,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,speech,"Even nature's most reviled creatures harbor important secrets, but who wouldn't want to avoid a swarm of cockroaches approaching? One of the most significant differences between natural and human technologies lies in robustness. Robust systems remain stable in complex and unfamiliar environments. Notably, cockroaches can self-stabilize when running over rough terrain. When we attached a jet pack to them or subjected them to a perturbation like an earthquake, we found that their exquisitely tuned legs enable them to self-stabilize without engaging their brainpower. They can traverse complex terrain like grass effortlessly, without becoming destabilized. We discovered a new behavior where, due to their shape, they naturally roll onto their side to navigate this artificial grass test. Robust systems can perform multiple tasks with the same underlying structure. We've recently discovered a new behavior that illustrates this capability."

However, I'd like to lift your spirits by sharing a remarkable, yet lesser-known, commercial success story from the past 20 years, one that's comparable to the achievements of Microsoft or Google in its own unique way. This industry has surprisingly bucked the current recession with remarkable resilience. I'm referring to the world of organized crime. While organized crime has a long history, you're right to point out that it's been around for a long time. However, in the last two decades, it has experienced an unprecedented expansion, now accounting for roughly 15% of the world's GDP. I like to call it the global shadow economy, or the McMafia, for short. So, what triggered this extraordinary growth in cross-border crime?"

They can't – I have no idea how they work. But thinking is actually quite straightforward  it's just a matter of some kind of logical reasoning, or something. However, that's not the difficult part. Here's a list of problems that come up. One nice problem is, what do we do about health?

Many parents face tough questions and tough decisions. Should we tell our child about the sperm donation? If so, when? What words to use? Sperm donors are often referred to as ""biological fathers,"" but should we really be using the word ""father""? As a philosopher and social scientist, I have been studying these questions about the concept of parenthood. But today, I will talk to you about what I learned from talking to parents and children. I will show you that they know what matters most in a family, even if their family looks a little different."

(Cheering) I see all of that and a man who spent a quarter of his life in state prison - six years, to be exact, starting as a teenager on Rikers Island for an act that nearly cost a man his life. But what got me from there to here wasn't the punishment I faced as a teenager in adult prison or the harshness of our legal system. Instead, it was a learning environment in a classroom that introduced me to something I didn't think was possible for me or our justice system as a whole. A few weeks before my release on parole, a counselor encouraged me to enroll in a new college course being offered in the prison, which ultimately changed the trajectory of my life."

That's actually true - one's perception could be influenced by the media's portrayal of people who look like me. If some of your perceptions were negative, I don't really blame you. It's understandable, given that one study found that 80% of news coverage about Islam and Muslims is negative. And studies show that most Americans don't know a Muslim. I suppose people don't often talk to their Uber drivers. Well, for those of you who have never met a Muslim, it's great to meet you."

The first time I spoke at a conference was here at TED, eight years ago. Fresh out of grad school, I was unaware that in those few minutes on stage, I was framing the questions I would be asked for the next decade. Like many 20-somethings, I expected to solve the world's problems – more specifically, the world's water problems – with my technology. I had a lot to learn. It was seductive, believing that our biggest water quality problems persist because they're so hard to identify. And I assumed that we just needed simpler, faster, and more affordable sensors. I was wrong."

I was well-versed in all aspects of finance, and I had a deep appreciation for the global economy, which was my life's work. While I was knowledgeable about various topics, including ecology and the potential end of the world, I didn't fully subscribe to these concepts, as I didn't find them entirely convincing. In 2007, the global financial system was dealt a severe blow with the subprime crisis and the collapse of several major American banks. This event was a wake-up call, and I had several intense discussions with my wife about the limitations of the financial models I had been using. Ultimately, I came to realize that my previous perspectives were misguided, and we were headed for disaster."

As an artist, I'm drawn to working with media and technology because, on the one hand, I'm familiar with their capabilities and appreciate the power they possess. On the other hand, I'm also intimidated by that same power. I recall watching an interview in 2003 between Fox News host Tony Snow and then-US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, discussing the recent invasion of Iraq. When Rumsfeld was asked, 'We hear about our body counts, but we never hear about theirs, why?', his response was, 'We don't do body counts on other people.'"

The other thing to consider is what an honor it is, as a politician, to give a TED talk, particularly here in the UK, where the reputation of politics, with the expenses scandal, has sunk so low. There was even a story recently that scientists had thought about actually replacing rats in their experiments with politicians. And someone asked, ""Why?"" And they said, ""Well, there's no shortage of politicians; no one really minds what happens to them, and, after all, there are some things that rats just won't do.""
