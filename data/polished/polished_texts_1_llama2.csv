But now there are two great new shows on TV, and I have been watching both religiously for the last week. The gayest concept ever, that seemingly has zero gay people in sight. Hairstylist Jonathan Antin wants to build a second location to his incredibly popular West Hollywood salon, but this time in Beverly Hills. Normally, no one would care, certainly not me, but as I was flipping through the channels, I caught a glimpse of Jonathan, equally narcissistic and dull-looking at an empty space on Rodeo Drive, speaking (in a public voice) 'I am going to build here the greatest salon in the history of the world ever!' and I was hooked. Not since Rocco have I found such a moron compelling TV watching."

Tendonitis is an inflammation of the tendons, which are the tissues that connect muscles to bones. It can be caused by overuse or repetitive motion, and can be quite painful.
 It's possible that you may need to take some time off from using your arm and shoulder to allow the tendon to heal. In the meantime, you can try some gentle stretching and resting to help alleviate the pain.

It's also important to make sure you're getting enough sleep and taking care of yourself overall. Lack of sleep can exacerbate pain and make it more difficult to recover from injuries.

It's great to hear that your mom's surgery went well and that her eyesight has improved some. It's understandable that she's still experiencing some vision loss, but every little bit of improvement is a positive sign. I hope her vision continues to improve and that she's able to see clearly soon."

The citizenship ceremony in Jacksonville seemed to go off as usual, with a crowd of nearly 200 people becoming new Americans. Just before the new citizens left the June 29 event, an immigration official directing the swearing-in urged them to stop by a voter registration table - a not uncommon sight at naturalization ceremonies. However, this table was unusual: those handing out forms were Republican volunteers, and the party affiliation box had been checked off ahead of time to make all of the new voters members of the GOP. All of it was suspicious to Linda Cross, who was there to watch her husband, Dario Cruz, take his citizenship oath."

In his book, ""My Experiments with Truth,"" Gandhi reflects on the importance of non-violence and its relevance to modern society. He writes, ""As my conception of ahimsa went on maturing, I became more vigilant about my thought and speech. The lines in the anthem: 'Scatter her enemies and make them fall; confound their knavish tricks, particularly jarred upon my sentiments of ahimsa.'""
Gandhi goes on to explain how the idea of ahimsa has influenced his own life and actions, particularly in his struggle for Indian independence from British colonial rule. He writes, ""M.K. Gandhi, the story of my experiments with truth, 1927. Today is October 2, the day Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born in the year 1869.

At its core, Magic the Gathering is meant to be enjoyed with friends (or frenemies) - laughing, trash-talking, and dropping game-winning bombs. However, the daily cap on gold earnings makes it difficult to progress without grinding against the computer or random opponents. The free-to-play option is also a slow and arduous process, taking upwards of a month to unlock all the cards."

I dislike pre-quels as they technically go backwards in a story, not forwards. While they offer more storywise, the combat feels sloppy and doesn't feel as sharp as Arkham City. As of writing this review on October 26, 2013, there is a game-breaking bug that prevents a side mission from being completed (main story unaffected). Some gadgets are assigned to ridiculous hotkeys, requiring your hand to travel the entire keyboard to access them. While it may seem insignificant, this can potentially break your combo in combat."
99,hybrid,none,none,polish_1,game_review,"They basically fixed Shadow Warrior (2013)—i.e., the boss fights are awesome, weapons feel very nice (although not as good as D44m's ones, but still solid), enemies aren't too spongy (if you're not too much of a retard with handling elemental and upgrade stuff). The upgrade system is really balanced, and once you get around it, it's not too tedious. The elemental stuff and limited ammo softly forces you to use different weapons. There are lots of cool, unique weapons that stay viable throughout most of the game. The music is great, especially the main theme, and, of course, Stan Bush's stuff."

My player is an outside scorer, PG, 1.71m, has maxed stats, and got all necessary perks. Okay, and now tell me, why the shooting skill depends on a person's height? Why can't someone with 1.74m become as good in shooting as someone with 1.71m? I'm 1.87m in real life, made my first player with this height, and noticed then that I can't reach a higher skill level than 89. Why? That's pure discrimination! And why doesn't the game tell me this before I create a character, or even after I reach the skill limit after weeks of playing?!"
101,hybrid,none,none,polish_1,game_review,"I completely agree with you! The side characters in the AC series are often the most interesting and memorable characters, and they play a crucial role in the story and gameplay. They are not just there to provide additional flavor and personality to the game, but they also have their own motivations, personalities, and backstories that make them feel like real people.


And I think that's one of the things that makes the AC series stand out from other games. While other games might have a few supporting characters that are fun to play as, the AC series has a whole cast of well-developed, complex characters that you can relate to and invest in.
It's not just about getting the next collectible or completing the next side mission, it's about understanding the motivations and desires of the characters and how they fit into the larger story.
And I think that's something that sets the AC series apart from other games in the open-world genre. While other games might focus more on the open-world aspect of exploration and combat, the AC series is more focused on the story and character development. It's a game that makes you think about the motivations and actions of the characters, and how they impact the world around them.
And that"
102,hybrid,none,none,polish_1,game_review,"While I cannot wholeheartedly recommend this game, it wasn't entirely terrible. The gunplay was decent, but my main issue with it is the pay-to-win business model. It's disappointing to see a game with such potential be marred by this exploitative monetization strategy. If I could get past this, the game would be enjoyable, especially the Hardsuit and HRV features, which are fun to use. However, I cannot in good conscience recommend it to others due to its pay-to-win model. If you're okay with this type of monetization, then by all means, have at it. But for me, it's not my cup of tea."
103,hybrid,none,none,polish_1,game_review,"While not perfect, this game has been greatly enjoyable. The save system and possibility of sudden death leads to some frustration. I'm on my first playthrough and I lost my main character around hour 10 of 20ish. Would have really liked a save to reload at that point. I've since picked up a third-party mod/save tool to avoid catastrophic failures. Plus, the aiming reticule is on the small side, and the zoom is underpowered. Despite these issues, it's been a blast. I'm not normally a zombie fan, but the combination of strategy, missions, first-person shooter/beat 'em up is great. I've been playing it as often as I can get away... Just one more mission, just one more supply run - or I'm running away and want to get safe before shutting the game down.""

The in-game chat box at the main menu is very entertaining as well, not kidding. However, if anyone thinking this game is 'easy', or if you're new to the strategy genre, it could take you quite some time to get it nailed down. Don't get upset, you will lose a lot of units.

The voice actors for Optimus, Megatron, Bumblebee, and others are back, and their distinctive voices are instantly recognizable. The cell-shaded presentation is perfect, and it's amazing how well it captures the look of the original cartoon. However, the gameplay is more than just a nostalgic trip. The combat mechanics are well-done, and transforming mid-fight is a necessity that's seamlessly integrated into combos. It's unlike High Moon's excellent War for Cybertron games, but the focus on melee combat is a welcome change of pace. Some enemies, such as the Seekers, require a switch to a ranged blaster, adding some variety to the combat."

The game's controls can be a bit tricky to get used to, especially if you're coming from a console background, but the game does offer a good variety of control options to suit different playstyles.


The game's default controls are set up for a gamepad, with the right analog stick for movement, the left stick for aiming and shooting, and the face buttons for interacting with the game world and using your gadgets. However, you can also customize the controls to suit your preferences.
You can rebind the controls to your keyboard and mouse, or use a gamepad with custom layout. The game also supports VR controls, so if you have a VR headset, you can play the game with even more immersive controls.

It also lacks a pause button, or if it does have one, I never found it. Considering that many sequences in the game are timed, this seems like a critical oversight.

The combat is challenging but not too difficult, and the gadgets you acquire throughout the campaign add some nice new gameplay mechanics.

This was when the game was at its best. All of the guns were equally overpowered, so there were no balance issues; everyone could kill anyone at any time. Additionally, the game used to offer unlimited gun slots and five loadouts. It's surprising that a game with 'bajillions of guns' doesn't provide more than six weapon slots and three loadouts without requiring payment. At one point, I had about three pages worth of guns, and I was excited to come up with new ideas for more, as I found it enjoyable to have a wide variety of weapons."

I eagerly anticipate each combat encounter, and they've done an excellent job of optimizing combat. I was initially hesitant about the naval combat system, but it's surprisingly enjoyable to unleash chaos on multiple fleets at once! The only way to lose in this game is to fail to retreat. If the combat looks too overwhelming, just step away, regroup, and counter-attack. Thank you, developers, for creating an exceptional experience!"

While longtime fans of the original series may be displeased with the alterations to their beloved character, it is undeniable that the new game by Ninja Theory has improved the series. This installment serves as a great entry point for newcomers to the series, offering a compelling origin story for a more arrogant and cynical Dante. The game masterfully weaves a clear narrative arc for the new Dante, making him a captivating character to follow.

As the story progresses, it showcases Dante's transformation from a cynical and self-centered individual to a selfless and heroic figure. Throughout the game, the narrative effectively conveys Dante's growth and development, making him a more relatable and sympathetic character.

Its story is absolutely charming, filled with detail and bundled with happiness, bad puns, and annoying dogs. It's serious when it needs to be, but never takes itself too seriously, always finding time for funny moments. The character design is on point, with various characters each with their own unique personalities and secrets. What sets it apart from other RPGs is that you don't have to kill anyone, a concept that's often overlooked in the genre. With clear inspiration from Earthbound, one of the best RPGs I've seen, you can tell that it's going to be good. The soundtrack is also top-notch, one of the best I've heard in a long time."

It's almost as if the game is poking fun at the idea of the emptiness and meaninglessness of modern life, and the way it can consume and warp our perceptions of what is beautiful and meaningful.

The use of taxidermy in the game is particularly interesting, as it creates a sense of uncanny valley, where the living and the dead are blurred together. The idea that the creators of the game may have an interest in taxidermy is a thought-provoking one, and it adds an extra layer of depth to the game's themes of existential dread and the absurdity of modern life.
Overall, I think the game is a thought-provoking and unsettling experience that challenges the player to confront their own perceptions of beauty and meaning in life."

On the one hand, the visuals and sound design were impressive and engaging throughout the game, particularly in the earlier levels. The variety of environments and enemies were interesting and challenging, and I enjoyed the sense of progression and accomplishment that came with completing each level. However, as the game progressed, the visuals became less impressive and the gameplay became more frustrating. The last level in particular was particularly challenging, as the game's difficulty spiked significantly and I found myself repeating the same actions over and over again until I finally managed to complete it. Additionally, the achievements were not as rewarding as I had hoped, with only 13 out of 15 achievements being unlocked by less than 2% of players. Overall, while the game had some enjoyable moments, it was not without its flaws and I would not recommend it to those looking for a challenging and rewarding gaming experience."

Instead of sensing the voltage drop caused by radiation, the proposed system measures the pulse width, i.e., the time it takes for the voltage to return to its baseline. This obviates the need for using power-hungry and large analog-to-digital converters.

These strategies are difficult to detect, as they evolve rapidly, vary among spammers, and remain largely unknown. Most existing detectors prioritize detection accuracy, but this approach is not optimal for maintaining the trustworthiness of product evaluations. To address these challenges, we formulate a game-theoretic approach that pits spammers and detectors against each other, with each side seeking to maximize their respective goals. The Nash equilibria of this game lead to detectors that are robust against a wide range of spamming strategies."

To ensure high fidelity, we use the Lewis-Riesenfeld (L-R) method to derive a family of solutions leading to an exact transfer, where the solutions follow a single dynamical mode of the L-R invariant. Among this family, we identify a tracking solution with a single parameter to control simultaneously the fidelity of the transfer, the population of the excited state, and robustness. We define a measure of the robustness of an uh-fidelity transfer as the minimum percentile deviation on the pulse areas at which the infidelity rises above $10^{-4}$. The robustness of our shaped pulses is found superior to that of Gaussian and adiabatically-optimized pulses for moderate pulse areas.""

Due to nonconvexity, there exist multiple local minima that are not globally optimal, even when the mixture is well-separated. We show that all local minima share the same form of structure, which involves fitting multiple Gaussians to a single true component and fitting a single Gaussian to multiple true components. Our results hold for the setting where the true mixture components satisfy a certain separation condition, and are valid even when the number of components is over- or under-specified. For Gaussian mixtures with three components, we obtain sharper results in terms of the scaling with the separation between the components."

We explore these signatures in detail and find that the EFT uncertainties associated with higher-dimensional operators are uniquely well-suppressed by the construction of an asymmetry variable that is generated only by these non-interfering operators, relegating the effects of higher-dimensional, interfering operators to the same status as statistical errors in this observable."

The WdS argument is based on the observation that, in the Einstein-Hilbert action, the metric tensor $g_{\mu\nu}$ is not invertible at small distances, meaning that the gravitational field cannot be well-defined as a classical field at these scales. This is because the gravitational potential $V$ is not a small parameter in the action, and so the Einstein-Hilbert equation

We identify the influence of a chiral chemical potential, i.e., the electron population imbalance between Weyl nodes of opposite chirality, on the transport characteristics of the junction. Remarkably, we observe a net spin polarization of cooper pairs that are generated via Andreev reflection in the two WSM regions. The spin polarization is opposite in the two WSM regions and highly sensitive to the chirality imbalance and excitation energy.

And 20 minutes later, that two-and-a-half-year-old finds herself completely submerged in water."
261,hybrid,none,none,polish_1,speech,"You’ve been accused of a crime you did not commit. It’s impossible to prove your innocence. If you insist that you’re innocent anyway, you’ll likely be found guilty and executed. But if you confess, apologize, and implicate others for good measure, you’ll go free. Do you give a false confession— or risk a public hanging? This was the choice facing those accused of witchcraft in the village of Salem, Massachusetts between February 1692 and May 1693. They were the victims of paranoia about the supernatural, misdirected religious fervor— and a justice system that valued repentance over truth. Salem was settled in 1626 by Puritans, a group of English Protestants. Life was strict and isolated for the people of Salem. Battles with their Native American neighbors and groups of French settlers were commonplace."
262,hybrid,none,none,polish_1,speech,"""There are hundreds of thousands of people on transplant waiting lists, waiting for critical organs such as kidneys, hearts, and livers that could save their lives. Unfortunately, there aren't nearly enough donor organs available to fill that demand. What if instead of waiting, we could create brand-new, customized organs from scratch? That's the idea behind bioprinting, a branch of regenerative medicine that is currently in development. We're not yet able to print complex organs just yet, but simpler tissues such as blood vessels and tubes responsible for nutrient and waste exchange are already within our grasp. Bioprinting is a biological cousin of 3-D printing, a technique that deposits layers of material on top of each other to construct a three-dimensional object one slice at a time."

But you need to share it with the world. Ok, curiosity killed the cat, you take the bet, you look at the crystal ball. One hour later, you're sitting in a building of the national TV, in a top show, and you tell the story."
266,hybrid,none,none,polish_1,speech,"Currently, most refugees reside in urban areas rather than in refugee camps. We represent over 60 percent of the total number of refugees worldwide. With the majority of refugees living in urban areas, there is a pressing need for a paradigm shift and new thinking. Rather than squandering resources on building walls, it would be more beneficial to invest in programs that support refugees in helping themselves. (Applause)We always have to leave behind all our possessions. However, not our skills and knowledge. If given the opportunity to live a productive life, refugees can contribute to the development of their host country.I was born in the city of Bukavu, South Kivu, in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

For about five years after graduating from an upstanding liberal arts university, this was my day job. (laughter) I was a self-employed living statue called the eight-foot bride, and I love telling people I did this for a job, because everybody always wants to know, who are these freaks in real life. (laughter) Hello. I painted myself white one day, stood on a box, put a hat or a can at my feet, and when someone came by and dropped in money, I handed them a flower – and some intense eye contact. And if they didn't take the flower, I threw in a gesture of sadness and longing – as they walked away."
269,hybrid,none,none,polish_1,speech,"On October 4, 1957, the world watched in awe and fear as the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the world's first man-made satellite, into space. This little metal ball, smaller than two feet in diameter, launched a space race between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. that would last for eighteen years and change the world as we know it. Sputnik was actually not the first piece of human technology to enter space. That superlative goes to the V-2 rocket used by Germany in missile attacks against allied cities as a last-ditch effort in the final years of World War II. It wasn't very effective, but, at the end of the war, both the U.S. and U.S.S.R. had captured the technology and the scientists that had developed it and began using them for their own projects."

As an avid reader, my literary tastes range from Ian McEwan to Stephanie Meyer, with a particular fondness for the Twilight series. My home theater is my sanctuary, where I indulge in a variety of DVDs, video on demand, and television shows, with a special fondness for ""Law & Order: SVU,"" ""30 Rock,"" and ""Judge Judy"" – the people, the cases, and the rulings are all so real and captivating."
271,hybrid,none,none,polish_1,speech,"The climate emergency is the defining crisis of our time, and we are in a race against time. The growing tide of impatience among young people for global inaction is palpable. It's time for all of us - governments, cities, businesses, investors, and individuals - to step up and take action. I'm pleased to see TED Countdown launching, as it has the potential to accelerate momentum towards a carbon-neutral world by 2050. With the tools, science, and resources at our disposal, let us harness the political will and energy needed to avert the worst impacts of global heating."
272,hybrid,none,none,polish_1,speech,"Menstruation. A natural biological process that shapes our bodies and our lives, yet it's shrouded in stigma and secrecy. Despite the fact that over 800 million women worldwide are experiencing their periods right now, many of us still feel embarrassed to talk about it. I know from personal experience and the accounts of those around me that it's a source of discomfort, exhaustion, and even shame. It's exhausting to furtively tuck a brown paper bag containing a pad into my pocket during class, or try to hide my cramps and discomfort in meetings and social situations. It's time to break the silence and challenge the stigma surrounding menstruation. It's a natural part of life, and we should be able to talk about it openly and without fear of judgment."
273,hybrid,none,none,polish_1,speech,"The world's largest and most devastating environmental and industrial project is situated in the heart of the largest and most intact forest in the world, Canada's Boreal Forest. It stretches across northern Canada, including Labrador, and is home to the largest remaining wild caribou herd in the world, the George River Caribou Herd, which numbers approximately 400,000 animals. Unfortunately, during my visit, I couldn't locate any of them, but you have their antlers as proof. Across the Boreal, we are blessed with this incredible abundance of wetlands. Wetlands, globally, are one of the most endangered ecosystems, and they play a critical role in cleaning air, water, and sequestering large amounts of greenhouse gases. They are also home to a vast array of species."
280,hybrid,none,none,polish_1,speech,"In 1903, the president of the United States took a three-day camping trip in California's Yosemite Valley. President Theodore Roosevelt slept in a grove of towering sequoia trees, camped in a snowstorm, and spent hours talking around the campfire with his host and guide, conservationist John Muir. Roosevelt famously loved the outdoors, but Muir had invited him there for more than just camping: Yosemite was in danger. Although Yosemite became protected land in 1864, the valley was still at risk for overdevelopment in 1903. It was at the heart of a decades-old struggle to set aside land for both preservation and public use—two goals that were much easier said than done."

(applause) My ambition has always been to be a pilot and fly a plane, to feel free to fly the sky, to touch the sky. But that didn't happen. Unfortunately, I live in Gaza, and there is no airport. All borders are closed on every side. We live in one of the biggest prisons in the world. The only thing I can do is just look up to the sky. On some days, we are lucky if we have electricity for four or five hours. When it's cold, we make a fire on the front or on the roof of our homes."
282,hybrid,none,none,polish_1,speech,"I am sorry I cannot show you my face, because if I do, the bad guys will come for me. My journey started 14 years ago. I was a young reporter fresh out of college. Then I got a scoop. The scoop was quite a simple story. Police officers were taking bribes from street vendors. As a young reporter, I thought I should do it in a different way to maximize the impact, since everyone knew it was happening and yet nothing was keeping it out of the system. So I decided to go undercover and act as a vendor. As part of selling, I was able to document the hardcore evidence. The impact was great. It was fantastic."
286,hybrid,none,none,polish_1,speech,"I would like to share with you a personal experience that has had a significant impact on my career as a palliative care physician. A few years ago, I was consulted to see a 70-year-old retired English professor who had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. As a consultant, I was asked to assess her symptoms, which included pain, nausea, and vomiting. During the consultation, she inquired about the potential benefits of medical marijuana. I was taken aback by her question, as I had learned very little about medical marijuana during my medical training. I had to rely on my clinical judgment and professional experience to provide a thoughtful and compassionate response. I explained to her that while I understood her interest in medical marijuana, it was not a widely accepted treatment for pancreatic cancer at the time, and I could not recommend it as a viable option. I also acknowledged the potential risks and uncertainties associated with its use. Despite my reservations, I empathized with her desire to explore all possible treatment options, and I offered to discuss the matter further with her oncologist. The encounter left a lasting impression on me, as it highlighted the importance of staying up-to"

As a firefighter, my team and I are tasked with saving lives and property from various disasters, including car wrecks, house fires, and life-threatening medical emergencies. As a woman in a male-dominated profession, I have also been committed to expanding my medical knowledge, and 10 years ago, I received a nursing degree. Realizing that the next major threat facing not only my city but also other cities across the country was not the one-and-done disaster, where we can simply ride in, put out the fire, and leave, feeling like we have made a difference and everything is okay, I have dedicated myself to providing ongoing medical care and support to those in need."
288,hybrid,none,none,polish_1,speech,"Carbon is a vital element that is present in all living things and is an essential component of all living organisms. It is also found in the soil, oceans, and rocks deep underground. When living things die, their carbon is released back into the atmosphere, but some of it becomes trapped in rocks and sediments, forming fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas. Natural processes like volcanic eruptions and human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, release some of this trapped carbon into the atmosphere. Today, humans release about 60 times more carbon than all the volcanoes on Earth each year."
289,hybrid,none,none,polish_1,speech,"Even nature's most disgusting creatures have important secrets, but who would want a swarm of cockroaches coming towards them? Yet one of the greatest differences between natural and human technologies relates to robustness. Robust systems are stable in complex and new environments. Remarkably, cockroaches can self-stabilize running over rough terrain. When we put a jet pack on them, or give them a perturbation like an earthquake, we discovered that their wonderfully tuned legs allow them to self-stabilize without using any of their brainpower. They can go over complex terrain like grass, no problem, and not get destabilized. We discovered a new behavior where, because of their shape, they actually roll automatically to their side to go through this artificial test bit of grass. Robust systems can perform multiple tasks with the same structure."
290,hybrid,none,none,polish_1,speech,"These are grim economic times, fellow Tedsters, grim economic times indeed. And so, I would like to cheer you up with one of the great, albeit largely unknown, commercial success stories of the past 20 years. Comparable, in its own very peculiar way, to the achievements of Microsoft or Google. And it's an industry which has bucked the current recession with equanimity. I refer to organized crime.

Now, organized crime has been around for a very long time, I hear you say, and these would be wise words, indeed. But in the last two decades, it has experienced an unprecedented expansion, now accounting for roughly 15 percent of the world's GDP. I like to call it the global shadow economy, or McMafia, for short.

So, what triggered this extraordinary growth in cross-border crime?"
293,hybrid,none,none,polish_1,speech,"When I look in the mirror today, I see a justice and education scholar at Columbia University, a youth mentor, and a future New York State senator. (cheers) I see all of that and a man who spent a quarter of his life in state prison—six years, to be exact—starting as a teenager on Rikers Island for an act that nearly cost a man his life. But what got me from there to here wasn't the punishment I faced as a teenager in adult prison or the harshness of our legal system. Instead, it was a learning environment of a classroom that introduced me to something I didn't think was possible for me or our justice system as a whole. A few weeks before my release on parole, a counselor encouraged me to enroll in a new college course being offered in the prison."
295,hybrid,none,none,polish_1,speech,"We must build a weather service for water. However, until we collectively demand accountability, the incentives to fund it will not materialize. The first time I spoke at a TED conference was eight years ago, when I was fresh out of graduate school. Little did I know that in those few minutes on stage, I was framing the questions I would be asked for the next decade. And, like many 20-somethings, I believed that I could solve the world's water problems—more specifically, the world's water quality problems—with my technology. I had a lot to learn. It was seductive to assume that our biggest water quality problems persist because they are difficult to identify. And I wrongly presumed that we just needed simpler, faster, and more affordable sensors. I was mistaken."

I like working with media and technology because a, I'm familiar with them and I like the power they hold. And b, I hate them and I'm terrified of the power they hold. (laughter) I remember watching, in 2003, an interview between Fox News host Tony Snow and then-US Defense Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld. They were talking about the recent invasion of Iraq, and Rumsfeld is asked the question, ""Well, we're hearing about our body counts, but we never hear about theirs, why?"" and Rumsfeld's answer is, ""Well, we don't do body counts on other people."""

Well, well. That's unusually prescient for a human. Looking for a wedding dress? Try a new take on a timeless classic. It's sleek, flattering, and modest—just like the traditional dress.commercials. Could anything be more insufferable? It's 1997, and the United States Senate has called a hearing about global warming.

The other thing to think of is what an honor it is, as a politician, to give a TED Talk, particularly here in the UK, where the reputation of politics has sunk so low. There was even a story recently that scientists had thought about replacing rats in their experiments with politicians. And someone asked, ""Why?"" And they said, ""Well, there's no shortage of politicians, no one really minds what happens to them, and, after all, there are some things that rats just won't do."" (Laughter) Now, I know you all love data, so I'm starting with a data-rich slide."
