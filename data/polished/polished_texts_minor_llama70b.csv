1,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Another week just flew by. I drove by the new house yesterday and the front window was covered in boxes. We may get the keys at closing, and I'm getting so excited. If all goes well this week, we will be set for closing a week from Wednesday. I was up until after 3:00 am last night watching movies with Bethany. There has been a lot of movie watching going on around here lately. Here's my rundown: last night we watched Thirteen, a movie every mother of a teen should see. It was better than I expected. Then we watched Gigli - yeah, it was just as bad as the media said it was, but we had to see for ourselves."
2,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Summer TV used to be a dead zone full of repeats, but now there are two great new shows on TV, and I've been watching both religiously for the last week. One of them, ""Blow Out,"" has the gayest concept ever, yet seemingly has zero gay people in sight. Hairstylist Jonathan Antin wants to build a second location for his incredibly popular West Hollywood salon, this time in Beverly Hills. Normally, no one would care, certainly not me, but as I was flipping through the channels, I caught a glimpse of Jonathan, equally narcissistic and dull, looking at an empty space on Rodeo Drive and saying, in a public voice, ""I'm going to build here the greatest salon in the history of the world ever!"" and I was hooked. Not since Rocco have I found such a moron so compelling to watch."
3,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"What a week... My right shoulder has tendonitis. It's located right under my shoulder blade. So, when I move my arm too much, mainly when using a mouse on a computer, it's excruciating. I can barely move it now because I was on a spree updating my website and working on other online things. I can barely muster the strength to draw anything. Lack of sleep is also exacerbating my pain. I'm not too happy right now, but I'll get better. My mom's surgery went okay. Her eyesight has partially returned; she can see fuzzy shapes and make out colors. Other than that, she's still largely blind. Hopefully, she'll fully regain her vision soon."
4,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Kindness of strangers... I attempted laundry today with the kids in tow and realized how quickly the simplest things can become a chaotic ordeal. I also learned how remarkably sweet total strangers can be for no reason other than because they feel like being kind. Trust me, it wasn't like they were trying to impress me or anything. I had kid drool all over me and was wearing my 'wash-day' outfit... Also, I'm not sure I'll ever be bathing again, so it's not like there was even an olfactory incentive there. Right now, I'm doing two things simultaneously. I'm composing this post and watching the collected No Doubt videos, both from the comfort of my desk in my room."
5,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"It's 11:14pm MST, and I'm sitting in my bedroom fixing the personal computer of the personnel director from my job. Not that I mind doing it, but I sometimes wonder how often I find myself fixing someone else's computer as a favour. I'm glad to be able to show love and care for people in this way, but where is the line drawn before it becomes a case of being taken advantage of? The last couple of weeks, I've been staying up late reading and such, so I was looking forward to an early night, until I realized it would be more prudent to return this computer to its owner. *laugh* No rest for the weary, right? So I ended up watching Joe Schmo 2 again tonight."
6,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Remind me, what did I write about before this? Or, a continuation in the 'is this a date?' saga. So, after the weird lunch, my confidence was shaken. I forgot to tell you guys an important piece of the story. Before Pat shows up to lunch, Dustin starts talking about what a nice guy Pat is and how he's trying to find a girlfriend for him. I'm listening and nodding, realizing that we're talking more about finding Dustin's best friend a girl than discussing whatever it is you discuss with a stranger over pink lemonade. I excused myself to the bathroom, looked in the mirror, and then silently asked myself: am I being pawned off to the other guy? Is this what happens now?"
7,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"I would like everyone to think before they act. Ideally, I'd like each person in the world to think before they get out of bed in the morning, and make a commitment to keep thinking all day. If they're not prepared to do so, I'd rather they stayed in bed and drifted off to sleep. I'm tired of dealing with people who lack common sense. I'm not claiming to be the smartest person in the world, but I'm not talking about complex issues that require a lot of brain power. I think it's fair to criticize those who are willfully ignorant. Let's focus on a few specific types for now and save the rest for another day, sound good? Great."
8,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Two problems with the scenario outlined in my previous post: 1. While it's true that Bush is stimulating the economy, he's doing so in the wrong way. Robert Rubin told NPR's Marketplace today that Bush could have achieved the same stimulus effect without the long-term debt hangover by enacting different tax cuts - temporary ones that would benefit low- and middle-income individuals. Ah, Robert Rubin - the sound of his name is music to our ears. Quick: name one Bush administration cabinet official on the domestic side with Rubin's gravitas. Still thinking? It'll come to you... 2. We can't give the Republicans control only in wartime because they've ingeniously concocted an endless, global 'war on terrorism.'"
9,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"'She's saying I'm on the run, I'm chasing guys for fun' ~The Offspring. I haven't updated in a while, but there's not much to say. Went to The Cove to see Supernova, they were good as usual, and got to chill with Tiago. On Saturday, I went to work and then out with Joe and Rach, met up with Steve, Tiago, and Tom. Came home at quarter to 12 and woke up the next morning at quarter to 7 for a meet. Got there a little late, but it's all good - I did my full routine on floor and didn't fall, came second on floor and vault, and third on beam, with an all-around score of 29.45, which isn't bad since my meets tend to get better as the season goes on."
10,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Do you ever have one of those moments when you start to reflect on life? Like when you're sitting in math class, feeling extremely bored, and you wonder what exactly goes on in your brain that makes you understand math? You realize that you exist, you're in math class, and you wonder why. Then it hits you - the fact that existing is actually amazing. But suddenly, it dawns on you that going off on this random train of thought is pretty pathetic. Has that ever happened to you? I hate that feeling. You know what else I hate? Block schedules. Who would come up with such an idea? It's clear that sitting through a two-and-a-half-hour class in any subject is cruel and unusual punishment."
11,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"I think that Monopoly has run its course in my life, and I vow to never lay my hands on that iron piece again. Tonight, Andy beat me by a few small dollars and won the game, or maybe I let him win since he's leaving in a few short hours and I wanted him to feel good on his last night here. However the story goes, it can't compare to this Texas-sized headache I have at the moment. I've taken some Aleve, and I must say that they're doing the trick; all I need now is some well-deserved rest and relaxation. Your telephone's the one that helped me wrap the cord around your neck... At the Drive-In."
12,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Today's been a long day, we had to drive home from Indiana. I guess I'll have to be choosy about what I write about, as I could easily take up a lot of time and space, and I just don't have enough energy. First off, I have to say that camp was awesome, even better than I could have expected. God's been doing so much in my life lately, and it's just amazing. I've sort of turned over a new leaf, I guess, but anyway, back to the beginning. We arrived at the Twiggs' house on Friday evening and stayed until we left for camp on Monday. Most of what we did was visit the fair, go to church, attend a parade, go to Walmart, and watch movies."
13,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Today is my last day of summer vacation! I'm really going to miss it. I have a dentist appointment at 9, which I'm not thrilled about, but I'd rather get it over with than try to schedule it during the first month of my surgery rotation. I'm feeling nervous, scared, and jittery about going back to school - to be honest, I'd rather not go at all. This is going to be a whole new challenge for me. As a perfectionist, I love excelling at everything I do, but starting new things is tough. I hate feeling like I'm just a pawn, and I hate not knowing what's going on - as I told Cassie, I'm like a pawn on a chessboard who insists on moving like a knight."
14,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Arun Shourie talks about how the present Governor of Uttar Pradesh had warned, as far back as 1996, about the impending threat of the rise of a 'third Islamic state' in the subcontinent. T V Rajeswar, the former head of the Intelligence Bureau and the present Governor of Uttar Pradesh, had predicted this dire threat in a series of articles published in the Hindustan Times, way back in 1996. Shourie raises a valid point when he says, does the fact that you now know that he, and not I, to say nothing of Mr Advani, wrote all that make the warnings ring true? Or do you conclude that because he wrote in this refrain, T V Rajeswar is a closet communalist and should not be allowed to continue as Governor of Uttar Pradesh?"
15,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Attitude: bored, mood: indifferent. I'm looking forward to tonight after a long, hard day in the trenches here. Unfortunately, I've had almost no time to write anything for you readers. However, it's great to see Tigger (now Akcron) taking the reins and making an appearance, discussing various topics. Not much to say, but yesterday's Shakespeare on the Green was a lovely play, although I had to leave before the closing curtain, which was disappointing. Hopefully, someday I'll get to see an entire Shakespeare play. Akcron is right about the issues with the shower - it's not great. On a lighter note, the look people get when they're struggling can be quite entertaining, I have to admit."
16,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"All of a sudden, for the past two days, I have been overcome with terrible bouts of exhaustion - bone-dead exhaustion. Last evening, I went home and just slept off, only getting up when my mother called me around eight thirty. When I woke up, it was all dark, and I hadn't switched the lights on, so I couldn't figure out what time or date it was. For a few seconds, it was just my mother's voice in the darkness and me grappling with reality. I wonder why I'm feeling so drained. The weather was nice this morning, though - it was drizzling when I came. Although in Calcutta, I hear it's been raining for the past three days."
17,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Last night was the worst. I threw away the sweater I was knitting. I only had about 14 inches done. I lost probably $10 worth of yarn (it's $8 a skein). However, it had too many stitches by the time I got to the arm holes, and the mohair was knotting itself together as I knitted, so frogging (ripping out rows) didn't work well. The yarn broke a lot. I didn't even swear, which is unusual for me. I just morosely ripped and listened to season two of Sex and the City (thanks to the library!). And then I got sick of it and threw it away. I suppose I could say I learned a lot while trying to make this sweater."
18,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Last night in class, we discussed that week's assigned reading, ""Getting Back into Place: Toward a Renewed Study of the Place-World"" by Edward S. Casey. The first chapter deals with ""implacement"" and the second, ""displacement."" In the first chapter, Casey makes the distinction that our contemporary world and culture revolves around time as the situating force: we are running out of time, we have saved time, we are just in time. He argues that using place as the center of culture gives a more grounded community. (This is a very rough summation, a disclaimer in case my professor or any other classmate happens to read this post.) So far, this book is the first reading that has really grabbed my attention."
19,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Whatever it is they put into freeze pops to make them those colours, there should be some sort of warning: may make your life a bit bizarre. And while giggling is good, one wonders if we would have found ourselves up that fire escape drinking beer in the fierce wind had we not been eating them earlier. Finding ourselves in a doorway to a bar sadly closed for business, we stopped to examine an office-supplies catalogue that had arrived in the post. Luckily, we did. Who could possibly have guessed that within these pages were the special offers of a lifetime? Not I, for certain. I list but a few: buy 36 permanent marker pens, get a stunt kite; buy 30 lever arch files, get a barbecue."
20,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Currently listening to: The Little Drummer Boy by Stevan Pasero... and now my post. Senate Republicans, hands up - who watched the 39-hour judicial nominations debacle last week? I know I didn't. Well, okay - I did tune in once or twice. The entire colossal waste of time was perpetrated by Republicans who, upset that Democrats wouldn't roll over and nominate four of Bush's conservative justices, were trying to score political points by holding a multi-day protest. Never mind the fact that the Democrats have already approved 168 of Bush's judicial nominees - no, that's not good enough for the power-hungry Republicans who are laboring under the misapprehension that they have a huge mandate for this kind of nonsense."
21,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"This was a good weekend. I spent a lot of time outdoors, after a long time, and I listened to a lot of Nevermore (something I should have started doing much earlier) and read a lot. I finished three books over the weekend - Bruce Sterling's Heavy Weather, Larry Niven's World of Ptavvs, and Octavia Butler's Parable of the Sower. Heavy Weather was a good cyberpunk romp through a near-future USA, devastated by global warming and general anarchy. While it was clever, well-paced, and altogether very convincing, I must confess that I failed to come away with any really significant impressions about the story or the characters. Not that both aren't well-constructed and vividly etched - it's a good book, but not a great one, I guess."
22,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Because this is the aftermath, the first week back from practicum was a struggle, but it's only in the second week that the smoke has really started to clear. Post-practicum trauma was a hidden epidemic that is only now coming to light. I was stricken, but an eventual meeting with the course coordinator allowed me to release my burden, and by doing so, I have prevented another person from being stuck with such a pedagogically deficient practicum school. Yesterday (Monday), I bumped into another aggrieved classmate who was quite determined to go to the student who was due to go to her school in the next practicum and tell him how terrible it would be. I calmed her down and said that we should go to the administrator first."
23,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Things are incredibly busy here at times, but there's always time for supposed stress-relieving activities. I've found that I'm really bad at 8-ball and ping pong. Rick (the Canuck) beats me on a regular basis - we have a ping pong table in the front lobby of our building, so there's always time for a 'quick round'. Last night, I participated in an 8-ball tournament at the Hot Spot (our recreation tent, complete with a popcorn machine, numerous TVs, a jukebox, DVD rental, a pool table, a dartboard, and an ever-present ping pong table). I was doing pretty well throughout my one entire game, until I scratched on the eight ball. I still had a fairly good time, though - the most fun was when two Dutch soldiers joined in the tournament."
24,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Fall 1974: I was attempting, for what felt like the 13th time, to fight my way through the second chapter of my high school algebra book. I was not then, nor am I now, a math person. I hate math; I'm math-phobic. You get the picture. So, as I struggled to make sense of algebra, the doorbell rang. I put down my book and went to open the door. No one was there. Great. I returned to my studies, and just as I was finding a little glimmer of understanding buried in my subconscious, the doorbell rang again. Bam, just like that, my breakthrough disappeared. I went to the door, and once again, no one was there. Just what a struggling math student needs – an uninvited practical joker."
25,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"This past week has been nothing short of exhausting. I spent Tuesday through Thursday finishing the move to my new classroom. The new room is bigger and closer to my grade level team, which are key factors to consider as I spend hours preparing my room for this year. Had I known I was going to move prior to the end of my school year, I would have discarded many of the books and supplies I no longer use. Unfortunately, it all came with me. So this week was spent moving, unpacking, and purging extensively. I have to thank my teammate Jill for helping with all of this. You see, she was still teaching this month in my old room, so she and her lovely students moved almost my entire room for me."

Even if I never carried your child, even if I was never married to you, even if I was never your official partner... I loved you immensely, and to this day the feeling carries an echo through my heart. Forever, I will always be reminded of the very few nights we spent together, hearts and limbs entwined in a soul-embrace, drenched in the salty darkness of an evening by the beach... or a kiss under the rain. Whenever I get the feeling of a dark glass puncturing my heart, you will be there. That piece of you... bleeding the eternal love that once lived in me... and still remains. For heri."

Or let me rephrase that, the article I'm working on and its consequences aren't exactly something I'm comfortable with. Perhaps it's because I don't believe in it enough, that I struggle to fully grasp the passion and angst behind it. The full-out passion to question. I've grown up in a country where you don't ask questions. Really, you just don't. They'll shoot you for that, or put you in jail under internal security acts. I'm not used to this freedom of speech...not used to questioning out loud. Sure, I'm not the easiest person to get along with."
28,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"We had an outing yesterday with my coworkers at the bank. We visited Guintubdan, La Carolota. It was the first time for most of us. We trekked to the falls, which took around 30 minutes, leaving us all catching our breaths. But we made it. The water was icy cold, making our bodies numb from the chill. We only stayed for less than an hour before heading to the nearby waterfalls, another 30-minute trek. However, the trip was worth it, as the falls looked calming and the entire scene was breathtaking. It felt like being one with nature, and soaking in the cold water was like communing with Mother Earth. The cold air and water were enough to lull us to sleep."

It's one thing I didn't inherit from the Buenviajes - the desire to drink. There are few times I don't mind drinking, but let's just say they're very rare. We have a month left before Ed leaves. I think it's starting to sink in with Ed and with all of us. I think it sunk in with me a long time ago. I just hope Ed will be here for Bailey's surgery. We've been keeping an eye on his swelling, and there's definitely quite a bit of it."

However, it turned out it was actually on Friday. Luckily, I had brought a bag of eggs with me just in case. So, Connor had a great time finding eggs in the park. On Sunday morning, when he woke up, he was thrilled to discover that the Easter bunny had come. There's nothing better than seeing the excitement on your child's face. After the egg hunt, we all attended church. Although the 'Easter bunny' is fun, we make sure our kids understand the true meaning of the holidays. This was Megan's first Easter, and she looked adorable in her jean dress and stockings."

I somehow managed to get a flat tire. Luckily, I'm at work, so the guys are going to inflate it for me and make sure it holds air. If not, they're going to change my tire and put the spare on it.

32,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"I know in a previous post I defended parents, almost taking their side, but here's a slight change of heart. Parents don't know anything. They think they know us so well, maybe even to the point where they can read emotions off our faces. They can't. Parents know nothing about us. And when I go upstairs after arguing with Nicole about Kelli, like I just did a few minutes ago, and they want me to tell them what's wrong, I feel like saying, ""How about you just listen for once?"" I don't have to share my problems with them all the time. The situation with Nicole and Kelli is simple: they don't like each other at all."

Thankfully, I skillfully managed to move my car from the far left lane to the far right and got onto Route 50. This probably means nothing to anyone unless you live around here, so never mind. I'm just happy to be sitting here instead of still stuck in my car. Yesterday, Sara decided to Google me, and it turned out that the email I wrote to Ivan Meisel on ESPN.com was published online.

The observers will come from the OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights. This will be the first time such a team has been present for a U.S. presidential election. Meanwhile, a baker's dozen of congressional Democrats, including four New Yorkers, has petitioned U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to dispatch international observers to Florida to oversee this year's presidential balloting there. I humbly disagree. Based on the available information, the OSCE seems to be coming here to learn from the U.S. election process, not to oversee it, which was the original partisan and childish call for U.N. involvement."

I also get to enjoy a morning off, but I do need to call a man at KMIZ to get his rate card.

By Gary Fineout and Alfonso Chardy, the citizenship ceremony in Jacksonville seemed to go off as usual, with a crowd of nearly 200 people going home as new Americans. Just before the new citizens left the June 29 event, an immigration official directing the swearing-in ceremony urged them to stop by a voter registration table - a not uncommon sight at naturalization ceremonies. However, this table was unusual: those handing out forms were Republican volunteers, and the party affiliation box had been checked off ahead of time to make all of the new voters members of the GOP. All of this was suspicious to Linda Cross, who was there to watch her husband, Dario Cruz, take his citizenship oath."

Nothing like 48 hours of daydreaming to get one's creative energy back. I have it good for a foreigner, and my timing was good, too. The illustration part is the icing on the cake. I'd probably complain more if that didn't fall into my lap. I know I am getting ripped off, though. I'm not blind to that fact. I'm getting hungry.

Before I could blink, my best friend from Florida walked through the door, which made me smile. I had missed him so much.

As a non-American blogger, I've been a little reluctant to get involved in some of these discussions, particularly the bits about flags, but since I started the subject, I suppose I'd better say something. Firstly, I think the idea of having a law against flag-burning is completely nuts. The moment you start according a symbol - any symbol - that kind of automatic reverence and protection, you've taken a small but important step towards totalitarianism. Symbols are inherently fickle - they don't inherently represent anything in themselves; it's what they are perceived as meaning or made to represent that's important."

The rate schedule effective from August 2000 through September 2000 yields a much larger commodity charge because SDG&E customers will receive a lump sum reimbursement from SDG&E over those two months, resulting in lower electric bills. Assuming that the lump sum reimbursement is not included in the implicit energy component, the average from June 2000 through January 2001 is 6.2 cents, and the implicit commodity average from February 2001 through December 2001 is 7.3 cents.

This review is based solely on my experience playing MyCareer, and so far, it's a 10/10.

98,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"Being the 3rd installment in the trilogy, I'll address the negative aspects first. I'm not a fan of prequels, as they technically move the story backward rather than forward, which is an issue common to all prequels. However, they do offer more storywise. The combat feels sloppy and lacks the sharpness that Arkham City achieved. As of writing this recommendation (26/10/2013), there's a game-breaking bug that prevents a side mission from being completed, although the main story remains unaffected. Some gadgets are assigned to ridiculous hotkeys, requiring your hand to travel across the entire keyboard to access them. While it may seem minor, this can potentially disrupt your combo during combat."
99,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"They basically fixed Shadow Warrior (2013), with awesome boss fights, nice-feeling weapons (maybe not as good as D44M's, but still solid), and enemies that aren't too spongy (if you're not too careless with handling elemental and upgrade stuff). The upgrade system is really balanced, and once you get the hang of it, it's not too tedious. The elemental mechanics and limited ammo gently encourage you to use different weapons. There are many cool, unique (a key difference from Borderlands' 'rng' formula) weapons that remain viable throughout most of the game. The music is great, especially the main theme and, of course, Stan Bush's contributions."

My player is an outside scorer, a point guard, 1.71m, with maxed stats and all necessary perks. Now, tell me, why does the shooting skill depend on a person's height? Why can a person who is 1.74m not become as good at shooting as a person with 1.71m? I'm 1.87m in real life, made my first player with this height and noticed then that I couldn't reach a higher skill than 89. Why? That's pure discrimination! And why doesn't the game tell me that before I create a character, or even when I reach the skill limit after weeks of playing?"
101,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"I think this Assassin's Creed nailed the mechanics on all fronts, including ship battles, sailing, hunting, parkour, and more. I felt a stronger attachment to this character as well. Although the story starts out rough, it significantly improves as you progress, which I think is a common trend in the AC series. Edward was an interesting character, and the side characters were equally engaging. I found that the collectibles in this game had a greater purpose and meaning, which I hadn't experienced in previous AC games. While they weren't required, they were enjoyable to collect and provided a balanced reward system."
102,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"While I personally cannot recommend this game, it wasn't absolutely terrible. The gunplay is alright, as long as you have the money to purchase gun parts, which would be my main complaint with this game: it's pay-to-win. If I could get past that, the game would be enjoyable, as the hardsuit is fun to use and the HRV is an excellent idea. I'd take this game over any Call of Duty title any day, but its pay-to-win microtransaction format is off-putting for me. If you're alright with this model, then by all means, have fun. But if you're like me and dislike pay-to-win games, just let this one slide; it's not our cup of tea."
103,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"While not perfect, this game has been greatly enjoyable. The save system and possibility of sudden death lead to some frustration. I'm on my first playthrough and I lost my main character around hour 10 of a 20-hour playthrough. I would have really liked a save to reload at that point. I've since picked up a third-party mod/save tool to avoid catastrophic failures. Additionally, the aiming reticule is on the small side and the zoom is underpowered. With all that said, it's been a blast. I'm not normally a zombie fan, but the combination of strategy, missions, first-person shooter, and beat-em-up elements is great. I've been playing it as often as I can, always thinking, ""Just one more mission, just one more supply run"" - or I'm running away and want to get safe before shutting the game down."
104,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"An absolutely great strategy game. Having played every single other wargame (European Escalation and ALB), I have to say this one fits well. The number of units is great - I'm not sure exactly how many there are, but there's a huge variety. The graphics are beautiful, the sounds are great, and the gameplay overall is epic. The in-game chat box at the main menu is also very entertaining, and I'm not kidding. However, if anyone thinks this game is 'easy', or if you're new to the strategy genre, it could take you quite some time to get the hang of it. Don't get upset, you will lose a lot of units - just make sure you plan ahead, always have anti-air and anti-tank units."

The portal gun and portal concept seemed weird to me, despite my fondness for science fiction. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The jokes and voice acting in this game are phenomenal - just amazing. While it can be cheesy at times, the humor is generally well-executed. Each story character has their own unique sense of humor, and their distinct personalities shine through. The level design is also impressive. Notably, I never played the first Portal game, but I plan to do so if I can spare the time. Playing the sequel actually sparked my interest in the original."

Now, for my thoughts. I love this game. It's probably one of the best RPGs or games in general that I've ever played. So, if you're an RPG fan, you probably already have this game."
107,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"Yes, this is a nostalgia trip for thirty-somethings who remember watching the ever-irritating Timmy Mallet in the UK, just for the five-minute Transformers cartoon. The voice actors for Optimus, Megatron, Bumblebee, and many others are back, and instantly recognisable. The distinctive cartoon transformation sound is also present. Graphically, the cell-shaded presentation is perfect and very faithful to Generation One. But aside from that, it's actually a very enjoyable game. The combat mechanics are extremely well done, with transforming mid-fight often being a necessity, seamlessly woven into combos, making it quite distinct from High Moon's excellent War for/Fall of Cybertron games. Another distinction is the heavy focus on melee combat, although some enemies, such as Seekers, require a switch to a ranged blaster."
108,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"I downloaded the game and played it for a little while, but it was nothing special. I spent more time trying to log in than actually playing the game. There's a bug where it says there's an update to the terms of service, and whenever you click 'accept', it just pops up again. You have to restart the client for it to work. Although that isn't too bad, I'm not sure why I need to link my Steam and Gface accounts. They claim it's for DLC, but why is that necessary? It's also not reversible, so now I know that a company I don't care about has access to my Steam information. The game itself is just average. It's easily recognizable as a COD clone, except somehow they managed to make the gunplay worse... How is that even possible?"

In my opinion, this is a really great and fun game, although the format may be somewhat annoying, where the free-roam city area repopulates with new enemies every time you progress the story. I particularly enjoyed the 'dual play' segments, where you can play as Batman and another character, and the ability to use the controller for most segments of the game, but the mouse and keyboard for the tank combat segments, was greatly appreciated. Driving the Batmobile around the free-roam city, including when chasing the APC commanders, is actually quite enjoyable once you figure out how to use the brakes to skid around corners, and when you master that, driving around the city is really quite enjoyable."

It looks, sounds, and plays great, with great FPS mechanics, a nice story, cool characters, flawless voice acting, and a badass soundtrack. Not for the faint of heart, though - some of those cutscenes were pretty darn cruel and vivid. But when a game is overall so great, it's easier to spot the flaws, and here they are as I saw them: - no SLI support - what the heck? I had to put the game away until I upgraded my card, as it ran too poorly on my old dual-GPU GTX 590.

However, don't buy this game thinking it's like COD, Battlefield, or any other shooter game. It's a game in its own class and should be treated as such. I've lost count of how many times I hear new players complain and get frustrated about getting killed quickly. Oh, the shock of getting shot in the face and dying - it's not like that doesn't happen in real life. Edit: After playing this game for a while now and investing a significant amount of money, I can say it's one of the best multiplayer games around. It's a great alternative to play when you're not in the mood for CS:GO."

The gameplay is solid, the art design is beautiful, the music is surprisingly high-quality and fitting, the story and world have me intrigued, and the puzzles are enjoyable. However, the best aspect of this game, beyond all these positives, is its comedic value. If you've played any RPG since the dawn of video game RPGs, you'll appreciate the various jokes, parodies, and references; if you're new to RPGs, you'll still enjoy the game for its humor. If you've played Final Fantasy 7 or X, you absolutely need to play this game - without giving too much away, I had to stop playing after 2 hours to give my cheeks a break from laughing and smiling so much. What a delight so far."
115,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"I'm really sorry, I try to be supportive of free-to-play games and indie developers, but I really didn't enjoy this game. The description sounded right up my alley, but the execution fell flat. I love puzzle and exploration games, but I found this game to be completely unintuitive, and even after looking up how to progress, I still just didn't find the gameplay itself fun. It also lacks a pause button, or if it does have one, I never found it. Considering that many sequences in the game are timed, this seems like a critical oversight. I also feel like this game is more cut scene than actual gameplay, and I end up just sitting around waiting a lot."

My gut churned the whole time, but I kept going for Uncle Fred! If you guys made a DLC or a second game, I would be the first to buy it and recommend it to everyone I know.

Unlike previous games, which followed the Earth's timeline through periods like the Stone Age, Medieval Age, and Modern Age, this game takes place in the future, where you're on a mission to colonize a new planet. What I enjoy about this game is that 2K took a new approach and added mechanics like the affinity system and orbital layer. However, I found that these new mechanics could be overwhelming at times. One potential improvement could be incorporating new artwork, such as the environment you experience when communicating with another leader."
118,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"Great game! Tons of replayability and very fun zombie survival game! Definitely in my top 5 zombie games ever played. Edit: After playing 60+ hours, I can honestly say this is one of the better, more 'realistic' zombie games. It's very much designed like a survival horror, where you must save up your ammo, heal your own wounds when you bleed out, take pills when you're infected, etc. Also, I find the zombies to feel very natural and well animated for a free-to-play game. P.S.: I would recommend getting 1 or 2 friends to play with, but the community is super friendly and you can usually make friends or talk with people in the chat or over voice comms."
119,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"02/07/2014 - It's a shame I can't thoroughly recommend or enjoy this game, as from the short time I've played it, I know I'd be addicted if it didn't have the following two game breakers. Firstly, there are no Aussie servers - one red bar puts you at a severe disadvantage and creates unbearable lag. Notably, I played through the offline training mode and it was stuttering and lagging as well (how does that even happen?). Coupled with the poor ping, it just ruins the game. Secondly, everything artifacts like crazy - menus, backgrounds, training, and in-game. I've never had this happen before with this card and thought it might not like my OC. I set my GPU back to stock and, sure enough, it didn't make a difference."
120,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"I finished this very late last night. The story isn't particularly deep or interesting, but the storytelling is what makes it stand out. The atmosphere is rich and immersive, and the numerous collectibles do a great job of fleshing it out. I learned a lot about the world of Batman, so it was a bit disappointing that there were so few bosses in the game. However, there are plenty of future games to rectify that. The combat offers the right amount of challenge, but it's slightly on the easy side. Leveling up Batman wasn't very satisfying, but upgrading and acquiring new gadgets during the campaign adds nice new gameplay mechanics. Gaining access to previously unreachable places provides a nice sense of progression."
121,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"'To the Moon' is no mere game... Nay, it is a veritable experience, and it was one of the best of my life, at that. Think Telltale's 'The Walking Dead' is sad? Hohoho! Well, it's no match for 'To the Moon'! Never before have I been so depressed yet fulfilled over something purely fictional. This masterpiece represents the pinnacle of storytelling in my opinion, and the soundtrack is a gorgeously charming and perfect accompaniment. Yes, the controls are a bit finicky and the gameplay is not the strong point, but the story is so fantastic that I didn't care one bit. Plus, the humor of the game is great as well, and it definitely doesn't intrude upon the distinguished nature of the story... And the 'Doctor Who' references are endless."

There's quite a lot of choice in the game, with options to build structures that give you an advantage, choose which weapons to use, and select power-ups for those weapons, as well as decide which drinks to use for bonus effects. The art style and music in the game are fantastic, with everything looking so colourful at times - who says the apocalypse has to be dull? Best of all, the game features narration that responds to your actions as the player. So, if you pick up a weapon and then switch it for another in the armoury, the narration will reflect this, commenting on your new choice of weapon."
123,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"I had originally bought this game in early development, when the only currency was spacebux and there was no 'tech tree'. This was when the game was enjoyable. At that point, all guns were equally overpowered, so there were no issues with imbalance; anyone could kill anyone at any time. The game also used to offer unlimited gun slots and five loadouts. You would think that for a game boasting 'bajillions of guns', they would at least provide more than six weapon slots and three loadouts before requiring payment for additional slots. At one point, I had about three pages worth of guns and was planning new ideas for more, as that's where I found the game to be fun."
124,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"This game was a surprising gem. One often sees rave reviews of certain products that are often misleading. In this case, the reviews accurately reflect the fun of this neat little game. It's an odd mix between a classic 2D platformer and a MOBA, and it pulls it off with style. I found myself enjoying characters that I wouldn't normally enjoy in other MOBA games. I had expected this trait to continue, but decided to give a melee tank a try anyway. I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome and ended up trying out more as they were unlocked through gameplay. The art style and interface are oddly charming. As a result, I now use one of the characters as my avatar and a wallpaper created from a card set for the game."
125,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"I've just started playing, but I love this game. I put on my headphones and lose myself in the game for hours at a time. It's been a while since a game has had that effect on me. The music sets the mood, the sound effects are spot on, and the controls are perfect. I look forward to every combat, and they've optimized combat extremely well. I had my doubts about the naval combat system, but it's so much fun to lay waste to multiple fleets at a time. The only way to lose in this game is to fail to retreat. If the combat looks overwhelming, just get out of there, regroup, and counter-attack. Thanks, devs, for an awesome experience!"

While fans of the original series may be upset at the change to their beloved character, it's certainly for the better; and this new game by Ninja Theory proves it. DMC serves as the perfect point for newcomers to jump into the series. It shows the origins of an arrogant, cynical Dante, and it chronicles his journey from cynicism to selflessness. Throughout, the game weaves a clear narrative arc for the new Dante, making him a compelling character to watch. The story follows Dante as he's introduced into the corrupt world he willfully chose to ignore."

What sets it apart from other RPGs is that you don't have to kill anyone, a refreshingly unused concept in the genre. Drawing inspiration from Earthbound, one of the best RPGs I've seen, it's clear that this game is something special. The soundtrack is also noteworthy, easily the best I've heard in a long time."
128,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"I am recommending this solely because it's free, and it might be a more enjoyable experience for others. As for my experience, the game did nothing for me. Half the story relies on shock factor, but I was neither shocked nor emotionally moved in any way. Maybe I'm desensitized, or maybe it was too simple to warrant a reaction from me. The other half of the game attempts to paint a picture (literally) of a person in mental decline, dealing with obsession, hallucination, depression, and a few other themes. In theory, it's a cool idea. However, the game took me only 10 minutes to complete, even with reading and taking in every bit of information I could."
129,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"Do I even need to explain why Portal is amazing? Portal is a puzzle game that introduces a concept and then steps aside. It's an amazing way to test your mind while still being fun. Although this game isn't as story-heavy, it did give birth to one of the most popular games of 2011. I still play this game and beat it when I'm feeling bored, and I love to come back and see what gave birth to a legend and what is a legend. Gameplay: Portal's gameplay is quite simple to explain, at least. You use portals to your advantage, along with buttons that activate a part of the puzzle. There are two types of buttons in the game: one that you press and one that requires a cube to be placed on it."

Since most of these reviews focus on specs, I'll include mine: i5 6600k (~200€), Radeon RX480 (~200€), Z170 Pro Gaming (~150€), and 16GB DDR4 RAM (~70€) - ~650€, which is definitely within the medium price range.

Divinity: Dragon Commander reaches awfully close to the borders of my personal favorite RTS game. Combine this with a huge Risk-like grand strategy mode and it hits the spot. I try not to be overly biased, but the fact that this game allows you to turn into a dragon, aiding your troops by supporting, attacking, and even commanding unit production, direction, and spawning at the same time, is a major plus. Honestly, I do like complicated RTS games nowadays, like Civ V and so on. However, such games often attempt to cram complex mechanics, charts, and resources all into one complicated game mode."
132,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"Undertale comes together to make something greater than the sum of its parts. The graphics are solid for a retro title, and the music is nice, but paired together they create truly beautiful and impactful moments. The script runs the gamut from comedic to dramatic to heartbreaking to hopeful, sometimes all at once, and does this while turning RPG tropes on their head. And all of this without touching on the world, characters, story, and gameplay... I could write whole pages about it. But instead, I'll just say this: if you like RPGs, play this game. If you like video games, play this game. If you have seven free hours between now and your death, play this game."

The developers are very active in the community, and this is evident in the various discussion forums and dev diaries. There is a fairly steep learning curve to the game's mechanics, which I'm still trying to master; however, this breadth of strategy offers a myriad of ways to achieve goals and capitalize on certain situations. In my opinion, the game is almost infinitely replayable. I find myself fully immersed in every session I play, regardless of how the playthrough is going."
135,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"Warframe is a fun game for the first few hours of play. After those initial enjoyable hours, you'll begin to notice that the game's offerings are limited to repetition in its combat, enemies, and gameplay. The one major high point for the game is that the developers are working hard and release semi-frequent updates that generally include a lot of content, from sweeping changes to some of the game's systems, new warframes, and other tweaks and features. It's a good game to play casually, though I doubt it will hold your attention beyond a few months unless you enjoy grinding. The upside is that the game is free, so I'd recommend trying it out if you're looking for a quick fix."
136,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"This game is extremely boring. I bought it because I believed it was a PC version of 'Katamari Damacy', a popular and enjoyable PS2 game. Sadly, it falls far short. In this game, you absorb increasingly larger objects to grow bigger and absorb even more. However, the gameplay isn't as smooth as it could be, the levels lack inventiveness, and the overall experience is a surreal horror show that's more depressing than entertaining. It makes you question the value of life. Every 'living' creature in the game, from small pets to human beings, is unsettling, making me wonder if the creators had a fascination with taxidermy."
137,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"Alright. Let me explain a few things. As a person very interested in politics, I was intrigued when I first heard about this game. I thought, 'Oh wow, a simulator of the road to becoming president! That sounds fun!' Well, it really wasn't. The game starts you off and says you need to pick a side: Republican or Democrat, with no option for Independent or third party. A little disappointed, but still optimistic, I carried on to see what I could do. I will give the game credit, though - the character customization, although limited, is pretty fun to mess around with. It's literally the only time it's an option to wear your head or not in a campaign."
138,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"Fallout 3 had a better storyline. Settlements often get in the way, making you feel like you're babysitting instead of progressing through the story. Some keys are hard-coded and cannot be rebound. The game is plagued by bugs. At one point, my Pip-Boy disappeared permanently, and I had to research console commands to retrieve it. Power armor is easily accessible from the start, and power cores are readily available in trader shops, greatly diminishing its value compared to previous Fallout games. The story is mediocre, and everything about this game is average, except for its stability - it doesn't crash every 10 minutes like Fallout 3. However, it's not better than Fallout 3 or New Vegas. The hype surrounding this title is unwarranted, given its overall quality."

What I liked:

- Although the story isn't great, the ending (after the closing credits) somewhat redeemed my time spent playing this game 

What I disliked: 
- The visuals in the last level are uninteresting 
- The gameplay in the last level becomes significantly harder, making it a frustrating experience of repetition until you get it right

I wouldn't recommend it unless it's 90% off, and even then, I find playing this game to be an extremely boring chore, only playing to finish it and move on to the next game in my library. Given the time I wasted on the first Ghost Warrior (which was equally boring and left me feeling relieved when I finished it), I probably won't play this one until the end."

For one thing, I have a Vive and I'm much more interested in playing room-sized games with the controllers. Beyond that, the game is initially awe-inspiring in the scale of its universe, but I also felt that same scale hindered my enjoyment. The learning curve and the time required to do anything interesting at the beginning were both too large for me. Perhaps if I were more patient and had more time for gaming, this would be compelling to me. But I don't have either, and there are plenty more VR games I'd rather spend my time on."
144,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"Hands down, my favorite first-person shooter of all time. Run-and-gun Rambo types need not apply. Recoil and ballistics are realistic, with single hits to the chest, neck, or head from rifle-caliber weapons almost always resulting in death, unless it's just a graze. Rounds drop over distance, and short, controlled bursts are required to remain on target. There's no magical ammunition pool - if you reload halfway through your magazine all the time, you'll end up with a pouch full of half-full mags. You can't run forever; sprinting for a while will cause your aim to suffer as you gasp heavily until you catch your breath. Resting your weapon on your elbows while prone or on a window sill can help steady your aim, as accuracy suffers when standing."
145,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"Let me start by saying I didn't purchase EU when it first came out, and I got it on sale, which included EW, so I never experienced the issues that some people claim to have had with that game. I loved that game, however; it was unforgiving in the early stages but rewarding when you did things right. As for XCOM 2, I love it - the game plays pretty well for me on medium, and I'm running a GTX 560 with 2GB of VRAM. At first, the game was set to high, and it was running a bit sluggishly, but not to the point of being unplayable; when I dropped it down to medium, it smoothed out. Not sure if I'm just lucky when it comes to having issues with games or what, but it seems that most of the negative reviews sound like they're coming from some really entitled people."
146,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"This game offers RPG levelling, a wide variety of ship types, physics-based movement for both ships and projectiles/missiles, and easy-to-learn resource management. It also has a dark humor tone. However, it can be grind-intensive if you underutilize the civilian station types, and the AI teammates are sub-par. Additionally, there's a low variety of equipment types and levelling skills, with no branching options. Despite these drawbacks, the game is incredibly fun. There's still some variety and strategy to be had, and it starts off fast, with plenty of opportunities to unlock new ships or level up skills. The mods, particularly Fight for Universe and Big Fight for Beef, can significantly increase the game's replay value."

This phenomenon is called ""podcasting,"" and its strongest proponent is former MTV host and VJ (video jockey) Adam Curry. Podcasting takes its name from the Apple iPod, although you don't need an iPod to create or listen to a podcast. Essentially, a podcast is an internet-based radio show that podcasters create, usually in the comfort of their own home, using just a microphone, a PC, and some editing software. They then upload their shows to the internet, allowing others to download and listen to them for free."

Instead of sensing the voltage drop caused by radiation, the proposed system measures the pulse width, i.e., the time it takes for the voltage to return to its baseline, thereby eliminating the need for power-hungry and large analog-to-digital converters. A prototype ASIC is fabricated in TSMC 65 nm LP CMOS process and consumes an average static power of 0.535 mW under a 1.2 V analog and digital power supply.

The problem is formulated as a bi-level optimization, where dynamic tolls are optimized in the upper level, and the lower level is a mixed equilibrium simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment model considering a mixed fleet of AVs and HDVs."

This capability has not only allowed for the demonstration of quantum behavior in increasingly larger and more tangible objects, but also sparked ideas for utilizing mechanical oscillators in quantum information processing and communication, as well as precision force sensors that operate beyond the standard quantum limit. However, the effectively linear interaction between motion and light or electricity limits access to a broader class of quantum states of motion, such as cat states or energy squeezed states. Early optomechanical proposals suggested that creating strong quadratic coupling of motion to light could overcome this restriction. Although experimental demonstrations of quadratically coupled optomechanical systems have been achieved, they have yet to access nonclassical states of motion."

Unfortunately, these evaluations can be manipulated by professional spammers using fake reviews, who continually adapt and develop increasingly sophisticated spamming strategies to evade deployed detectors. Capturing these strategies is challenging, as they can change rapidly over time, vary across spammers and target products, and often remain unknown. Moreover, most existing detectors prioritize detection accuracy, which may not align with the ultimate goal of maintaining trustworthy product evaluations. To address these challenges, we propose a minimax game framework where spammers and spam detectors compete to achieve their practical objectives, which extend beyond mere detection accuracy. The Nash equilibria of this game yield stable detectors that are robust to various mixed detection strategies."

To ensure high fidelity, we used the Lewis-Riesenfeld (L-R) method to derive a family of solutions leading to an exact transfer, where the solutions follow a single dynamical mode of the L-R invariant. Among this family, we identified a tracking solution with a single parameter to control simultaneously the fidelity of the transfer, the population of the excited state, and robustness. We defined a measure of the robustness of an ultra-high fidelity transfer as the minimum percentile deviation on the pulse areas at which the infidelity rises above $10^{-4}$. The robustness of our shaped pulses was found to be superior to that of Gaussian and adiabatically-optimized pulses for moderate pulse areas."

Due to nonconvexity, multiple local minima exist that are not globally optimal, even when the mixture is well-separated. We show that all local minima share a common structural form that partially identifies the component centers of the true mixture, in the sense that each local minimum involves a non-overlapping combination of fitting multiple Gaussians to a single true component and fitting a single Gaussian to multiple true components. Our results apply to the setting where the true mixture components satisfy a certain separation condition and are valid even when the number of components is over- or under-specified. For Gaussian mixtures with three components, we obtain sharper results in terms of the scaling with the separation between the components."

This algorithm can resolve near-exact collisions, with mutual separations of a fraction of the physical radius, using the same time-step as in weakly perturbed problems, such as the solar system. We demonstrate the long-term behaviour of the algorithm on systems of six super-Earths experiencing strong scattering over 50 kyr.

A widely used tool for detecting entanglement is the entanglement witness, where the measurement of the witness operator is guaranteed to be positive for all separable states and can be negative for certain entangled states. In reality, due to the exponentially increasing Hilbert-space dimension with respect to the system size, it is very challenging to construct an efficient entanglement witness for general multipartite entangled states. For n-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-like states, the most robust witness scheme requires n+1 local measurement settings and can tolerate up to 1/2 white noise. In comparison, the most efficient witness for GHZ-like states only needs two local measurement settings and can tolerate up to 1/3 white noise."

We develop a general method to extract the multipole moments of arbitrary stationary spacetimes and apply it to a large family of horizonless microstate geometries. These geometries can break the axial and equatorial symmetry of the Kerr metric and have a much richer multipolar structure, providing a portal to constrain fuzzball models phenomenologically. We find numerical evidence that all multipole moments are typically larger in absolute value than those of a Kerr black hole with the same mass and spin. Current measurements of the quadrupole moment of black-hole candidates can place only mild constraints on fuzzballs, while future gravitational-wave detections of extreme mass-ratio inspirals with the space mission LISA will improve these bounds by orders of magnitude."

We consider a common scenario where edges represent either short-term interactions (e.g., messaging) or long-term structural connections (e.g., friendship). In practice, long-term edges are often manually specified by humans, which can be both costly to produce and suboptimal for downstream tasks. To address these issues, we propose a model that combines temporal point processes and variational autoencoders to learn temporal attention between nodes by observing their communication patterns. By driving between-node feature propagation through temporal attention, this approach offers greater flexibility while avoiding the drawbacks associated with manually specified edges."

In particular, the restriction homomorphisms between the orthogonal, unitary, and symplectic groups of adjacent dimensions are naturally split epimorphisms. The interest in these splittings stems from equivariant stable homotopy theory, as the equivariant stable homotopy groups of every global spectrum form a global Mackey functor. Consequently, the splittings imply that certain long exact homotopy group sequences decompose into short exact sequences. For the real and complex global Thom spectra $\mathbf{mo}$ and $\mathbf{mu}$, the splittings imply the regularity of various Euler classes related to the tautological representations of $O(n)$ and $U(n)$."

Operationally, a nonparametric density estimate is required, and a proper selection of the amount of smoothing, which governs the shape of the density and hence possibly the modal structure, is crucial for identifying the final partition. In this work, we address the issue of density estimation for modal clustering from an asymptotic perspective."
215,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"The tails of diboson production at the LHC are sensitive to the interference between the Standard Model and higher-dimensional operators that parameterize the effects of heavy new physics. However, helicity selection rules for diboson scattering amplitudes pose an obstruction to the naive interference contributions of dimension-six operators, causing the leading contribution to the total diboson rate correction to cancel. In this case, carefully measuring the azimuthal decay angles ""resurrects"" the interference, recouping sensitivity to the ""non-interfering"" operators. We explore these signatures in detail and find that the EFT uncertainties associated with higher-dimensional operators are uniquely well-suppressed by constructing an asymmetry variable that is only generated by these non-interfering operators, relegating the effects of higher-dimensional, interfering operators to the same status as statistical errors in this observable."
216,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"Causal inference from observational data is a primary goal of many data analyses in the health and social sciences. However, academic statistics has often been skeptical of data analyses with a causal objective. The introduction of the term ""data science"" presents a historic opportunity to redefine data analysis in a way that naturally accommodates causal inference from observational data. Like others before us, we categorize the scientific contributions of data science into three classes of tasks: description, prediction, and counterfactual prediction (which encompasses causal inference). An explicit classification of data science tasks is necessary to discuss the data, assumptions, and analytics required to successfully accomplish each task. We argue that a failure to adequately describe the role of subject-matter expert knowledge in data analysis is a source of widespread misconceptions about data science."
217,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"The weak gravity conjecture (WGC) demands the existence of superextremal particles in any consistent quantum theory of gravity. The standard lore is that these particles ensure extremal black holes are either unstable or marginally stable, but it is unclear what the implications are if this does not occur. This note demonstrates that, for a generic Einstein quantum theory of gravity in AdS, exact stability of extremal black branes is in tension with rigorously proven quantum information theorems regarding entanglement entropy. Avoiding this contradiction leads to a nonperturbative version of the WGC, which reduces to the usual statement at weak coupling. The argument is general and does not rely on supersymmetry or a particular UV completion, assuming only the validity of Einsteinian gravity, effective field theory, and holography."
218,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"Understanding how strongly correlated two-dimensional systems can give rise to unconventional superconductivity with high critical temperatures is a major unsolved problem in condensed matter physics. Ultracold two-dimensional Fermi gases have emerged as clean and controllable model systems to study the interplay of strong correlations and reduced dimensionality, but direct evidence of superfluidity in these systems has been lacking. Here, we demonstrate superfluidity in an ultracold two-dimensional Fermi gas by moving a periodic potential through the system and observing no dissipation below a critical velocity v$_{\rm c}$. We measure v$_{\rm c}$ as a function of interaction strength and find a maximum in the crossover regime between bosonic and fermionic superfluidity. Our measurement establishes ultracold Fermi gases as a powerful tool for studying the influence of reduced dimensionality on strongly correlated superfluids."
219,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"An ordinary differential equation (ODE) is a mathematical model used in various application areas, such as climatology, bioinformatics, and chemical engineering, due to its intuitive appeal to modeling. Despite the widespread use of ODEs in modeling, the frequent absence of their analytic solutions makes it challenging to estimate ODE parameters from data, particularly when the model has numerous variables and parameters. This paper proposes a Bayesian ODE parameter estimation algorithm that is both fast and accurate, even for models with many parameters. The proposed method approximates an ODE model with a state-space model based on the equations of a numerical solver, allowing for fast estimation by avoiding computations of the entire numerical solution in the likelihood. The posterior is obtained using a variational Bayes method, specifically the approximate Riemannian conjugate gradient method (Honkela et al."

We find that the differential conductance and induced pairing amplitudes strongly depend on the angle between the junction direction in real space and the axis separating the Weyl nodes in momentum space. We identify the influence of a chiral chemical potential, i.e., the electron population imbalance between Weyl nodes of opposite chirality, on the junction's transport characteristics. Remarkably, we observe a net spin polarization of Cooper pairs generated via Andreev reflection in the two WSM regions, which is opposite in the two regions and highly sensitive to the chirality imbalance and excitation energy."
221,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"Metal ion implantation into ceramics has been shown to be an effective and controllable technique for tailoring the surface electrical conductivity of a ceramic piece, and this approach has been utilized in various applications. Notably, it provides a method for grading the voltage drop across high-voltage insulators, thereby increasing the maximum operational voltage that can be applied across the insulator without surface flashover. However, a concern for using this method is the long-term stability of the implantation-induced conductivity, particularly if the implanted metal species is prone to oxidation. Here, we report on our examination of the long-term behavior of the surface conductivity of titanium-implanted alumina. The results indicate that after an initial drop of up to 40% in the first few weeks following implantation, the conductivity exhibits only a very slow decrease of approximately 10% over the subsequent year."
222,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"We introduce a novel Skyrme-like conserved current in the effective theory of pions and vector mesons, based on the concept of hidden local symmetry. The associated charge is equivalent to the skyrmion charge for any smooth configuration. Additionally, there exist singular configurations that can be identified as n_f=1 baryons charged under this new symmetry. Under this identification, the vector mesons play the role of Chern-Simons vector fields living on the quantum Hall droplet that forms the n_f=1 baryon. We propose that this current is the correct effective expression for the baryon current at low energies. This proposal provides a unified picture for the two types of baryons, allowing them to continuously transform into one another in a natural way. Furthermore, Chern-Simons dualities on the droplet can be interpreted as a result of Seiberg-like duality between gluons and vector mesons."
223,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"Interfacial spin-orbit coupling in Josephson junctions offers an intriguing way to combine anomalous Hall and Josephson physics in a single device. We study theoretically how the superposition of both effects impacts the transport properties of superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator/superconductor junctions. Transverse momentum-dependent skew tunneling of Cooper pairs through the spin-active ferromagnetic insulator interface creates sizable transverse Hall supercurrents, which we refer to as anomalous Josephson Hall effect currents. We generalize the Furusaki-Tsukada formula, initially established to quantify usual tunneling Josephson current flows, to evaluate the transverse current components and demonstrate that their amplitudes are widely adjustable by means of the spin-orbit coupling strengths or the superconducting phase difference across the junction. As a clear spectroscopic fingerprint of Josephson junctions, well-localized subgap bound states form around the interface."

(2020), that dipoles are as crucial to the dynamics of decaying two-dimensional turbulence as individual vortex cores, it is found that the kinetic energy of this flow is carried by elongated streams formed by the concatenation of dipoles. Vortices separate into two distinct families: small, fast-moving cores and larger, slowly moving ones that can be described as 'frozen' into a slowly evolving 'crystal'. The kinematics of both families differ significantly, with only the former exhibiting self-similarity. The latter is responsible for most of the kinetic energy of the flow, and its vortices form the dipoles and streams. Mechanisms for the growth of this slow component are discussed."

Often, the running time of quantum algorithms in this framework is characterized by the quantum hitting time, which is the time required by the quantum walk to find a vertex of interest with high probability. In this article, we provide improved upper bounds for the quantum hitting time that can be applied to several continuous-time quantum walk (CTQW)-based quantum algorithms. In particular, we apply our techniques to the glued-trees problem, improving the hitting time upper bound by a polynomial factor from O(n^5) to O(n^2 log n). Furthermore, our methods also help to exponentially improve the dependence on precision of the continuous-time quantum walk-based algorithm to find a marked node on any ergodic, reversible Markov chain by Chakraborty et al."

Dry (or ""loss-cone"") EMRIs, previously considered the main EMRI sources for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, are primarily produced by multi-body scattering in the nuclear star cluster and gravitational capture. In this letter, we highlight an alternative EMRI formation channel: wet EMRI formation assisted by the accretion flow around accreting galactic-center massive black holes (MBHs). In this channel, the accretion disk captures stellar-mass black holes initially moving on inclined orbits, and subsequently drives them to migrate towards the MBH, boosting the formation rate of EMRIs in such galaxies by orders of magnitude."

This problem falls into the new user cold-start category, which is crucial to a company's development and even survival. Existing works on user cold-start recommendation either require additional user efforts, such as setting up an interview process, or utilize side information, such as user demographics, locations, and social relations. However, users may be unwilling to participate in an interview, and side information on cold-start users is usually not available."

It has also been successfully applied in wireless communications, despite the fact that current radio systems are well-understood and optimal algorithms exist for many tasks. While some gains have been obtained by learning individual parts of a receiver, a more effective approach is to jointly learn the entire receiver. However, this often results in a challenging nonlinear problem, for which the optimal solution is infeasible to implement. To address this, we propose a deep fully convolutional neural network, Deeprx, which executes the entire receiver pipeline from frequency domain signal stream to uncoded bits in a 5G-compliant manner. We facilitate accurate channel estimation by constructing the input of the convolutional neural network in a specific manner, utilizing both data and pilot symbols."

A corpus of potential seeds often contains thousands of similar inputs, which can lead to wasted fuzzing effort due to exhaustive mutation from all available seeds. To address this, fuzzers are often equipped with distillation tools, such as afl-cmin, that select the smallest subset of seeds triggering the same range of instrumentation data points as the full corpus. Common practice suggests that minimizing the number and cumulative size of the seeds results in more efficient fuzzing, a hypothesis we explore systematically. We present the results of over 34 cpu-years of fuzzing using five distillation approaches to understand their impact on finding bugs in real-world software."

The agents can be divided into several groups, each with similar (isomorphic) state transition structures, allowing them to be relabeled into the same template. Based on this template, a scalable supervisor is designed, whose state size and computational cost are independent of the number of agents, for the case of partial observation. The scalable supervisor under partial observation does not require recomputation, regardless of the number of agents added to or removed from the system. We generalize our earlier results to partial observation by proposing sufficient conditions for safety and maximal permissiveness of the scalable least restrictive supervisor at the template level. An example is provided to illustrate the proposed scalable supervisory synthesis."

An efficient approach for ENF estimation is introduced, utilizing temporal windowing based on the filter-bank Capon spectral estimator. A type of Gohberg-Semencul factorization of the model covariance matrix is employed, leveraging the Toeplitz structure of the covariance matrix. Furthermore, this approach incorporates, for the first time in the field of ENF, a temporal window - not necessarily rectangular - at the stage preceding spectral estimation. Krylov matrices are utilized for fast implementation of matrix inversions. The proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in ENF estimation when a short time window of 1 second is employed in power recordings. In speech recordings, the proposed approach yields highly accurate results, balancing both time complexity and accuracy."

As a corollary, regularized regression estimators based on these reduced dimension spaces are also provided, ranging from classical principal component regression to sparse partial robust M regression. The package contains a set of classical and robust pre-processing utilities, including generalized spatial signs, as well as dedicated plotting functionality and cross-validation utilities.

Here, we studied the anomalous saturating effect of fluorescence in nitrogen vacancy defects in diamond. Fluorescence reduction was observed with high-power laser excitation, increasing the nonlinearity of the fluorescence emission and altering the spatial frequency distribution of the fluorescence image. We employed a differential excitation protocol to extract high spatial frequency information. By modulating the excitation laser's power, the spatial resolution of imaging was improved approximately 1.6 times compared to confocal microscopy. Due to the simplicity of the experimental setup and data processing, we expect this method can be used to improve the spatial resolution of sensing and biological labeling with defects in solids."
234,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"When random effects are correlated with sample design variables, the conventional approach of using individual survey weights (constructed to be inversely proportional to the unit survey inclusion probabilities) to form a pseudo-likelihood no longer yields asymptotically unbiased inference. We develop a weight-exponentiated formulation for the random effects distribution that achieves unbiased inference for generating hyperparameters of the random effects. We compare our approach with frequentist methods that rely on numerical integration, revealing that only the Bayesian method achieves both unbiased estimation with respect to the sampling design distribution and consistency with respect to the population generating distribution. Our simulations and a real data example from a survey of business establishments demonstrate the utility of our approach across various modeling formulations and sampling designs. This work serves as a culmination of recent efforts to integrate traditional survey estimation approaches with the Bayesian modeling paradigm, bridging the gap between these two rich but disparate subfields."

These main processes replace each other over a temperature range of approximately fifty degrees. Dielectric spectroscopy also enabled the distinction of two orientational relaxation processes: the first due to rotation of the side mesogenic groups, and the second associated with the motion of main chain segments."

Optimizing discrete hash bits remains a key focus in deep hashing methods. A common strategy employed in these methods involves adopting an activation function, such as $\operatorname{sigmoid}(\cdot)$ or $\operatorname{tanh}(\cdot)$, and minimizing a quantization loss to approximate discrete values. However, this approach may cause more and more hash bits to become stuck in the wrong saturated area of the activation functions, never escaping. We refer to this issue as the ""dead bits problem"" (dbp). Furthermore, existing quantization losses can exacerbate dbp. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective gradient amplifier that acts before activation functions to alleviate dbp."

The former is constrained by disappearing charged track searches at the LHC and by dark matter direct detection experiments, while the latter is constrained by existing multilepton collider searches. We find that a two-step electroweak phase transition involving a stable triplet with a negative quadratic term is ruled out by direct detection searches, while an unstable triplet with a mass of less than 230 GeV is excluded at a 95% confidence level."

The standard scenario assumes an initially circular and narrow belt of planetesimals at semi-major axis $a$, whose eccentricity is increased to $e_f$ after the gas disc has dispersed due to secular perturbations from an eccentric planet, resulting in a belt of width $2ae_f$. A minor modification of this scenario suggests that narrower belts can form if the planetesimals are initially eccentric, possibly resulting from earlier planet perturbations during the gas-rich protoplanetary disc phase. Alternatively, a primordial eccentricity could be caused by instabilities that increase the disc eccentricity, without requiring the presence of planets."

Here, we report on measurements of many-body modes in 1D gated wires using a tunnelling spectroscopy technique. We observe two separate Fermi seas at high energies, associated with spin and charge excitations, along with the emergence of three additional 1D 'replica' modes that strengthen with decreasing wire length.

To this end, we combined the kinematic information provided by Gaia for almost all galactic clusters, with the largest sample of cluster ages available after correcting for systematic errors.

In this paper, we identify a surprising consequence of popularity-based rankings: the fewer items reporting a given signal, the higher the share of overall traffic they collectively attract. This 'few-get-richer' effect emerges in settings with few distinct classes of items (e.g., left-leaning versus right-leaning news sources), where items are ranked based on their popularity. We demonstrate analytically that the few-get-richer effect occurs when people tend to click on top-ranked items and have heterogeneous preferences for item classes. Using simulations, we analyze how the effect's strength changes with varying assumptions about the setting and human behavior. We also experimentally test our predictions in an online experiment with human participants, yielding findings with important implications for understanding the spread of misinformation."

However, most pruning techniques essentially involve trade-offs between model accuracy and regularity, leading to impaired inference accuracy and limited on-device acceleration performance. To address this issue, we introduce a new sparsity dimension, namely pattern-based sparsity, which comprises pattern and connectivity sparsity, and achieves both high accuracy and hardware friendliness. With carefully designed patterns, the proposed pruning method consistently and unprecedentedly achieves accuracy enhancement and better feature extraction ability across different DNN structures and datasets. Our pattern-aware pruning framework also enables simultaneous pattern library extraction, pattern selection, pattern and connectivity pruning, and weight training. Our approach, based on the new pattern-based sparsity, naturally fits into compiler optimization for highly efficient DNN execution on mobile platforms."

Here we were, watching these incredible athletes, with amazing goals, clean and engaging games, and at the same time, outside the field, these women were advocating for equal pay, and in some countries, any pay at all for their sport. Since we were mildly obsessed, we wanted to watch the games live, and we decided that one of the Spanish-speaking networks in the US was the best place to start. It wasn't until a few games into the tournament that a friend of mine mentioned to me, ""Why does it feel like everything I'm seeing is commercials for makeup, household cleaning products, and diets?"
260,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,speech,"I want to tell you about the future of money. Let's start with a story about a culture that lived in Micronesia in the early 1900s, called the Yap. I want to tell you about the Yap because their form of money is really interesting. They use limestone discs called Rai stones. The Yap don't actually move these Rai stones around or exchange them the way we do with our coins, because Rai stones can be massive - the largest is about four tons and 12 feet across. So, the Yap just keep track of who owns part of what stone. There's a story about sailors who were transporting a stone across the ocean when they ran into trouble and the stone actually fell in."

If you insist on your innocence, you'll likely be found guilty and executed. However, if you confess, apologize, and implicate others, you'll go free. Do you give a false confession or risk a public hanging? This was the choice facing those accused of witchcraft in Salem, Massachusetts, between February 1692 and May 1693. They were the victims of paranoia about the supernatural, misdirected religious fervor, and a justice system that valued repentance over truth. Salem was settled in 1626 by Puritans, a group of English Protestants. Life was strict and isolated for the people of Salem, with battles against their Native American neighbors and groups of French settlers being commonplace."
262,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,speech,"There are currently hundreds of thousands of people on transplant lists, waiting for critical organs like kidneys, hearts, and livers that could save their lives. Unfortunately, there aren't nearly enough donor organs available to meet that demand. What if, instead of waiting, we could create brand-new, customized organs from scratch? That's the idea behind bioprinting, a branch of regenerative medicine currently under development. We're not yet able to print complex organs, but simpler tissues, including blood vessels and tubes responsible for nutrient and waste exchange, are already within our grasp. Bioprinting is a biological cousin of 3D printing, a technique that deposits layers of material on top of each other to construct a three-dimensional object one slice at a time."

I'll try to speak a little bit today about a phenomenon that can, and actually is, changing the world, and its name is people power. I'll start with an anecdote, or for those of you who are Monty Python lovers, a Monty Python-type sketch. Here it is: it's December 15, 2010. Somebody gives you a bet: you will look at a crystal ball and see the future; the future will be accurate, but you need to share it with the world. Okay, curiosity killed the cat, you take the bet, you look at the crystal ball. One hour later, you're sitting in a building of the national TV, in a top show, and you tell the story."

He's been christened the voice of a generation, and he's churning out classic songs at a seemingly impossible rate. However, there's a small minority of dissenters who claim that Bob Dylan is stealing other people's songs. Fast forward to 2004. Brian Burton, aka Danger Mouse, takes the Beatles' ""White Album,"" combines it with Jay-Z's ""The Black Album"" to create ""The Grey Album."" ""The Grey Album"" becomes an immediate online sensation, and the Beatles' record company sends out countless cease-and-desist letters for ""unfair competition and dilution of our valuable property."" Now, ""The Grey Album"" is essentially a remix."

I began with that sentence about 12 years ago, initially in the context of developing countries, but you're here today from every corner of the world. So, if you think of a map of your country, I think you'll realize that for every country on earth, you could draw little circles to identify places where good teachers are reluctant to go. Notably, those are often the places from which trouble originates. We have an ironic problem – good teachers tend to avoid the very places where they're needed the most. I started in 1999 to try and address this problem with a simple experiment in New Delhi."

Given that the majority of refugees live in urban areas, there is a strong need for a paradigm shift and new thinking. Rather than wasting money on building walls, it would be more effective to invest in programs that empower refugees to help themselves. (applause) We are often forced to leave behind all our possessions, but not our skills and knowledge.

These are two questions I always begin my poetry workshops with students, because at times, poetry can seem like a dead art form for old white men who appear to have been born old, like Benjamin Button. I ask my students these two questions, and then I share how I answer them, which is in these three sentences: I am the daughter of black writers, who are descended from freedom fighters who broke their chains and changed the world. They call me. These are words I repeat in a mantra before every single poetry performance. In fact, I was doing it in the corner over there, making faces."

269,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,speech,"On October 4, 1957, the world watched in awe and fear as the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the world's first man-made satellite, into space. This small metal ball, less than two feet in diameter, sparked a space race between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. that would last for eighteen years and change the world as we know it. Sputnik was not actually the first piece of human technology to enter space; that distinction belongs to the V-2 rocket used by Germany in missile attacks against Allied cities as a last-ditch effort in the final years of World War II. Although it was not very effective, at the end of the war, both the U.S. and U.S.S.R. had captured the technology and the scientists who had developed it, and began using them for their own projects."

But why? As I speak to you right now, more than 800 million women around the world are having a period. None of us would exist without it, and yet it remains an 'embarrassing' subject to broach. From my experience and that of the women around me, I can tell you that it's exhausting. It's exhausting to carefully take out a brown paper bag hiding a pad, stuffing it into your pocket in the middle of a class, and rushing to the washroom as discreetly as possible. It's exhausting to sit through lessons and meetings, pretending to be absolutely normal while internally crying out from intense period cramps."

It stretches across northern Canada, including Labrador, which is home to the largest remaining wild caribou herd in the world: the George River caribou herd, numbering approximately 400,000 animals. Unfortunately, when I was there, I couldn't find one, but the antlers serve as proof. Across the boreal, we're blessed with an incredible abundance of wetlands. Globally, wetlands are one of the most endangered ecosystems. They're absolutely critical, as they clean the air, clean the water, sequester large amounts of greenhouse gases, and are home to a huge diversity of species."

Four brothers wandered this celestial realm, having no family other than each other – they didn't even know who their parents were. One of the brothers, Deminan, looked different from the others; his skin was covered in painful scabs, and he wondered why he alone had been marked with this affliction. One day, while the Supreme Spirit Yaya was out in his gardens, Deminan and his brothers snuck into Yaya's house. After feasting and exploring, they spotted a giant gourd hanging in the corner, but as they tried to look inside, they dropped it."

I attended a career fair on campus, where I secured an interview with a start-up called Theranos. At the time, there wasn't much information about the company, but what was available was impressive. Essentially, the company was developing a medical device that would allow for a complete blood panel to be run from a finger-stick of blood, eliminating the need for a large needle to be inserted into the arm for blood tests. This was interesting not only because it was less painful, but also because it could potentially open the door to predictive diagnostics."

There, we lived with the Inuit in a tiny Inuit community of 200 people, where we were one of three non-Inuit families. In this community, we didn't have a television, computers, or radio, and we didn't even have a telephone. As a result, I spent all my time outside with the Inuit, playing. The snow and ice were my sandbox, and the Inuit were my teachers. That's where I became truly obsessed with the polar realm."

We receive individuals for whom all other options have been exhausted, people who have fallen through the cracks of every other social safety net. Since they can't be contained elsewhere, we must. Our role is to contain and control them. Over the years, as a prison system, as a nation, and as a society, we've become very skilled at this, but that's not something to be proud of. Today, we incarcerate more people per capita than any other country in the world. We currently have more black men in prison than were enslaved in 1850."

To do that, I need to explain something about the origin of the solar system. When we go back four and a half billion years, there was a cloud of gas and dust. In the center of this cloud, our sun formed and ignited. Along with that, what we now know as planets, comets, and asteroids formed. What then happened, according to theory, is that when the Earth had cooled down a bit after its formation, comets massively impacted the Earth and delivered water to it. They probably also delivered complex organic material to Earth, and that may have bootstrapped the emergence of life."

When we created our 'Build Back Better' series, our goal was to address the issues arising from the pandemic and imagine how to rebuild from it. However, the events of the past week, including the horrific death of George Floyd and the subsequent daily protests, have added a new sense of urgency that we must address. Can we build back better from this? I think before we can even begin to answer that question, we need to seek to understand the magnitude of this moment.

280,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,speech,"In 1903, the President of the United States took a three-day camping trip in California's Yosemite Valley. President Theodore Roosevelt slept in a grove of towering sequoia trees, camped in a snowstorm, and spent hours talking around the campfire with his host and guide, conservationist John Muir. Roosevelt famously loved the outdoors, but Muir had invited him there for more than just camping: Yosemite was in danger. Though Yosemite became protected land in 1864, the valley was still at risk of overdevelopment in 1903. It was at the heart of a decades-old struggle to set aside land for both preservation and public use – two goals that were much easier said than done. The battle over Yosemite began with the 1849 gold rush, when miners surged west, seeking gold in the Sierra Nevada foothills."

As a young reporter, I thought I should approach it differently to have maximum impact, since everyone knew it was happening, yet nothing was being done to stop it. So I decided to go undercover and act as a seller. As part of this, I was able to document hard-core evidence. The impact was great, fantastic.

A new drug prolongs the lives of patients with a rare disease. Health headlines like these are published every day, sometimes making opposite claims from each other. There can be a disconnect between broad, attention-grabbing headlines and the often specific, incremental results of the medical research they cover. So, how can you avoid being misled by grabby headlines? The best way to assess a headline's credibility is to look at the original research it reports on. We've come up with a hypothetical research scenario for each of these three headlines. Keep watching for the explanation of the first example, then pause at the headline to answer the question. These scenarios are simplified."

The experiment asks us to consider a world in which scientists have developed a machine that simulates real life while guaranteeing experiences of only pleasure and never pain. The catch: you have to permanently leave reality behind, but you'll hardly notice the difference. Your experiences will be indistinguishable from reality. Life's natural ups and downs will be replaced with an endless series of ups. Sounds great, right?"

288,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,speech,"Where does all the carbon we release go? Carbon works in a natural cycle, present in all living things: in the soil, in the oceans, in the atmosphere, and in rocks deep underground. When plants and other living things die, much of their stored carbon makes its way back to the atmosphere until new plants grow and reabsorb the carbon. However, over millions of years, some of the carbon stored in ancient trees and sea life becomes rock and some becomes fossil fuels: coal, oil, and natural gas. Natural events, such as volcanic eruptions, release some of the carbon trapped in rock. Meanwhile, human activities, like burning fossil fuels, also release some of that prehistoric carbon. Today, humans release around 60 times more carbon than all the volcanoes on the planet each year."

Yet one of the greatest differences between natural and human technologies lies in robustness. Robust systems are stable in complex and new environments. Remarkably, cockroaches can self-stabilize while running over rough terrain. When we put a jet pack on them or subject them to a perturbation like an earthquake, we discovered that their wonderfully tuned legs allow them to self-stabilize without using any brainpower. They can navigate complex terrain, such as grass, with ease and remain stable. We also discovered a new behavior where, due to their shape, they automatically roll onto their side to pass through a test obstacle, like a patch of artificial grass. Robust systems can perform multiple tasks with the same structure, and here's a new behavior we've discovered."

But what got me from there to here wasn't the punishment I faced as a teenager in adult prison or the harshness of our legal system.
