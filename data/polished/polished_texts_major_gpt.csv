1,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,blog,"Another week has flown by. Yesterday, I drove past the new house and saw that the front window was covered with boxes. We're eagerly anticipating receiving the keys at closing—I'm getting really excited! If everything goes smoothly this week, we'll be ready to close a week from Wednesday. Last night, I stayed up past 3:00 AM watching movies with Bethany. There's been a lot of movie watching happening here lately. Here's my recap: we watched ""Thirteen"" last night—a film every parent of a teenager should see. It surpassed my expectations. Then we watched ""Gigli,"" which lived up to its poor reviews, but we had to see it for ourselves."
2,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,blog,"Summer television used to be a wasteland filled with reruns, but now two exciting new shows have captured my attention. I've been watching both shows religiously over the past week. One of them, ""Blow Out,"" features an unexpectedly flamboyant concept with hardly any visible LGBTQIA+ representation. It follows hairstylist Jonathan Antin, who is aiming to open a second branch of his widely successful West Hollywood salon, this time in Beverly Hills. Ordinarily, I wouldn't be interested at all. However, while flipping through channels, I happened upon Jonathan, who, with a mix of vanity and monotony, gazed at an empty space on Rodeo Drive and declared, ""I am going to build here the greatest salon in the history of the world ever!"" Strangely, I was hooked. Not since ""Rocco"" have I found a character this compelling on television, despite their apparent foolishness."
3,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,blog,"What a week it's been... I'm dealing with tendonitis in my right shoulder, specifically under my shoulder blade. Whenever I overuse it, particularly with computer work, the pain is intense. At this point, I can hardly move my arm because I spent a lot of time updating my website and tackling other online tasks. Drawing takes much more effort now, and the lack of sleep only worsens the situation. While I'm not in the best spirits at the moment, I'm confident I'll recover soon. On a brighter note, my mom's surgery went well. Her eyesight is gradually returning; she can now discern fuzzy shapes and identify colors, although she remains significantly visually impaired. We're hopeful that she'll fully regain her vision soon."
4,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,blog,"The Kindness of Strangers... Today I attempted to do laundry with the kids and quickly discovered how even the simplest tasks can turn into daunting ordeals. Amidst the chaos, I also found out just how wonderfully kind strangers can be, expecting nothing in return other than the joy of being kind. Believe me, it wasn't like they were trying to impress me—I was disheveled, covered in kid drool, and wearing my trusty 'laundry day' attire. Plus, let’s just say my personal hygiene wasn't at its peak, so there was no scent-based motivation either! At this moment, I'm multitasking: writing this post while watching a collection of No Doubt music videos, all from the comfort of my desk in my room."
5,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,blog,"It's 11:14 PM MST, and here I find myself in my bedroom working on the computer of the personnel director from my job. I don't mind helping out, but I sometimes wonder why I so often end up fixing other people's computers as a favor. While I'm thankful to be able to support and care for others this way, I question where to draw the line before I'm being taken advantage of. Over the last couple of weeks, I've been staying up late reading and doing various activities, so I was looking forward to going to bed early tonight. However, I realized it would be more sensible to finish the computer repairs and return it to its owner. *laugh* No rest for the weary, right? So, I ended up watching Joe Schmo 2 again tonight."

Following our awkward lunch, my confidence wavered, and I realized I neglected to share a crucial part of the story with you all. Before Pat arrived for lunch, Dustin began talking about what a genuinely nice guy Pat is and mentioned his efforts to find him a girlfriend. As I listened and nodded, it became apparent that we were more focused on finding a match for Dustin's best friend than engaging in the typical conversation one might have with a stranger over pink lemonade. Excusing myself to the bathroom, I caught my reflection in the mirror and silently pondered: Am I being set up with someone else? Is this how things unfold now?"
7,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,blog,"I encourage everyone to be thoughtful before taking action. In fact, I wish that every person in the world would take a moment to reflect before even getting out of bed in the morning, and then commit to maintaining that level of thoughtfulness throughout the day. If someone isn't ready to do so, perhaps they should consider staying in bed and opting for a restful sleep instead. I'm genuinely frustrated with careless behavior. While I don't claim to be the smartest person, my concerns aren't about intellectual challenges but rather common sense. Therefore, I think it's reasonable to hold people accountable for thoughtless actions. Let's see if I can limit this particular discussion to a few specific groups and save others for another time. Sound good? Great."
8,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,blog,"There are two issues with the scenario I discussed in my previous post: 

1. While it is true that Bush is stimulating the economy, he is doing so inefficiently. Robert Rubin, during his interview on NPR’s Marketplace, suggested that Bush could have stimulated the economy just as effectively without incurring long-term debt by implementing different types of tax cuts. These could have been temporary cuts aimed at benefiting low and middle-income individuals. Ah, Robert Rubin—the mere mention of his name is music to our ears. Quickly, try to name a Bush administration domestic cabinet official with Rubin's level of influence. Still thinking? It might take a while...

2. We cannot afford to give Republicans control only during wartime, as they have cleverly created an unending, global ""war on terrorism."

Like when you're in math class, utterly bored, and you begin to wonder what processes in your brain enable you to understand math. You become aware of your own existence and question why you're there in that moment. It dawns on you how extraordinary it is just to be alive. Then, suddenly, you realize how ridiculous it is to be caught up in such a random train of thought. Has that ever happened to you? I really dislike it when it does. You know what else I can't stand? Block schedules. Who came up with that concept? It's obvious that sitting through a two-and-a-half-hour class on any subject is nothing short of cruel and unusual punishment."

This evening, Andy narrowly defeated me by a few dollars and claimed victory in the game. Perhaps I let him win, considering he's leaving in just a few hours and I wanted him to enjoy his last night here. Whatever the case, it pales in comparison to the massive headache I’m experiencing right now. I've taken some Aleve, which seems to be doing its job; all I need now is some well-earned rest and relaxation. It was your phone that helped me wrap the cord around your neck... At the drive-in."

We just returned home from Indiana, and I realize I need to be selective about what I share, as there's a lot to say but limited time and energy. To begin, I must mention that camp was incredible, far exceeding my expectations. Recently, God's influence in my life has been truly remarkable, prompting a significant personal transformation. Now, back to the start: we arrived at the Twiggs' house on Friday evening and stayed there until we left for camp on Monday. During our stay, we spent our time visiting the fair, attending church, watching a parade, shopping at Walmart, and enjoying movies."

However, I'd prefer to take care of it now instead of trying to fit it in during the first month of my surgery rotation. I'm feeling nervous, scared, and restless—basically, all the emotions one associates with not wanting to return to school. This is going to be an entirely new experience for me. As a perfectionist, I take pride in excelling at everything I do, but starting something new is always challenging. I dislike feeling like just a pawn (as I told Cassie, ""I'm going to be the only pawn on the chessboard who insists on moving like a knight"") and not understanding what's happening."
14,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,blog,"Arun Shourie discusses how the current Governor of Uttar Pradesh had, as early as 1996, forewarned of the looming threat of the emergence of a so-called ""third Islamic state"" in the region. T. V. Rajeswar, who previously led the Intelligence Bureau and now serves as the Governor of Uttar Pradesh, had anticipated this serious danger in a series of articles published in the Hindustan Times back in 1996. Shourie puts forth an important question by asking whether knowing that Rajeswar, rather than himself or Mr. Advani, authored these warnings makes them more credible. Alternatively, should we dismiss Rajeswar as a covert communalist unfit to continue as the Governor of Uttar Pradesh simply because he penned such forecasts?"
15,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,blog,"Attitude: bored; Mood: indifferent. I'm looking forward to tonight as it's been a long, hard day at work, leaving me almost no time to write for you, dear readers. It's encouraging to see Tigger, now known as Akcron, stepping up and sharing her thoughts. There's not much to report today, but yesterday I attended Shakespeare on the Green. It was a beautiful play, although I had to leave before the curtain call, which was disappointing. I hope to watch a full performance of a Shakespeare play someday. But I digress. Akcron is right about the shower problems—it's a nuisance. On a lighter note, you have to admit, watching someone struggle in the shower can be quite amusing, given the expressions people make during such moments of self-inflicted torture."

Last evening, I went home and immediately fell asleep, only waking when my mother called at around eight-thirty. When I awoke, the room was completely dark, as I hadn’t turned on any lights. For a few seconds, I was disoriented about the time and date, just my mother's voice guiding me back to reality. I wonder why I’m feeling so drained... The weather is pleasant this morning. It was drizzling as I arrived. Meanwhile, I've heard that in Calcutta, it has been raining for the last three days."
17,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,blog,"Last night was particularly frustrating. I ended up discarding the sweater I was working on, even though I had completed about 14 inches. I lost approximately $10 worth of yarn, with each skein costing $8. Unfortunately, by the time I reached the armholes, there were too many stitches, and the mohair kept tangling as I knitted. Trying to undo the rows, known as frogging, was ineffective because the yarn frequently snapped. Despite my usual tendency to swear in such situations, I remained surprisingly calm. Instead, I just listened to the second season of ""Sex and the City"" (thanks to my library) while I unraveled my work in a rather gloomy manner. Eventually, I grew tired and decided to throw it away. Looking back, I guess I can say I learned a lot from attempting to make this sweater."

The first chapter, ""Implacement,"" and the second, ""Displacement,"" delved into how our modern world emphasizes time as the key framework: we are constantly racing against time, trying to save it, or catching up just in time. Casey argues that centering culture around place fosters a more rooted community. (This is a brief summary, offered humbly in case my professor or any classmates read this post.) So far, this book is the first in our course that has truly captivated my interest."

While laughter is certainly enjoyable, one might question whether we would have ended up on that fire escape, drinking beer in the strong wind, had we not indulged in freeze pops earlier. As we found ourselves huddling in the doorway of a bar, sadly closed for the night, we paused to peruse an office-supplies catalog that had slipped through the mail. It was fortunate we did so. Who would have anticipated that tucked within its pages were the deals of a lifetime? Certainly not me.

Senate Republicans, let's see a show of hands—who tuned in for last week's 39-hour judicial nomination marathon? I must admit, I caught parts of it. This massive waste of time was orchestrated by Republicans upset that Democrats refused to simply nod along and approve four of Bush's extreme judicial nominees. Despite Democrats having already confirmed 168 of Bush's selections, this wasn't satisfactory for the Republicans craving power. They mistakenly believe they have a sweeping mandate for such antics."
21,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,blog,"This past weekend was truly enjoyable. I indulged in nature's finest greenery, listened to Nevermore—a band I wish I had explored much earlier—and spent much of my time reading. I managed to finish three books: Bruce Sterling's ""Heavy Weather,"" Larry Niven's ""World of Ptavvs,"" and Octavia Butler's ""Parable of the Sower."" ""Heavy Weather"" offered an engaging cyberpunk journey through a near-future United States plagued by global warming and chaos. The book was clever, well-paced, and convincing. However, I must admit that I didn't come away with a strong impression of the story or its characters. While both are well-developed and vividly described, the book struck me as good, but not exceptional."
22,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,blog,"The aftermath of returning from practicum has been challenging. During the first week, I struggled significantly, but it's in this second week that things have started to become clearer. The post-practicum distress seems to be a widespread issue that is just now gaining attention. I was deeply affected, but a meeting with the course coordinator provided relief. This meeting allowed me to voice my concerns and, in doing so, ensure that no one else would be placed in a similarly inadequate practicum environment. Yesterday, I encountered a distressed classmate who was adamant about warning another student scheduled for her previous school about its poor quality. I managed to calm her down, suggesting that it would be more effective to approach the administrator first."

I've discovered that I'm not very skilled at either 8-ball or ping pong! Rick, affectionately known as ""the Canuck,"" frequently defeats me. We have a ping pong table in the front lobby of our building, making it easy to squeeze in a 'quick round.' Last night, I took part in an 8-ball tournament at the recreation tent, our social hub complete with a popcorn machine, multiple TVs, a jukebox, DVD rentals, a pool table, a dartboard, and, of course, a ping pong table. I performed quite well through my game—up until I accidentally pocketed the cue ball while aiming for the eight ball.

I wasn't then, nor am I now, someone who naturally gravitates towards mathematics. In fact, I have a strong aversion to it. You get the picture: I am truly math-phobic. As I endeavored to unravel the mysteries of algebra, the doorbell unexpectedly rang. Reluctantly, I set down my book to answer the door, only to find no one there. Frustrated, I returned to my studies, and just as I began to grasp a fleeting moment of clarity, the doorbell disrupted my thoughts once more. Instantly, my fragile breakthrough vanished. Once again, I went to the door, and once again, no one was there. It was exactly what a struggling math student didn't need—an unwelcome prank."

If I had known about the move before the school year ended, I would have sorted through and discarded many of the books and supplies I no longer use. Unfortunately, everything accompanied me to the new room. Thus, this week was consumed by moving, unpacking, and extensive decluttering.

I am forever reminded of those rare nights we shared, when our hearts and bodies intertwined in a soulful embrace, enveloped by the salty darkness of an evening by the sea—or a kiss shared in the rain.

We embarked on a trek to the falls, which took about 30 minutes. The uphill walk left us breathless, but we persevered and reached our destination. The water was icy cold, enough to make our bodies feel numb. We didn't linger for long, less than an hour, before setting off to explore another nearby waterfall, involving another 30-minute hike. Although challenging, the journey was truly rewarding. The falls exuded a sense of tranquility, and the entire scene was breathtaking. It felt as though we were in harmony with nature. Immersing myself in the chilly water provided a profound connection to nature, and the cool air and water were soothing enough to lull anyone into a tranquil state."

After a recent argument I had with Nicole about Kelli, my parents wanted me to explain what was bothering me. Honestly, it's frustrating. I don't always have to share my troubles with them.

Alongside this development, a group of thirteen congressional Democrats, including four representatives from New York, has requested that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan send international observers to Florida to oversee this year's presidential voting. I respectfully disagree with this notion.

Just before leaving the event on June 29, an immigration official encouraged these new citizens to visit a voter registration table—an ordinary feature at such ceremonies. However, this table was different: Republican volunteers were distributing the forms, and the party affiliation box had already been pre-checked to register each new voter as a Republican.

I have some exciting news to share with you. Starting this Monday, I will be taking on the role of Project Lead for my current project. This change is happening because our current Project Lead will be heading onsite the day after tomorrow. I will be working closely with two onsite coordinators as well as managing a team of eight members.

Currently, I am busy with knowledge transfer plans. Another team of eight will collaborate with us, which is essential for the upcoming release, as it promises to be a significant one. On Monday, there will be a BS7799 security audit at Chennai Infy. We still have several areas that require fine-tuning at this stage, and I am hopeful that I will manage all these responsibilities smoothly.

Take care, and talk to you soon.

At 4:30 PM, my best friend Eric and his son Nunu arrived with a generous pan of baked ziti. The tables were prepared, the food I had cooked spread out, and the atmosphere was filled with excitement. To my delight, before I knew it, my dear friend from Florida, whom I had missed dearly, walked through the door.

As a non-American blogger, I've been hesitant to weigh in on certain debates, especially those concerning flags. However, given that I initiated the topic (though not the act of flag-burning), I should probably express my views. To begin with, I find the idea of enacting a law against flag-burning entirely irrational. When we start granting any symbol—regardless of its nature—an unquestioning reverence and legal protection, we take a significant step towards totalitarianism. Symbols are inherently ambiguous; they don’t intrinsically stand for anything. What matters is the meaning we assign to them or how they are perceived."

Unfortunately, too much focus seemed to be placed on the impressive set design rather than on establishing a cohesive tone or theme. While it retold the story effectively, I didn’t find it particularly engaging, nor did I feel that I gained anything from the experience. The character development was quite weak, in my opinion. Additionally, the musical score seemed lacking and felt like an imitation of the one in ""Gladiator.""

Hi Lynn,

Following our discussion yesterday afternoon, Reyna and I revisited the NSP Powerpac agreement. We were specifically searching for language that obligates us to reconcile for the customer, regardless of whether we were allocating storage on a particular gas day. In the current agreement (dated April 1, 2001), we couldn't identify any clause necessitating such action, but there's a possibility we might have missed or misunderstood something."

To: All PX Market Participants  
From: John Yurkanin, Chief Operating Officer

I am writing to address a critical issue affecting the PX Day Ahead Auction caused by recent rule changes implemented by the California ISO. The emergency tariff filing submitted last Friday has disrupted the continuity of our market operations. The introduction of both soft and hard caps has created a significant disconnect, posing unacceptable risks for all participants. Contrary to the ISO's intentions of decreasing real-time energy sales and procurement, this approach is likely to drive suppliers towards the more lucrative pricing opportunities offered by the ISO. In response, the PX is actively petitioning Terry Winter of the ISO to permit immediate submission of adjustment bids at any relevant price for already submitted schedules. We believe this is necessary to restore stability and ensure competitive market dynamics."

John Gillespie is leading the iBuyit initiative, so he might be the appropriate contact for further information. I have already left him a voicemail but have not yet received a response.

The schedule in effect from August 2000 to September 2000 results in a significantly higher commodity charge due to a lump sum reimbursement that SDG&E customers receive over those two months, leading to lower expected electric bills. If the lump sum reimbursement is excluded from the implicit energy component, the average from June 2000 to January 2001 is 6.2 cents, whereas the average implicit commodity from February 2001 to December 2001 is 7.3 cents. Overall, the average implicit commodity charge from June 2000 to December 2001 is 6.9 cents per unit. For deliveries starting on September 1, 2000, the average remains 6.9 cents."

Hi Guz,

I wanted to update you on my plans for the rehearsal dinner. Dahl probably won't be joining me there, and he'll likely meet up with Jones and the others. I'll most likely meet up with them—and you—after the dinner. Let's keep in touch; you can reach me on my cell at 206-660-6248.

Hi Pat,

Sounds good! I'll be working during the day on Friday. If Dahl isn’t going with you to the rehearsal dinner and all the associated events, I'll likely grab some drinks with friends after work. Feel free to join us. Either way, let's catch up once you're done with your commitments.

Hi Martin,

Following up on my previous email, the updates regarding the U.S. changes related to the act have been forwarded to Mark Evans for appropriate distribution.

Regarding your inquiry, there's no internal memo, but we do possess copies of memoranda from external law firms. Additionally, ENA has indeed revised its ISDA schedule form to include the ""eligible contract participant"" representation and line of business. I'll check with Susan Bailey to confirm whether these changes have been submitted to ECTRIC.

Greetings,

These past weeks have indeed been challenging for all of us. I hope that my daily updates are providing clarity on the latest developments within our company. Here’s a summary of last week’s important events:

We finalized a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney, securing additional credit lines of $1 billion. These will be supported by our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company. In total, we now have $4 billion in secured credit lines. This boost will help us pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain our liquidity.

Furthermore, our board of directors has welcomed a new member, William Powers, Jr., the esteemed Dean of the University of Texas School of Law in Austin.

Best regards,

The order outlines the possibility of $69 million in refunds, requiring either payment or cost justification. Although Enron is not listed among the 13 entities accused of overcharging, PGE is, with an allegation of $3.18 million. This is not the end of the matter. The order currently addresses only January 2001 and indicates that further directives will cover December 2000 and establish benchmark prices through April 2001. The pricing used to determine potential refunds was quite high, at $273/MWh, incorporating gas prices, emissions costs, and an assumed heat rate exceeding 16,000. Regarding sales to California, we have finalized at least one short-term transaction and held discussions with the California Department of Water Resources about longer-term agreements.

The fluidity of movement, absence of bugs or crashes, and abundance of engaging storylines and content make for an exceptional experience. Players have daily options, including multiple practice sessions, events like sponsorships, and actual games. This review focuses on the ""MyCareer"" mode, which I rate a perfect 10/10.

97,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"Attention Magic enthusiasts: Be cautious, as Wizards of the Coast appears reluctant to create a satisfying digital Magic: The Gathering experience. At its essence, the game is a social outlet crafted for camaraderie and competition—sharing laughs, playful banter, and triumphant victories with friends or friendly rivals. It seems that Wizards of the Coast has lost touch with this spirit. In the digital platform, playing with friends yields no gold, which is vital for progression in the game. Gold is so crucial that there's a daily earning limit, which makes sense, given that gold is the key to unlocking everything within the game. However, brace yourself for the tedious grind of 1v1 battles against either the computer or random opponents—with whom you can't communicate. Choosing the free-to-play path means enduring roughly four hours of solo play each day for over a month to gather the necessary cards."
98,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"As the third installment in the trilogy, I'll address the drawbacks first. I'm generally not a fan of prequels because they move backward in a narrative rather than advancing it (a common issue with all prequels). Nevertheless, they often add depth to the storyline. Unfortunately, the combat in this game feels less refined than the sharp mechanics achieved in Arkham City. At the time of writing this review (October 26, 2013), there's a game-breaking bug that prevents the completion of a side mission, although the main storyline remains unaffected. Additionally, some gadgets are assigned to impractical hotkeys, requiring you to stretch across the keyboard. This might not seem significant, but it can disrupt your combo in the heat of combat."
100,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"There were numerous issues that I encountered, making it difficult to even begin this review. All my concerns are related to MyCareer. My player is an outside scorer, a point guard standing at 1.71m, with maxed-out stats and all the necessary perks. Yet, can anyone explain why shooting ability seems to be influenced by height? How is it that a person who is 1.74m cannot excel at shooting like someone who is 1.71m? In real life, I am 1.87m tall, and when I created my first player at this height, I noticed that I couldn't achieve a shooting skill higher than 89. Why is this? It feels discriminatory! Moreover, why doesn't the game inform me of these limitations before I create a character, or even alert me when I hit the skill ceiling after weeks of playing?"
101,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"In my opinion, this installment of Assassin's Creed has perfected its mechanics across the board, from ship battles and sailing to hunting and parkour. I found myself much more invested in this particular character. Although the story begins on a shaky note, it significantly improves as you progress, which I feel is a common trait in every Assassin's Creed game. Edward, along with the side characters, was truly captivating. The collectibles in this game felt meaningful, unlike in any previous iterations, perhaps because they seemed to serve a greater purpose within the game. While not essential, they were enjoyable to collect, and the rewards were well-balanced."
102,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"While I wouldn't personally recommend this game, it wasn't entirely awful either. The gunplay holds up well, as long as you have the funds to buy gun parts. This highlights my primary issue with the game: it's heavily reliant on a pay-to-win model. If I could overlook that aspect, the game would actually be quite enjoyable. The hardsuit is a blast to use, and the HRV feature is a fantastic concept. I would choose this game over any Call of Duty title anytime, but its pay-to-win microtransaction approach is discouraging for me. If you're comfortable with this model, feel free to enjoy it. However, if you're like me and dislike pay-to-win games, it's best to pass on this one; it simply isn't suited to our preferences."
103,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"Although not without its flaws, this game has provided a highly enjoyable experience. The save system and the potential for sudden character death can be frustrating. During my first playthrough, I lost my main character around the 10-hour mark of a 20-hour game. I would have appreciated having a save point to restart from at that moment. To address this, I've started using a third-party mod or save tool to prevent such setbacks. Additionally, the aiming reticle feels a bit too small, and the zoom feature could be more powerful. Despite these issues, the game has been a thrilling ride. While I don't usually gravitate towards zombie-themed games, the blend of strategy, missions, and the first-person shooter/beat 'em up elements is fantastic. I find myself playing whenever I can, always tempted to complete just one more mission or make one more supply run—or sometimes escaping to a safe spot before I log out."
104,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"This strategy game is truly exceptional! Having played every other war game, including European Escalation and ALB, I can confidently say this one fits in seamlessly. The sheer number of units available is impressive, and while I can't pinpoint the exact count, there are a vast amount to choose from! The graphics are stunning, the audio is immersive, and overall, the gameplay is nothing short of epic. Even the in-game chat box at the main menu is surprisingly entertaining. However, for those who expect an 'easy' experience or are new to the strategy genre, be prepared for a learning curve. Don't be discouraged by losses; you will lose many units. Just ensure you plan strategically, and always include anti-air and anti-tank defenses."
105,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"Initially, I had a negative bias towards this game and was hesitant to purchase it. The concept of a portal gun and portals struck me as peculiar, even though I'm a fan of science fiction. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The humor and voice acting in this game are outstanding—absolutely remarkable. Although there's an occasional hint of cheesiness, each character possesses a distinct sense of humor and personality, adding depth to the story. The level design is simply spectacular. I must mention that I never played the first Portal game, but after experiencing the sequel, I am now considering making time to play it someday. Had it not been for the sequel, I might never have given it a try."
107,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"For those in their thirties, especially in the UK, this is a delightful trip down memory lane. It hearkens back to the days of enduring the often-aggravating Timmy Mallett just to catch the five-minute Transformers cartoon segment. Familiar voices like Optimus Prime, Megatron, and Bumblebee make their return, instantly sparking recognition. The iconic transformation sound from the cartoons is faithfully recreated. Visually, the cel-shaded graphics are spot on, perfectly capturing the essence of Generation One. Beyond nostalgia, this is an incredibly enjoyable game with expertly crafted combat mechanics. Transforming during battles is frequently necessary and seamlessly integrated into combos, offering a unique experience compared to High Moon's outstanding War for Cybertron and Fall of Cybertron games. Additionally, there is a significant emphasis on melee combat, although certain foes, such as the Seekers, necessitate switching to ranged blasters for effective engagement."
109,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"This game offers stunning 4k resolution at 60fps with a GTX 970, includes dual audio options, and comes with Neptune gear—what's not to like? Check out the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nygsb617tmo. It’s an excellent port and a perfect starting point for newcomers to the series. Be aware, though, that there is a significant amount of dialogue, which you can skip if you prefer. While I recommend using a gamepad for the best experience, I personally encountered no issues with a keyboard and mouse setup, both of which are fully customizable. The pricing feels reasonable, and I would have been satisfied even if I had purchased it outright. More than half of the DLC is included for free, offering plenty to enjoy. I highly recommend this game to fans of JRPGs, anime, and visual novels, so long as you’re okay with longer intermissions between the action. Cheers!

110,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"From the very beginning, I encountered no performance issues with this game, even at its initial release. With all the subsequent patches, it plays exceptionally well. In my opinion, it's an incredibly fun and engaging game, despite some aspects that might be a bit irksome—such as the city area that repopulates with new enemies every time you advance the story. I found particular enjoyment in the 'dual play' segments, where you can control Batman alongside another character. The option to switch between a controller for most game segments and a mouse and keyboard for the tank combat segments was a much-appreciated feature. Navigating the Batmobile through the free-roam city, especially during pursuits of the APC commanders, becomes quite delightful. Once you've mastered using the brakes to skid around corners, driving around the city becomes a truly gratifying experience."
112,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"English isn't my first language; I'm Dutch. Please excuse any typos or grammatical errors in my review of this fantastic game. I'll break down this review into several categories: graphics, controls, sound, gameplay, and replayability.

**Graphics:** The game is designed in a comic-like style, which works perfectly. The graphics are clean and well-defined, with no unnecessary details, and the color schemes are pleasing. You can set the graphics to 'high' without putting a strain on your system. I play the game on an i5 Pentium processor with an NVIDIA GeForce 710M card and 8GB of memory, and it runs flawlessly on Windows 8.1.

**Controls:** The game can be played using a keyboard and mouse or an Xbox controller, offering flexibility in how you choose to interact with it."
114,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"After spending two hours immersed in this game, I find myself thoroughly entertained. It's incredibly funny, with robust gameplay, stunning art design, and unexpectedly high-quality and fitting music. The story and world are captivating, and the puzzles offer enjoyable challenges. However, what truly sets this game apart is its comedic brilliance. If you've experienced any RPGs since the genre's inception, you'll appreciate the clever jokes, parodies, and references that fill the game. Even newcomers to RPGs will likely find the humor delightful. For fans of classics like Final Fantasy 7 or X, this is a must-play. Without revealing too much, I had to take a break after two hours because I couldn't stop laughing and smiling. What a joy this game has been so far."
115,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"I genuinely apologize, as I always try to support free-to-play games and indie developers. However, I did not enjoy this game. Its description seemed perfect for me, but the execution was lacking. Although I am a fan of puzzle and exploration games, I found this one to be entirely unintuitive. Even after searching for ways to progress, the gameplay itself failed to engage me. Additionally, the absence of a pause button—or my inability to find one—is a significant flaw, considering many sequences are timed. Furthermore, the game feels more like a series of cut scenes than actual gameplay, leaving me frequently tapping my fingers in boredom."
116,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"This game left me breathless; I hardly know where to begin. The experience was stunning, captivating me from the story to the graphics. It wasn't just a narrative; it truly immersed me, making me feel part of the character's journey, unraveling what awaited in the tale they were weaving. The gameplay was exceptional, and I discovered so much about myself—especially my unexpected fear of heights, which became apparent in the chilling ice caverns. My heart raced constantly, but my determination to support Uncle Fred pushed me onward. Should you ever release a DLC or a sequel, I'd be the first to purchase it and wholeheartedly recommend it to everyone I know. My deepest thanks to everyone involved in creating this masterpiece; you've crafted an utterly beautiful game."
117,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth is a turn-based strategy game where your objective is to develop your civilization to achieve specific goals or 'victories'. Unlike the previous installments, which unfolded against Earth's historical timeline—covering eras like the Stone Age, Medieval Age, and the Modern Age—this game is set in a futuristic scenario where your mission is to colonize a new planet. What I particularly appreciate about this game is that 2K Games took a fresh approach by implementing innovative mechanics such as the affinity system and the orbital layer. However, I found that these new mechanics could sometimes make the game feel a bit overwhelming. An area where I believe the game could be enhanced is by incorporating new artwork, particularly in the environments you encounter during interactions with other leaders."
118,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"Fantastic game! It offers an incredible amount of replayability and is an immensely enjoyable zombie survival experience. It definitely ranks among my top five zombie games I've ever played. After spending over 60 hours with it, I can confidently say that it's one of the most ""realistic"" zombie games out there. The game is crafted in the style of survival horror, requiring you to conserve ammo, treat your injuries, and take medication when infected, among other aspects. Additionally, the zombies are impressively animated, especially considering it's a free-to-play game. Note: I highly recommend playing with one or two friends for the best experience, though the community is very welcoming, and you can often make new friends or chat with others in the game via text or voice communication."
119,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"February 7, 2014 - It's unfortunate that I can't wholeheartedly recommend or enjoy this game. From the brief time I've played, I can tell I'd be hooked if it weren't for two major issues. First, the absence of Australian servers is a significant problem. Playing with a single red connection bar puts you at a severe disadvantage and results in unbearable lag. Incredibly, I even experienced stuttering and lag during the offline training mode (how does that even happen?). Combine this with poor ping, and it completely ruins the gameplay experience. Secondly, there's a severe issue with graphical artifacts affecting everything, from menus and backgrounds to training and in-game visuals. I've never encountered this problem with my current graphics card setup. I initially thought it might be due to my overclocked settings, but reverting my GPU to its default state made no difference."
120,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"Late last night, I completed this. While the plot itself isn't particularly deep or captivating, the storytelling truly sets it apart. The atmosphere is richly immersive, and the numerous collectibles significantly enhance the experience. I gained quite a bit of insight into the Batman universe, but I was a bit disappointed by the limited number of bosses in the game. However, this seems like a great opportunity for future installments to address. The combat strikes a good balance in terms of challenge, leaning slightly towards the easier side. Upgrading Batman himself isn't the most satisfying aspect, but enhancing and acquiring gadgets throughout the campaign introduces refreshing new gameplay mechanics. Plus, accessing previously unreachable areas contributes to a rewarding sense of progression."
121,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"To the Moon"" transcends being just a game; it is an unforgettable experience, ranking among the most impactful of my life. If you found Telltale's ""The Walking Dead"" to be poignant, prepare yourself—""To the Moon"" surpasses it in every way. Never have I felt so crestfallen yet simultaneously fulfilled by a fictional narrative. In my view, this work stands as a pinnacle of storytelling, complemented by an exquisitely charming and fitting soundtrack. Although the controls can be a bit cumbersome and the gameplay isn't its strongest suit, the story is so captivating that these issues seemed insignificant to me. The game also excels in humor, which is seamlessly woven into the narrative without detracting from its profound nature. And, for fans, there are endless references to Doctor Who to be enjoyed."
122,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"Bastion is an exceptionally captivating game with a compelling storyline. Set in the aftermath of a mysterious calamity, your journey begins with rebuilding the bastion. The game offers a plethora of choices that influence your progress, including decisions on construction for strategic advantages, selection of weapons and their enhancements, as well as choosing tonics that grant bonus effects. The art style and soundtrack are remarkable, infusing the post-apocalyptic world with vibrant colors, proving that the end times need not be drab. A standout feature is the dynamic narration, which reacts to your actions as a player. For instance, if you choose to replace one weapon with another at the armory, the narration adapts to reflect your decision, further immersing you in the game."
123,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"I initially purchased this game during its early development phase, back when ""spacebux"" was the sole currency and there wasn't a ""tech tree."" At that time, the game truly shone. The weapons were all equally overpowered, which eliminated any issues of imbalance—any player could defeat any other at any moment. Additionally, the game used to offer unlimited gun slots and five loadouts. Considering the game's premise of featuring ""bajillions of guns,"" you would expect it to provide more than just six weapon slots and three loadouts before requiring additional payment to unlock more. I once had an arsenal spanning three pages and was brimming with new ideas for expansion, as that was where I personally found the excitement and enjoyment."
124,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"This game turned out to be an unexpected treasure. Although rave reviews can sometimes exaggerate a product's appeal, in this instance, they truly capture the enjoyment this delightful little game offers. It uniquely combines elements of a classic 2D platformer with those of a MOBA, pulling it off with flair. To my surprise, I enjoyed playing characters that I'd typically overlook in other MOBA games. Initially, I thought this might not extend to all character types, but I decided to try a melee tank nonetheless. I was pleasantly surprised by the experience, which motivated me to explore more characters as I unlocked them through gameplay. The art style and interface possess a peculiar charm that captivated me. I even adopted one of the characters as my avatar and chose a game-related wallpaper after creating a card set."
125,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"I've just started playing this game, and I absolutely love it. With my headphones on, I completely immerse myself for hours at a time. It's been a long time since a game has captivated me like this. The music perfectly sets the atmosphere, the sound effects are spot on, and the controls function flawlessly. I eagerly anticipate each combat encounter, and the developers have done an excellent job optimizing it. I had my reservations about the naval combat system, but now I thoroughly enjoy decimating multiple fleets simultaneously. The only way to lose in this game is by failing to retreat. If the combat becomes too intense, just pull back, regroup, and launch a counter-offensive. Thank you, developers, for creating such an amazing experience!"
126,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"The reboot of the Devil May Cry franchise has introduced significant changes, particularly affecting the series' protagonist, Dante. Although long-time fans might feel uneasy about the transformation of their cherished character, these changes are undoubtedly beneficial, as demonstrated by Ninja Theory's new game. DmC provides an excellent entry point for newcomers to the series. It explores the beginnings of a once cynical and arrogant Dante, detailing his evolution from self-interest to selflessness. The game skillfully crafts a clear narrative arc for this reimagined Dante, making him an intriguing character to follow. The story follows Dante as he is drawn into the corrupt world he had previously chosen to ignore."
127,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"Where do I begin with this truly magnificent game? Its story is irresistibly charming, filled with rich details and bursting with joy, clever humor, playful dogs, and hidden surprises. It expertly balances seriousness with humor, offering funny moments when least expected. The character design is exceptional, featuring a diverse array of personalities, each with their own secrets. What truly sets this RPG apart is the unique concept of not having to kill anyone—an unprecedented approach in the genre. Drawing significant inspiration from EarthBound, one of the finest RPGs out there, this game quickly distinguishes itself as a standout experience. Moreover, it boasts an unforgettable soundtrack, among the best I've heard in years."
128,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"I'm recommending this only because it's free and might offer a more enjoyable experience for others. In my experience, however, the game fell flat. Half of its narrative relies heavily on shock value, which neither surprised nor emotionally affected me. This could be due to my own desensitization, or perhaps the content was too simplistic to evoke a response. The other half of the game attempts to portray the mental decline of a character, dealing with themes like obsession, hallucination, and depression, which is intriguing in concept. Yet, the entire experience lasted just 10 minutes, even with my thorough engagement in reading and absorbing every detail."
129,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"Let me tell you why ""Portal"" is such a remarkable game. As a puzzle game, it introduces an intriguing concept and then lets you explore it on your own. It's a brilliant way to challenge your intellect while still ensuring you have a great time. Even though it doesn't focus heavily on narrative, ""Portal"" laid the groundwork for one of the most celebrated games of 2011. I still find myself revisiting it whenever I'm bored, enjoying the experience of reliving a true classic. 

In terms of gameplay, ""Portal"" is elegantly straightforward. You use portals to navigate and solve puzzles, incorporating buttons that activate various elements in the puzzles. These buttons come in two types: one that you simply press and another that requires a cube to engage."
130,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"If you can overlook the bugs—which, for me, were just two: one minor and one more annoying (both of which have now been fixed, significantly increasing my FPS from 60-90 to 80-120)—I wholeheartedly recommend this as a space exploration game. I noticed that many reviews focus on system specifications, so here are mine: Intel i5 6600k processor (approximately €200), Radeon RX480 graphics card (approximately €200), Z170 Pro-Gaming motherboard (approximately €150), and 16GB of DDR4 RAM (approximately €70), totaling around €650. This set-up is definitely in the mid-range price category, and it’s relatively new. I’m experiencing almost constant 60+ FPS with high settings and V-Sync enabled. I honestly find it hard to believe that 90% of the comments claim to have an overkill setup but still achieve only 20 FPS."
131,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"Do you remember ""Age of Mythology?"" It's been quite a while since we've seen an RTS game of similar caliber. However, Divinity: Dragon Commander comes remarkably close to being one of my personal favorites in the RTS genre. It combines this with an expansive, Risk-like grand strategy mode that perfectly complements the experience. I strive to remain objective, but it's hard not to be impressed by a game that lets you transform into a dragon, assisting your troops through support, attacks, and even directing unit production, movement, and spawning simultaneously. While I appreciate the complexity of modern RTS games like Civilization V, these titles often try to pack numerous intricate mechanics, graphs, and resources into a single, convoluted gameplay mode."

This doesn't even touch upon its world-building, characters, storyline, and gameplay, all of which deserve extensive praise. In short, if you enjoy RPGs, you should play this game. If you're a fan of video games, you must play this game. If you can spare seven hours in your life, make the time to play this game."

The game's mechanics have a rather steep learning curve, which I'm still working to understand; however, this complexity provides a wide array of strategic options to achieve goals and capitalize on situations. In my opinion, the game offers almost endless replayability. I find myself thoroughly engaged in every session I play, regardless of how the playthrough is progressing."

One significant advantage of Warframe is the dedication of its developers, who frequently release updates that introduce substantial content, including sweeping system changes, new Warframes, and additional features and tweaks. While Warframe is enjoyable for casual play, it may not maintain your interest for more than a few months unless you genuinely enjoy grinding. The silver lining is that the game is free, making it worthwhile to give it a try. If you're seeking a quick gaming experience, it's definitely worth exploring."
136,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"This game is incredibly dull. I purchased it thinking it was a PC version of 'Katamari Damacy', the beloved PS2 classic, but unfortunately, it falls far short of that expectation. The concept involves rolling up increasingly larger objects to grow bigger, but the gameplay lacks fluidity, the levels aren't creative, and the overall experience is like a bizarre horror show. It's not the entertaining kind of horror; rather, it leaves you feeling unsettled and questioning the very essence of life. Every creature in the game, from small animals to humans, feels lifeless, leading me to wonder if the developers had an interest in taxidermy."

I thought, ""Wow, a game exploring the road to the presidency? That sounds intriguing!"" Unfortunately, it didn’t quite meet my expectations. The game begins by asking you to choose between the Republican and Democratic parties, with no option for an independent or third-party candidate. Despite my slight disappointment, I remained hopeful and decided to proceed to explore what the game had to offer. I must admit that while the character customization is somewhat limited, it's quite entertaining to experiment with. It’s the only time in a campaign setting where you can humorously decide whether to wear your head or not."

What I liked:
- The visuals were impressive, particularly up until the final level set in the ice caves.
- While the story isn't particularly strong, the ending scene after the credits somewhat justified my investment of time in the game.

What I disliked:
- The visuals in the last level are rather dull.
- The gameplay in the final level becomes excessively challenging, leading to frustration as it requires repeated attempts to succeed.
- The achievements are overly difficult—only 13 out of 15 have been achieved by less than 2.1% of players."
140,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"Pros: The graphics are impressive.

Cons: The game has several issues. Bugs are prevalent, particularly in the environment, which can cause your character to get stuck or result in your shots hitting invisible barriers despite having a clear line of sight to the enemy. The gameplay feels overly guided, offering too much handholding. The artificial intelligence appears poorly designed, and enemies always seem to know your location once you're spotted. Their accuracy is unrealistically perfect, reminiscent of the frustrating precision seen in the first Ghost Warrior game. The checkpoint and save system is poorly implemented, and the story is dull and uninspiring. I wouldn’t recommend this game unless it’s heavily discounted—at least 90% off. Even then, playing it feels like a tedious chore, endured only to move on to another game in my collection. Given the time I found myself stuck in the first Ghost Warrior (which was equally monotonous, providing relief only upon its completion), I doubt I'll play this one through to the end."

However, during the brief period I was able to play, I found it enjoyable. As the Steve Miller Band song goes, ""Go on, take the money and run..."" [Link to song: https://youtu.be/-wcfugcollu?t=54]

English Review:
After just 73 minutes of gameplay, I was hooked! This game is incredible. Some weapons are overpowered, and the matchmaking can be uneven at times, but compared to Battlefield 3, it's not as bad. In Battlefield 3, the matchmaking would unfairly pit new players against high-level ones, who didn't seem human as shooting them in the face had no effect!"
143,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"I can certainly understand why others enjoy this game, but it simply didn't resonate with me. Owning a Vive, I prefer games that utilize a room-scale setup with controllers. Although the game's vast universe is initially awe-inspiring, I found its size to be more of a hurdle than an asset. The steep learning curve and the considerable time investment required to experience anything captivating at the start were off-putting for me. Perhaps if I had more patience and gaming time, I might find it engaging. However, since I lack both, I’d prefer to explore other VR games instead."
144,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"This is unquestionably my all-time favorite first-person shooter game. It's not designed for those who enjoy reckless, run-and-gun tactics. The recoil and ballistics are incredibly realistic. A single bullet to the chest, neck, or head from a rifle-caliber weapon usually results in death, unless it's just a graze. Bullets drop over long distances, and maintaining accuracy requires short, controlled bursts. There's no infinite supply of ammunition—you'll end up with partially filled magazines if you consistently reload halfway through. Sprinting endlessly isn't possible either; after running for a while, your aim will falter as you catch your breath. To improve steadiness, rest your weapon on your elbows while prone or use a window sill for support when aiming. Standing accuracy is less reliable."
145,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"I must start by mentioning that I didn't buy the game ""EU"" when it was initially released. Instead, I got it during a sale that also included ""EW,"" so I didn't encounter the same issues some players reported with the game. I really enjoyed it; the game was challenging in the beginning but very rewarding once you mastered it. As for ""XCOM 2,"" I absolutely love it. The game runs smoothly for me on medium settings, and I'm using a GTX 560 with 2GB of VRAM. Initially, the game defaulted to high settings, and it ran a bit sluggishly—not enough to be unplayable, but noticeable. When I switched to medium settings, everything ran smoothly. I might just be fortunate with my gaming experiences, but it seems to me that a lot of the negative reviews are coming from people with unrealistic expectations."
146,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"The game offers a compelling RPG leveling system, a wide array of ship types, and physics-based movement for both ships and projectiles. It features easy-to-master resource management and a dark sense of humor. However, it can become grind-heavy if you don't make the most of the civilian station types, and the AI teammates are somewhat lacking. There's a limited variety of equipment and leveling skills, with no branching paths. Nevertheless, this game is immensely enjoyable. Despite its drawbacks, there is ample room for strategy and variety. It starts off at a fast pace and continues to be engaging. Although the equipment range is limited, there's always a new ship to unlock or skill to enhance. To extend the game's lifespan, mods are a key component. ""Fight for Universe"" is a standout, but ""Big Fight for Beef"" is also a great addition."

While many still retain their landlines due to lower call charges, the majority of participants believe that the future lies with mobile technology. The Nokia-sponsored study also highlighted that mobile and fixed-line phones serve different functions: landlines are favored for longer conversations, whereas mobile phones are preferred for shorter chats, particularly with friends. In the UK, 69% of respondents reported choosing their landline for calls as it remains more cost-effective than using a mobile phone."

Meanwhile, AVs that pursue user equilibrium, along with human-driven vehicles, will incur congestion charges. We approach this issue through a bi-level optimization model. The upper level focuses on optimizing dynamic tolls, while the lower level employs a mixed equilibrium simulation for dynamic traffic assignment, accommodating both AVs and human-driven vehicles."

This advancement not only brings larger, more tangible objects into the realm of quantum behavior but also inspires the use of mechanical oscillators for processing and communicating quantum information and for serving as precision force sensors that surpass the standard quantum limit. However, the primarily linear interaction between motion and light or electricity limits access to a wider range of quantum states of motion, such as cat states or energy-squeezed states. Early optomechanical theories suggested that this limitation could be overcome by establishing strong quadratic coupling between motion and light. Although there have been experimental demonstrations involving quadratically coupled optomechanical systems, they have yet to reach nonclassical states of motion."

Capturing these spamming strategies is challenging as they evolve rapidly, vary between spammers and products, and are often unknown. Moreover, most current detection techniques prioritize accuracy but do not necessarily uphold the reliability of product evaluations. To solve these issues, we propose a minimax game framework where spammers and spam detectors tactically compete, focusing on pragmatic objectives beyond mere detection accuracy. The Nash equilibrium of this game yields stable detection systems that are robust against any combination of detection methods."
202,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,paper_abstract,"We have developed single-shot shaped pulses designed for ultra-high fidelity (uh-fidelity) population transfer within a three-level quantum system configured in a lambda arrangement. To achieve high fidelity, we employ the Lewis-Riesenfeld (L-R) method to derive a family of solutions that facilitate exact transfer, ensuring that these solutions adhere to a single dynamical mode of the L-R invariant. From this family, we identify a tracking solution characterized by a single parameter, which effectively controls the fidelity of the transfer, the population within the excited state, and the robustness of the system. We define the robustness of an uh-fidelity transfer as the minimum percentile deviation in pulse areas that results in infidelity exceeding $10^{-4}$. Our shaped pulses demonstrate superior robustness compared to Gaussian and adiabatically-optimized pulses when considering moderate pulse areas."

Due to the function's nonconvex nature, many local minima exist, which are suboptimal on a global scale, even in scenarios where the mixture components are clearly distinct. We demonstrate that all local minima possess a consistent structural form that partially identifies the true mixture's component centers. Specifically, each local minimum involves either fitting multiple Gaussian distributions to a single true component or fitting one Gaussian distribution to multiple true components without overlap. Our findings are applicable when the true mixture components meet a specific separation criterion and remain relevant whether the number of components is overestimated or underestimated. For Gaussian mixtures comprising three components, we achieve more precise outcomes regarding the separation scaling between the components."

A commonly used method to identify entanglement is through an entanglement witness, where measuring the witness operator is always positive for separable states but can turn negative for certain entangled states. However, as the system size increases, the dimension of the Hilbert space expands exponentially, making it particularly challenging to design an efficient entanglement witness for general multipartite entangled states. When dealing with $n$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-like states, the most resilient witness approach requires $n+1$ local measurement settings and can endure up to $1/2$ white noise. In contrast, the most efficient witness for GHZ-like states only necessitates two local measurement settings and can withstand up to $1/3$ white noise."
208,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,paper_abstract,"In the framework of general relativity, the Kerr spacetime represents the sole stationary solution for an isolated black hole, characterized by a distinct multipolar structure determined solely by its mass and spin. We have developed a comprehensive method to extract the multipole moments of any stationary spacetime and have applied this to a broad range of horizonless microstate geometries. These geometries can disrupt the axial and equatorial symmetry found in the Kerr metric, resulting in a far more intricate multipolar structure. This complexity offers a means to impose phenomenological constraints on fuzzball models. Our numerical results suggest that all multipole moments are typically larger (in absolute terms) than those of a Kerr black hole with equivalent mass and spin. While current measurements of the quadrupole moment in black-hole candidates impose only minimal restrictions on fuzzballs, future gravitational-wave observations of extreme mass-ratio inspirals by the LISA space mission will significantly tighten these constraints."

Often, long-term edges are manually defined by humans, which can be costly to establish and may not always be optimal for subsequent analysis. To address these challenges, we introduce a model that combines temporal point processes with variational autoencoders to understand temporal attention between nodes based on their communication patterns. By using the dynamics of node interactions, this method enhances flexibility and resolves issues related to manually defined edges, as temporal attention influences how features are propagated between nodes."

This analysis is applicable for probe frequencies both far from and near the dielectric band edge. The PCW was specifically designed for near-field atom trapping, and this study lays the groundwork for assessing potential adverse effects of thermal motion on optical atomic traps located close to the waveguide surfaces. Our long-term objectives include creating robust atom-mediated interactions between individual vibration phonons and single photons traveling in the PCW’s guided modes, thus paving the way for quantum-level opto-mechanical systems integrating atoms, photons, and phonons."

In this framework, the equivariant stable homotopy groups of any global spectrum organize into a global Mackey functor, making the splittings instrumental in breaking down certain long exact homotopy group sequences into shorter exact sequences. In the case of the real and complex global Thom spectra, denoted as $\mathbf{mo}$ and $\mathbf{mu}$, these splittings affirm the consistency of various Euler classes associated with the tautological representations of $o(n)$ and $u(n)$."

214,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,paper_abstract,"Density-based clustering is built on the concept of connecting groups to specific characteristics of the probability distribution that underlies the data. By referring to the true, albeit unknown, population structure, the clustering problem can be cast into a standard inferential framework. Within this framework, the notion of an ideal population clustering is defined as the partition created by the true density function. The nonparametric approach to this idea, known as modal clustering, links the groups to the domains of attraction of the density modes. In practice, this requires a nonparametric density estimate, and appropriately selecting the degree of smoothing is crucial, as it determines the shape of the density—and thus the possible modal structure—to identify the final partition. This study examines the challenges of density estimation for modal clustering from an asymptotic perspective."

However, helicity selection rules for diboson scattering amplitudes prevent the straightforward interference of dimension-six operators, leading to a cancellation of the leading order correction to the overall diboson production rate. In such cases, precise measurement of azimuthal decay angles can ""restore"" the efficacy of these interferences, enabling detection of the so-called ""non-interfering"" operators. Our detailed exploration of these phenomena shows that the uncertainties in the effective field theory (EFT), associated with higher-dimensional operators, are significantly suppressed through the formulation of an asymmetry variable. This variable is uniquely influenced only by non-interfering operators, thus diminishing the impact of interfering, higher-dimensional operators to a level comparable with statistical errors in the corresponding observable."

As others have done, we categorize the contributions of data science into three main tasks: description, prediction, and counterfactual prediction (encompassing causal inference). Clearly defining these tasks is essential for discussing the requisite data, assumptions, and analytics needed for each.

Conventionally, these particles are thought to ensure that extremal black holes are either unstable or only marginally stable. However, the consequences of this not being the case are not entirely clear. This note demonstrates that in a general Einstein quantum theory of gravity within Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space, the precise stability of extremal black branes conflicts with established quantum information theorems concerning entanglement entropy. To resolve this contradiction, the note introduces a nonperturbative version of the WGC, which aligns with the traditional interpretation in the context of weak coupling. This argument is broad, requiring neither supersymmetry nor a specific ultraviolet (UV) completion. It relies solely on the principles of Einstein gravity, effective field theory, and holography."

Ultracold 2D Fermi gases have become exemplary model systems due to their cleanliness and controllability, offering insights into the effects of strong correlations and reduced dimensionality. However, direct confirmation of superfluidity within these systems had been elusive. In our study, we provide evidence of superfluidity in an ultracold 2D Fermi gas. This is achieved by introducing a periodic potential through the system and noting an absence of dissipation below a certain critical velocity, \( v_{\rm c} \). We have quantified \( v_{\rm c} \) across varying interaction strengths and observed a peak within the transitional zone between bosonic and fermionic superfluidity.

We explore how a chiral chemical potential—representing the electron population imbalance between Weyl nodes of opposite chirality—affects the junction's transport properties. Notably, we discover a net spin polarization of Cooper pairs generated through Andreev reflection within the two Weyl semimetal regions. This spin polarization is opposite in each of the Weyl semimetal regions and is notably sensitive to the chirality imbalance and excitation energy."

However, a potential concern is the long-term stability of the enhanced conductivity from the implantation, particularly if the implanted metal is prone to oxidation. In this study, we explore the long-term conductivity behavior of titanium-implanted alumina.

Moreover, there are singular configurations that can be interpreted as baryons with flavor number n_f=1, exhibiting charge under this new symmetry. Within this framework, vector mesons act as Chern–Simons vector fields existing on a quantum Hall droplet, which constitutes the n_f=1 baryon. We suggest that this current accurately represents the baryon current at low energies. Our model offers a cohesive perspective that reconciles both baryon types, enabling a natural transformation between them.

We conduct a theoretical analysis to explore how the interplay of these effects influences the transport properties of superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator/superconductor junctions. The skew tunneling of Cooper pairs, dependent on transverse momentum, across the spin-active ferromagnetic insulator interface, leads to significant transverse Hall supercurrents. We refer to these as anomalous Josephson Hall effect currents. We extend the Furusaki-Tsukada formula—originally established to measure conventional Josephson current flows via tunneling—to assess the transverse current components. Our findings reveal that the amplitudes of these currents can be significantly tuned through the strength of spin-orbit coupling or by altering the superconducting phase difference across the junction. Additionally, as a distinct spectroscopic signature of Josephson junctions, well-defined subgap bound states emerge around the interface."
224,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,paper_abstract,"In line with the findings from the Monte Carlo simulations as noted in Jiménez's study (J. of Turbul., 2020), dipoles play a crucial role in the dynamics of decaying two-dimensional turbulence, comparable to that of individual vortex cores. The kinetic energy in this turbulent flow primarily resides in elongated streams composed of interconnected dipoles. The vortices divide into two distinct groups: one consisting of small, fast-moving cores, and another of larger, slower ones, which appear to be 'frozen' into a gradually developing 'crystal.' The motion of these two groups is markedly different, with only the smaller, fast-moving group displaying self-similarity. The majority of the kinetic energy is attributed to the slower, larger vortices, which form the dipoles and streams. The text also explores the processes contributing to the expansion of this slow-moving component."
225,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,paper_abstract,"Continuous-time quantum walks have become an invaluable tool for developing various quantum algorithms. The efficiency of these algorithms is often measured by the quantum hitting time, which indicates how long it takes for a quantum walk to identify a specific vertex with high probability. In this article, we present enhanced upper limits for quantum hitting time applicable to numerous algorithms utilizing continuous-time quantum walks. Notably, we apply our methodology to the glued-trees problem, resulting in a substantial reduction of the hitting time upper bound from $o(n^5)$ to $o(n^2\log n)$. Additionally, our approach significantly improves the precision dependence of the continuous-time quantum walk based algorithm developed by Chakraborty et al. for locating a marked node across any ergodic, reversible Markov chain."
226,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,paper_abstract,"Extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) can be categorized into dry EMRIs and wet EMRIs based on how they form. Dry EMRIs, or ""loss-cone"" EMRIs, have traditionally been seen as the primary sources for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). These are predominantly generated through multi-body scattering within nuclear star clusters and gravitational capture. In this letter, we introduce an alternative EMRI formation mechanism: wet EMRI formation, facilitated by the accretion flows surrounding massive black holes (MBHs) at galactic centers. In this scenario, the accretion disk captures stellar-mass black holes that initially move on inclined orbits and drives them to migrate toward the MBH. This significantly increases the EMRI formation rate in such galaxies by several orders of magnitude."

This means they have no history of interacting with items, no established user profile, and no connections with other users on the platform. Despite this, it is essential that our recommender systems engage new users from the outset, enticing them to remain on the site and become active participants. This challenge is known as the new user cold-start problem, and it is critical to both the growth and even the viability of a company. Current solutions for addressing user cold-start scenarios typically involve asking for additional input from users, such as through an interview process, or leveraging supplementary data like user demographics, location, or social networks [10]. Nevertheless, users might be reluctant to participate in interviews, and often, this supplementary information is not readily available for new users."
228,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,paper_abstract,"Deep learning has effectively addressed numerous challenges that heuristic algorithms couldn't tackle. It has also found success in the realm of wireless communications, despite the fact that current radio systems are thoroughly understood and many tasks have existing optimal algorithms. Although learning specific components of a receiver has yielded some benefits, a more advantageous strategy is to learn the entire receiver collectively. This approach, however, often leads to a complex nonlinear problem, making the optimal solution impractical for implementation. To address this, we introduce a deep fully convolutional neural network named DeepRx, designed to handle the entire receiver process from processing the frequency domain signal stream to generating uncoded bits, all while adhering to 5G standards. We enhance precise channel estimation by meticulously crafting the input of the convolutional neural network, integrating both the data and pilot symbols in a specific manner."
229,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,paper_abstract,"Mutation-based fuzzing begins with a starting set of seed inputs that don't cause crashes, known as a corpus, and generates new inputs through mutation. Often, a corpus may include thousands of similar inputs, which can result in redundant fuzzing efforts when all seeds are mutated exhaustively. To optimize this, fuzzing tools include distillation utilities, like afl-cmin, which help select the smallest subset of seeds capable of triggering the same range of instrumentation data points as the full set. It is a common belief that reducing the number and overall size of seeds enhances fuzzing efficiency, a theory which we examine systematically. We present findings from over 34 CPU-years of fuzzing across five different distillation methods to assess their effectiveness in identifying bugs in real-world software."
230,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,paper_abstract,"In this paper, we explore the concept of multi-agent discrete-event systems operating under partial observation. The agents can be categorized into groups, with each group sharing similar (isomorphic) state transition structures—allowing them to be relabeled using a common template. This template is used to develop a scalable supervisor whose state size and computational cost remain constant, irrespective of the number of agents involved, even under partial observation. Remarkably, this scalable supervisor doesn't require reconfiguration as agents are added or removed from the system. We extend our previous findings to accommodate partial observation by presenting sufficient conditions that ensure safety and maximize the permissiveness of the scalable, least restrictive supervisor at the template level. An example is included to demonstrate the proposed scalable supervisory synthesis."
231,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,paper_abstract,"Electric Network Frequency (ENF) fluctuations serve as a highly effective tool in multimedia forensics. We introduce an advanced method for ENF estimation that incorporates temporal windowing through the filter-bank Capon spectral estimator. This technique leverages the Gohberg-Semencul factorization to handle the Toeplitz structure inherent in the model's covariance matrix. Notably, for the first time in ENF analysis, a non-rectangular temporal window is utilized prior to spectral estimation, enhancing the method's versatility. Additionally, Krylov matrices are utilized to expedite matrix inversions. This innovative approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods in terms of ENF estimation, particularly when implementing a brief one-second time window for power recordings. In the context of speech recordings, our method achieves remarkable accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency."

Additionally, it offers regularized regression estimators that utilize these reduced dimension spaces, encompassing methods from classic principal component regression to sparse partial robust M regression. The package also includes a suite of both classical and robust preprocessing tools, such as generalized spatial signs, along with dedicated plotting features and cross-validation utilities. Notably, direpack is designed to seamlessly integrate with the scikit-learn API, allowing its estimators to be effortlessly incorporated into statistical and machine learning pipelines within that framework."
233,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,paper_abstract,"Nonlinear fluorescence emission has become a valuable tool for achieving high spatial resolution in optical imaging. In this study, we explored the fluorescence anomalous saturating effect associated with nitrogen vacancy defects in diamond. When exposed to high-power laser excitation, we observed a reduction in fluorescence that increased the nonlinearity of the emission. This change altered the spatial frequency distribution of the resulting fluorescence image. To capture detailed high spatial frequency information, we employed a differential excitation protocol, which involved modulating the power of the excitation laser. This approach enhanced the spatial resolution of imaging by approximately 1.6 times compared to conventional confocal microscopy. Owing to the straightforward nature of both the experimental setup and data processing, we anticipate that this technique will be highly beneficial for increasing the spatial resolution in applications such as sensing and biological labeling using defects in solids."
234,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,paper_abstract,"When random effects are correlated with sample design variables, the typical practice of using individual survey weights—designed to be inversely proportional to unit survey inclusion probabilities—to form a pseudo-likelihood no longer leads to asymptotically unbiased inference. We propose a weight-exponentiated formulation for the random effects distribution that enables unbiased inference for generating the hyperparameters of the random effects. In comparison to frequentist methods that depend on numerical integration, our Bayesian approach is unique in achieving both unbiased estimation relative to the sampling design distribution and consistency with the population-generating distribution. Through simulations and a real-world example involving a survey of business establishments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across various modeling frameworks and sampling designs. This work culminates recent advancements combining traditional survey estimation techniques with the Bayesian modeling paradigm, effectively bridging these two rich yet distinct subfields."

The reduced symmetries in these novel materials lead to diverse and inhomogeneous electronic, optical, valley, and spin properties, as well as entirely new phenomena including ferroelasticity, ferroelectricity, magnetism, spin-wave activities, significant nonlinear optical characteristics, photogalvanic effects, and superconductivity. Additionally, these low-symmetry materials can demonstrate unique electronic topological properties, nonlinear elastic characteristics, and structural phase transformations. The special topic ""Beyond Graphene: Low-Symmetry and Anisotropic 2D Materials"" has been curated to showcase pioneering experimental and theoretical research in these cutting-edge materials."
236,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,paper_abstract,"The study of orientational dynamics in the isotropic phase of a comb-shaped nematic polymer, featuring both mesogenic and functional side groups, utilized the Kerr effect and dielectric spectroscopy for analysis. This investigation revealed, for the first time, a distinct behavior in mesogenic polymers compared to low-molecular-weight mesogens: the relaxation of electric birefringence in a melt above the nematic-isotropic phase transition temperature can be described by a combination of multiple exponential processes, with two processes playing a crucial role. These primary processes take turns dominating across a temperature range of approximately fifty degrees. Dielectric spectroscopy also identified two types of orientational relaxation processes: one arising from the rotation of side mesogenic groups and the other from the movement of main chain segments."
237,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,paper_abstract,"Deep hashing techniques have demonstrated exceptional accuracy and efficiency in large-scale image retrieval. A central challenge in these methods is optimizing discrete hash bits. Typically, this involves using an activation function, such as the sigmoid or tanh, and minimizing a quantization loss to approximate discrete values. Unfortunately, this approach can cause hash bits to become stuck in the wrong saturated zones of these activation functions, creating what we refer to as the ""dead bits problem"" (DBP). Furthermore, the current quantization loss exacerbates the DBP. In this paper, we introduce a straightforward yet effective gradient amplifier, applied before the activation functions, to mitigate the DBP."
238,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,paper_abstract,"We investigate the properties of an SU(2) triplet scalar with zero hypercharge, which is encouraged by the concept of a two-step electroweak symmetry-breaking process. Our study explores two scenarios: first, where these triplets are stable and contribute to dark matter, and second, where they decay through interactions with the standard model Higgs boson. The stability scenario is scrutinized by searches for disappearing charged tracks at the LHC and by direct detection dark matter experiments. In contrast, the decay scenario faces constraints from current multilepton collider searches. Our findings indicate that a two-step electroweak phase transition involving a stable triplet with a negative quadratic term is prohibited by direct detection investigations. Additionally, an unstable triplet with a mass under 230 GeV is ruled out at a 95% confidence level."
239,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,paper_abstract,"This paper demonstrates that the eccentric debris rings observed around the stars Fomalhaut and HD 202628 are narrower than anticipated under the traditional model of eccentric planet perturbation, commonly known as ""pericenter glow."" This model suggests that a belt of planetesimals, initially circular and situated at a semi-major axis $a$, has its eccentricity elevated to $e_f$ through secular perturbations from an eccentric planet once the gas disc disperses, thereby forming a belt with a width of $2ae_f$. However, a slight modification to this model allows for narrower belts if the planetesimals originally possess some eccentricity, a condition that could arise from earlier planetary disturbances during the gas-rich protoplanetary disc phase. Alternatively, this initial eccentricity might be a consequence of instabilities that amplify the disc's eccentricity, independent of planetary influences."
240,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,paper_abstract,"Traditional understanding suggests that an electron primarily exhibits a single form of kinetic energy. However, could it possess additional variations related to its spin, charge, or interactions with other electrons? In one-dimensional (1D) systems, the Tomonaga-Luttinger-Liquid (TLL) model accurately describes the behavior of interacting electrons at low energies, though experimental observations beyond this linear range have been limited. In this study, we present our findings on many-body modes in 1D gated wires through tunneling spectroscopy techniques. We detected two distinct Fermi seas at elevated energies, corresponding to spin and charge excitations, along with the development of three additional 1D 'replica' modes that become more pronounced with shorter wire lengths. The effective interaction strength within the wires was modified by adjusting the degree of 1D inter-subband screening, exceeding a 45% change."

It appears that the globular cluster system within our galaxy has followed an equally complex formation path. To better understand this formation, we investigate the connection between these globular clusters and the known merger events that the Milky Way has undergone. By integrating Gaia's kinematic data for nearly all galactic clusters with the most comprehensive and systematically corrected sample of cluster ages, we identify clusters that likely share a common origin through an analysis of their dynamical properties, specifically within the context of integrals of motion. Our findings suggest that approximately 40% of these clusters likely originated within the galaxy itself."

These systems were designed to tackle image classification tasks and nonlinear dynamic system predictions, respectively. Our micromagnetic simulations highlight the nonlinear responses of MSM and STNOs when stimulated by current pulses, demonstrating that an RC system based on a single MSM excels in image classification tasks, such as recognizing handwritten digits.

In this study, we explore an unexpected outcome of popularity-based rankings: the fewer the number of items that signify a particular indicator, the greater the proportion of total traffic they tend to garner. This phenomenon, known as the few-get-richer effect, becomes evident in scenarios where there are limited distinct categories of items (for instance, news outlets with left-leaning and right-leaning biases) and items are ranked by their popularity. Through analytical methods, we demonstrate that this effect is pronounced when users predominantly click on items that top the rankings and exhibit diverse preferences for the categories. We further examine the effect's intensity under varying assumptions about the environment and human behavior through simulations.

To address this issue, we introduce a novel sparsity dimension: pattern-based sparsity, which includes both pattern and connectivity sparsity, ensuring high accuracy and hardware compatibility. By using meticulously crafted patterns, our pruning method consistently enhances accuracy and improves feature extraction across various DNN architectures and datasets. Additionally, our pattern-aware pruning framework enables simultaneous library extraction, pattern selection, pattern and connectivity pruning, and weight training. This pattern-based sparsity approach is seamlessly integrated into compiler optimization, enabling highly efficient DNN execution on mobile platforms."

To mitigate this bias, it is beneficial to create a more closely matched control group by aligning a subset from the overall control group with the treated group. We explore this issue through simulation studies. Specifically, we investigate the impact of mountaintop removal mining (MRM) on mortality rates using a difference-in-differences approach, capitalizing on the surge in MRM following the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments. By constructing a more precisely matched control group for our analysis of MRM's effect on mortality, we established a 95% confidence interval that encompasses a range of outcomes, including significant adverse effects, no effect, and minor beneficial effects."

This approach is generally straightforward and widely applicable. Our focus here is on applying this method to time-to-event data, particularly addressing the challenge posed when a time-varying covariate is unknown or cannot be reasonably approximated after the event time."

I'm an avid reader, delving into the narratives from Ian McEwan to Stephanie Meyer, including having completed the entire Twilight series. My passion extends to my home theater, where I eagerly consume DVDs, video on demand, and an assortment of television shows. For me, series like “Law & Order: SVU,” the comedic genius of Tina Fey in “30 Rock,” and the compelling cases on “Judge Judy” are paramount—enthralling me with their authenticity and definitive judgments."
271,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"Dear Global Citizens,

We are confronted with a crisis of unparalleled magnitude. Please prepare to receive a statement from António Guterres, the Secretary-General of the United Nations. 

The climate emergency is the defining challenge of our era. We find ourselves in a race against time, and unfortunately, we are falling behind. There is an increasing sense of urgency and impatience, particularly among the youth, due to the lack of decisive global action. It is crucial that we see greater ambition from all sectors: governments, cities, businesses, investors, and individuals alike. 

I am encouraged by the launch of TED Countdown. Your influence and innovative ideas can play a pivotal role in accelerating progress towards achieving a carbon-neutral world by 2050. This is our only viable path to mitigating the worst impacts of global warming. We possess the tools, scientific knowledge, and resources necessary to succeed. Now, let us engage in this race with renewed political resolve and vigor."

But why is that the case? As I speak to you now, over 800 million women worldwide are experiencing their periods. This process is essential to human existence, yet it continues to be an ""embarrassing"" topic. From my experiences and those of the women around me, I can tell you it's draining. It's exhausting to discreetly pull a pad in a brown paper bag from your bag, tuck it into your pocket during class, and hurry to the restroom hoping not to draw attention. It's tiring to endure lessons and meetings, feigning normalcy while inwardly battling intense period cramps."
273,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"The world's largest and most devastating environmental and industrial project is located in the heart of Canada's boreal forest, the largest and most pristine forest on Earth. This vast, untouched wilderness stretches across northern Canada and is home to the George River caribou herd in Labrador, which is the largest remaining wild caribou herd in the world with approximately 400,000 animals. Sadly, during my visit, I was unable to spot any caribou, though the antlers serve as evidence of their presence. Throughout the boreal forest, we are blessed with an incredible abundance of wetlands. Globally, wetlands are among the most endangered ecosystems. These vital ecosystems play a crucial role in purifying air and water, sequestering significant amounts of greenhouse gases, and providing habitat to a vast diversity of species."
274,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"Before the era of humans, there existed a realm belonging to the gods, characterized by vast fields, plains, and gardens. In this divine landscape roamed four brothers. They were each other’s sole kin, their parentage a mystery. Among them was Deminan, distinguished by skin marred with painful scabs, a burden he bore alone that left him pondering its origin. One day, while the supreme spirit Yaya tended to his gardens, Deminan and his brothers stealthily entered Yaya's home. There, after satisfying their curiosity with exploration and indulgence, they noticed a colossal gourd suspended in a corner. In their attempt to examine it, the gourd slipped from their grasp and fell."
275,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"Seven years ago, I graduated from Berkeley with dual degrees in Molecular and Cell Biology and Linguistics. During a career fair on campus, I secured an interview with a start-up called Theranos. At the time, there wasn't much information available about the company, but the little that was known was quite impressive. Theranos was developing a medical device that allowed for a full blood panel using just a finger-stick of blood. This innovation was intriguing not only because it eliminated the need for large needles, making the process less painful, but also because it had the potential to revolutionize predictive diagnostics."
276,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"My journey to becoming a polar specialist and photographer began at the age of four when my family relocated from southern Canada to northern Baffin Island, near Greenland. We settled in a small Inuit community of about 200 people, and we were one of only three non-Inuit families there. In this remote area, we had no television, computers, or even a radio. We didn't have a telephone either. I spent all my time outdoors with the Inuit, playing and learning from them. The snow and ice became my playground, and the Inuit were my mentors. This experience kindled my deep fascination with the polar regions."
277,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"We are often viewed as the last resort for addressing failed social policies. We cannot choose who comes to us or dictate how long they remain. We are left to manage individuals for whom all other social safety nets have failed—those who have slipped through the cracks. Other systems can't handle them, so we must. Our task is to contain and control them. Over the years, as part of the prison system, our nation, and society, we have become adept at this. However, this is not an achievement to take pride in. Currently, we incarcerate more people per capita than any other nation in the world. Moreover, there are more Black men in prison today than there were enslaved in 1850."
278,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"Let me take you on the remarkable journey of the Rosetta spacecraft, a mission that has fueled my passion for the past two years. Its purpose was to accompany and land a probe on a comet. To truly appreciate this mission, it's essential to explore the origins of our solar system. Imagine a time four and a half billion years ago, when a vast cloud of gas and dust existed. At the heart of this cloud, our sun was born and began to shine. From this same cloud emerged what we now recognize as planets, comets, and asteroids. The prevailing theory suggests that once Earth had cooled after its formation, it was struck by numerous comets. These cosmic encounters brought vast amounts of water to our planet, and perhaps even complex organic molecules that may have initiated the genesis of life itself."
279,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"Chris Anderson: Hello, TED community, and welcome back to another live conversation. Today’s discussion is as significant as they come. When we launched the ""Build Back Better"" series, our aim was to tackle issues stemming from the pandemic and explore how we could rebuild in its aftermath. However, the tragic death of George Floyd this past week and the subsequent daily protests have brought a new urgency to our dialogue that we cannot ignore. Can we emerge stronger and better from this? Before we attempt to answer that question, we must first strive to comprehend the vast significance of this moment.

Whitney Pennington Rodgers: Absolutely, Chris."
280,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"In 1903, the President of the United States embarked on a three-day camping expedition in California's Yosemite Valley. President Theodore Roosevelt spent his nights amidst the towering sequoia trees, braved a snowstorm, and engaged in extended discussions around the campfire with his host and guide, the conservationist John Muir. While Roosevelt was an avid lover of the outdoors, Muir had a purpose beyond recreation for inviting him: Yosemite was under threat. Although it had been designated protected land since 1864, by 1903, the valley faced significant risks of overdevelopment. This was central to a longstanding struggle to reserve land for preservation while making it accessible for public use—objectives that were easier to articulate than achieve. The conflict over Yosemite's future began during the 1849 Gold Rush when miners flocked westward, searching for gold in the Sierra Nevada foothills."

(applause) My lifelong dream has been to become a pilot, to fly an airplane, and to experience the freedom of soaring through the sky. Unfortunately, that dream hasn't come true. Living in Gaza means there is no airport, and all borders are sealed off in every direction. We exist in what is one of the largest open-air prisons worldwide. My only option is to gaze up at the sky. There are days when we are fortunate if we have electricity for only four or five hours. When the weather turns chilly, we gather to build a fire either in front of or atop our homes."
282,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"I apologize, but I cannot reveal my face, as doing so would put me at risk from those who seek to harm me. My journey began 14 years ago when I was a newly graduated young reporter. One day, I stumbled upon what seemed like a straightforward story: police officers accepting bribes from street vendors. Although this issue was widely known, no efforts had effectively addressed it. As an ambitious young journalist, I aimed to present the story in a unique and impactful manner. To achieve this, I decided to go undercover as a vendor, allowing me to gather irrefutable evidence of the wrongdoing. The resulting impact was remarkable and powerful. This approach is often referred to as immersion journalism or undercover journalism."
283,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"Every day, health headlines capture our attention with claims like, ""A single vitamin can lower your risk of heart disease,"" or ""Eating chocolate reduces stress among students."" We also hear about breakthroughs like, ""New drug extends lives of patients with rare diseases."" However, these headlines often contradict each other or oversimplify the complex findings of the underlying research. This discrepancy arises because catchy headlines tend to overlook the nuanced and incremental nature of scientific studies. How can you ensure that you’re not misled by sensationalistic headlines? The key is to examine the original research that the headline is based on. We've crafted hypothetical research scenarios to illustrate this point for each of these headlines. Stay tuned for an explanation of the first example, and take a moment to reflect when you see the headline. These scenarios are simplified for clarity."
284,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"When I was 14, my family was in the process of adopting my younger brothers from Ethiopia. One day, my mom posed an unexpected question: ""What date should we choose for their birthdays?"" I replied in disbelief, ""The day they were born, of course!"" To which my mom responded, ""Kristen, neither of your little brothers has a birth certificate, so how do you suggest we find out their actual birthdays?"" This revelation was eye-opening for me. Fast forward 20 years, and I am still deeply engaged with this issue. However, instead of solely focusing on my brothers' lack of birth certificates, I am now working on finding solutions to this problem on a global scale. But you might wonder, what is the connection between birth certificates and international development?"

If presented with this opportunity, would you take it? This is the intriguing question posed by philosopher Robert Nozick in his thought experiment known as the Experience Machine. This scenario invites us to envision a world where scientists have created a machine that replicates real life while ensuring perpetual pleasure without any suffering. The trade-off? You must abandon reality permanently, although you would scarcely notice the difference. Your experiences would feel indistinguishable from real life. The natural highs and lows of life would be replaced with a never-ending series of highs. Tempting, isn't it?"

I was called in as a consultant to assess a woman in her 70s, a retired English professor suffering from pancreatic cancer. My role was to address her issues with pain, nausea, and vomiting. During our consultation, she inquired whether I believed medical marijuana could alleviate her symptoms. Reflecting on my medical school education regarding medical marijuana, I realized, to my chagrin, that I had learned absolutely nothing about it."

My team and I are dedicated to saving lives and protecting property from various emergencies, including car accidents, house fires, and critical medical situations. As a woman leading a department in a predominantly male field, I decided to enhance my medical expertise by earning a nursing degree ten years ago. This decision was motivated by the realization that the emerging threat to my city, and others across the nation, was no longer a single, manageable disaster. Unlike before, when a firefighter could respond, extinguish the blaze, and leave with a sense of accomplishment, the challenges we face now require a more comprehensive approach to truly make a difference."
288,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"Where does all the carbon we emit go? Carbon participates in a natural cycle that permeates all living entities: it resides in the soil, the oceans, the atmosphere, and deep underground rocks. When plants and other living organisms die, a significant portion of their stored carbon returns to the atmosphere until new plant life emerges to reabsorb it. Over millions of years, some of the carbon from ancient trees and marine life transforms into rock or fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas. Natural occurrences, such as volcanic eruptions, release some of the carbon contained in these rocks. Human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, also release this ancient carbon. Currently, human activities release approximately 60 times more carbon annually than all the planet's volcanoes combined."
289,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"Even the most unappealing creatures in nature hold valuable secrets. Take cockroaches, for instance—despite their off-putting reputation, they possess fascinating capabilities that highlight a profound contrast between natural and human-made technologies: robustness. Robust systems excel in maintaining stability across complex and unfamiliar environments. Astonishingly, cockroaches demonstrate the ability to self-stabilize while traversing uneven terrain. When we equipped them with a jet pack or introduced a disturbance akin to an earthquake, we found that their exquisitely designed legs enable them to maintain balance without engaging any cognitive processes. They effortlessly navigate challenging landscapes, such as grass, without becoming destabilized. Additionally, we observed a novel behavior facilitated by their unique shape, which allows them to naturally roll to one side to maneuver through artificial grass obstacles. Robust systems are capable of performing a variety of tasks using the same structural framework, and this new behavior exemplifies that principle."

This story is comparable, in its unique way, to the achievements of tech giants like Microsoft or Google. The industry in question has managed to thrive even amid the current recession. I am referring to organized crime. While organized crime has been part of society for a long time, recent decades have seen an unprecedented surge, now representing roughly 15 percent of the global GDP. I like to call this the global shadow economy, or ""McMafia"" for short. But what has fueled this extraordinary growth in cross-border crime?"
291,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"When asked about which aspect of psychology is challenging, and prompted with ""What about thinking and emotions?"" most people typically respond that emotions are incredibly difficult to comprehend—complex beyond their understanding. In contrast, they tend to view thinking as more straightforward, equating it to some form of logical reasoning. However, this perception overlooks the true complexity of the situation. For example, consider this scenario: How do we address health issues? Recently, I read an intriguing claim stating that handshaking is possibly the greatest single contributor to disease spread in Western countries."

This is not an easy question, especially in today's diverse family structures involving adoption, stepfamilies, and surrogate motherhood. Many parents encounter challenging questions and face difficult decisions, such as whether to inform their child about a sperm donation and, if so, when is the right time and which words to choose. While sperm donors are often labeled as ""biological fathers,"" should we really use the term ""father"" in this context? As a philosopher and social scientist, I have explored these questions concerning the essence of parenthood. However, today I want to share insights gained from conversations with parents and children. I'll demonstrate that, despite the unique appearances of their families, they understand what truly matters in family life."

I see all of that and a man who spent a quarter of his life in state prison—six years, to be precise—beginning as a teenager on Rikers Island for an act that nearly cost someone their life. However, what brought me from that past to my present wasn't the punishment I faced as a teenager in an adult prison or the severity of our legal system. Rather, it was the educational environment of a classroom that opened my eyes to possibilities I never imagined for myself or the justice system at large. Just a few weeks before my release on parole, a counselor encouraged me to enroll in a new college course being offered within the prison."

(laughter) If some of your perceptions tend toward the negative, I can hardly blame you. These misconceptions largely stem from the media's portrayal of individuals who look like me. In fact, a study revealed that 80 percent of the news coverage related to Islam and Muslims is negative. Additionally, research indicates that most Americans claim not to personally know a Muslim. Perhaps this means they don’t engage much with their Uber drivers. (laughter) For those who have yet to meet a Muslim, I’m delighted to make your acquaintance."

As a recent graduate, I wasn't aware that those few moments on stage would shape the questions I would face over the next decade. Like many people in their twenties, I was eager to tackle global issues, particularly those related to water, with my technological solutions. I had much to learn. It was tempting to believe that our major water quality challenges persisted mainly because they were difficult to detect. I assumed all we needed were simpler, quicker, and more affordable sensors.
