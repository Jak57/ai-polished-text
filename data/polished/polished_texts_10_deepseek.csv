1,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"Another week just flew by me. I drove by the new house yesterday and the front window was covered in boxes. We may get the keys at closing, and I am getting so excited. If all goes well this week, we will be set for closing a week from Wednesday. I was up until after 3:00 AM last night watching movies with Bethany. There has been a lot of movie-watching going on around here lately. Here's my rundown; last night we watched *Thirteen*, a film every mother of a teen should see. It was better than I expected. Then we watched *Gigli*—yeah, it was just as bad as the media claimed, but we had to see for ourselves."
2,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"Summer TV used to be a dead zone full of repeats or something. But now there are two great new shows on and I have been watching both religiously for the last week. *Blow Out*—the gayest concept ever that seemingly has zero gay people in sight. Hairstylist Jonathan Antin wants to build a second location to his incredibly popular West Hollywood salon, but this time in Beverly Hills. Normally no one would care, certainly not me, but as I was flipping through the channels, I caught a glimpse of Jonathan—equally narcissistic and dull—looking at an empty space on Rodeo Dr., declaring (in a public voice), 'I am going to build here the greatest salon in the history of the world ever!' And I was hooked. Not since Rocco have I found such a moron compelling to watch."
3,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"What a week ... My right shoulder has tendonitis. It's right under my shoulder blade. So, when I move my arm too much, mainly with a mouse on a computer ... it kills me. I can't move it much now because I was on a spree updating my website and working on other online things. I can barely muster the strength to draw anything. Lack of sleep adds to my pain. I'm not too happy right now, but I'll get better. My mom's surgery went okay. Her eyesight has improved some. She can see fuzzy shapes and make out colors. Other than that, she's still blind as all sin. Hopefully she'll fully regain her vision soon."
4,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"Kindness of strangers... Attempted laundry today with the kids in tow and realized how very quickly the simplest things can become a freaking ordeal. I also learned how remarkably sweet total strangers can be for no reason other than because they feel like being kind. Trust me. It wasn't like they were trying to get into my pants or anything. I had kid drool all over me and was wearing my 'wash-day' outfit... Also, I'm not entirely sure I'll ever be bathing again, so it's not like there was even an olfactory incentive there! I am doing two things right now. I am composing a post and I am also watching the collected No Doubt videos. I am doing both of these things while sitting at my desk in my room."
5,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"So it is 11:14pm MST, and here I sit in my bedroom repairing the personal computer of the personnel director from my job. Not that I mind doing it, but I wonder sometimes at how frequently I find myself fixing someone else's computer as a favor. I'm glad to be able to love and serve people this way, but where is the line drawn when it comes to the point that you are being taken advantage of? The last couple of weeks, I've been staying up late reading and such, so I was looking forward to hitting the sack early, until I realized it would be more practical to get this computer out of my bedroom and back into its owner's hands. *laugh* No rest for the weary, right? So I found myself watching Joe Schmo 2 again tonight."
6,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"Remind me, what did I write about before this? Or, a continuation in the 'is this a date?' saga. So, after the awkward lunch, my confidence shook, I forgot to tell you guys an important piece of the story. Before Pat shows up to lunch, Dustin starts talking about what a great guy Pat is and how he's trying to find a girlfriend for him. I'm listening and nodding and realizing that we're talking more about finding Dustin's best friend a girl, than discussing whatever it is you discuss with a stranger over pink lemonade. I excused myself to the bathroom, looked in the mirror, and then silently asked myself: am I being pawned off to the other guy? Is this what happens now?"
7,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"I would like everyone to think before they act. Actually... I'd like each and every single person in the world to consider before they get out of bed in the morning, and make a commitment to keep thinking all day. If they're not prepared to, I'd very much prefer they hop right back in bed and drift off to an eternal slumber. I'm sick to death of stupid people. No, I'm not the smartest person in the world... But I'm not talking about things that require a lot of brainpower, so I think it's fair to criticize the inanely stupid. Let's see if I can limit this particular rant to a few specific types, and we'll save some for another day. Sound good? Great."
8,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"Two issues with the scenario outlined in my previous post: 1. True, Bush is stimulating the economy, but in the wrong way. Urllink Robert Rubin told NPR's Marketplace today that Bush could have achieved the same stimulus effect without the long-term debt hangover by implementing different tax cuts, temporary tax cuts that would benefit low and middle-income individuals. Ah, Robert Rubin. The sound of his name is music to our ears. Quick: name one Bush administration cabinet official on the domestic side with Rubin's gravitas. Still thinking? It’ll come to you... 2. We can't give the Republicans control only in wartime because they've ingeniously crafted an endless, global 'war on terrorism.'"

Like you're sitting in math class bored out of your skull, and you wonder what exactly goes on in your brain that helps you understand math? Then you realize that you exist and you are in math class and you question why. Suddenly, it dawns on you how amazing existing is. And just like that, it hits you—the fact that you are going off on this random train of thought is incredibly pathetic. Ever had that happen? I hate that. You know what else I hate? Block schedules. Who would ever come up with that idea? Anyone can see that sitting through a two-and-a-half-hour class in any subject is cruel and unusual punishment."

Tonight Andy beat me by a few small dollars and won the frustrating game, or maybe I let him win on account of him leaving in a few short hours and me wanting him to feel good on his last night here. Well however the story goes it can't compare to this Texas-sized headache I have at the moment. I've taken some Aleve and I must say that it is doing the trick; all I need now is some well-deserved R&R. Your telephone's the one that helped me wrap the cord around your neck... At the Drive-In."
12,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"Well... Today's been a long day. We had to drive home from Indiana. I guess I'm going to have to be choosy about what I write because I could really take up a lot of time and space, and I just don't have enough energy. First off, I have to say that camp was awesome and even better than I could have expected. God's been doing so much in my life lately, and it's just amazing. I've sort of turned over a new leaf, I guess, but anyway, back to the beginning. We arrived at the Twiggs' house on Friday evening and stayed until we left for camp on Monday. Most of what we did was go to the fair, church, a parade, Walmart, and watched movies."

I hate that, but I'd rather get it over with than try to schedule it during the first month of my surgery rotation. I'm definitely nervous, scared, jittery, and any other words you can think of for 'hell no, I don't wanna go' to school. This is going to be a whole new challenge for me. As a perfectionist, I love excelling at everything I do. But starting new things is tough. I hate being a pawn (like I told Cassie: 'I'm going to be the only pawn on the chessboard who insists on moving like a knight'), and I hate not knowing what's going on."
14,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"Arun Shourie discusses how the current governor of Uttar Pradesh had warned, as far back as 1996, about the impending threat of the rise of a so-called 'third Islamic state' in the subcontinent. T V Rajeswar, the former head of the Intelligence Bureau and the current governor of Uttar Pradesh, had predicted this dire threat in a series of articles published in *The Hindustan Times* back in 1996. Shourie raises a valid point when he asks, does the fact that you now know he, and not I, to say nothing of Mr. Advani, wrote all that make the warnings more credible? Or do you conclude that because he wrote in this vein, T V Rajeswar is a closet communalist and should not remain as governor of Uttar Pradesh?"

Been a long hard day in the trenches here today, folks, almost no time to write anything for you readers. However, it's great to see Tigger (now Akcron) taking up the reins herself and making an appearance while discussing things :) Not much to say about recent events—yesterday was Shakespeare on the Green, a lovely play, but I had to leave before the final curtain, which was disappointing. Hopefully someday I'll see an entire Shakespeare performance. But I digress. Akcron is right about the shower issues—it's terrible. As for laughing at her in the shower, you have to admit, the expression people make when enduring self-torture can be pretty amusing."
16,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"All of a sudden, for the past two days, I have been overwhelmed with terrible bouts of exhaustion. Bone-dead exhaustion. Last evening, I went home and just slept, only waking when my mother called me around eight thirty. And when I woke up, it was completely dark, and I hadn't switched the lights on, so I could not figure out what time or date it was. For a few seconds, it was just my mother's voice in the darkness and me grappling with reality. Wonder why I'm feeling so drained... Nice weather this morning. It was drizzling when I arrived. Although in Calcutta I hear it's been raining for the past three days."
17,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"Last night was the worst. I threw away the sweater I was knitting. I only had about 14 inches left. I lost probably $10 worth of yarn (it's $8 a skein). But it had too many stitches by the time I reached the arm holes, and the mohair was tangling itself together as I knitted, so frogging (ripping out rows) didn't work well. The yarn kept breaking. I didn't even swear, which is unusual for me. I just morosely ripped and listened to season two of *Sex and the City* (way to go, library!). Then I got sick of it and threw it away. I suppose I could say I learned a lot while attempting this sweater."
18,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"Last night in class, we discussed that week’s assigned reading, *Getting Back into Place: Toward a Renewed Study of the Place-World*, by Edward S. Casey. The first chapter explores “implacement” and the second, “displacement.” In the opening chapter, Casey argues that our contemporary world and culture revolve around time as the organizing force: we are running out of time, we have saved time, we are just in time. He suggests that using place as the center of culture fosters a more grounded community. (That is a very rough summary—a disclaimer in case my professor or any classmate happens to read this post.) So far, this book is the first reading that has grabbed me by the proverbial shoulders."

And while giggling is good, one wonders if we would have ended up on that fire escape drinking beer in the fierce wind had we not been eating them earlier. Finding ourselves in front of a bar sadly closed for business, we stopped to examine an office-supplies catalogue that had arrived in the post. Lucky we did. Who could possibly have guessed that within these pages were the deals of a lifetime? Not me, for certain. I list but a few: buy 36 permanent marker pens, get a stunt kite. Buy 30 lever arch files, get a barbecue."

Senate Republicans—okay, hands up—who watched the 39-hour judicial nominations marathon last week? I know I didn't. Well, okay—I did tune in once or twice. The entire colossal waste of time was orchestrated by Republicans who, furious that Democrats wouldn't roll over and confirm four of Bush's extreme justices, were trying to score political points by holding a multi-day cry-fest. Never mind the fact that Democrats have already approved 168 of Bush's judicial nominees—nooo, that's not good enough for the power-hungry Republicans who are for some reason convinced they have a huge mandate for this kind of nonsense."
21,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"This was a good weekend. I did a lot of god's green leaf, after a long time, I listened to a lot of Nevermore (something I should have started doing much earlier) and read a lot. I finished three books over the weekend—Bruce Sterling's *Heavy Weather*, Larry Niven's *World of Ptavvs*, and Octavia Butler's *Parable of the Sower*. *Heavy Weather* was a thrilling cyberpunk romp through a near-future USA, devastated by global warming and general anarchy. While it was clever, well-paced, and altogether very convincing, I must admit that I failed to come away with any truly profound impressions about the story or the characters. Not that both aren't well constructed and vividly etched—it's a good book, but not a great one, I suppose."
22,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"Because this is the aftermath, the first week back from practicum was a struggle, but it is only in the second week that the smoke has really started to clear. Post-practicum trauma was a hidden epidemic that is only now coming to light. I was stricken, but the eventual meeting with the course coordinator allowed me to release my burden, and by doing so, I have prevented another person from being stuck with such a pedagogically deficient practicum school. Yesterday (Monday), I bumped into another aggrieved classmate who was quite determined to go to the student who was due to go to her school in the next practicum and tell him how terrible it would be. I calmed her down and said that we should go to the administrator first."

Rick (the Canuck) beats me regularly—we have a ping pong table in the front lobby of our building, always time for a 'quick round.' Last night I participated in an 8-ball tournament over at the Hot Spot (our recreation tent—complete with popcorn machine, multiple TVs, jukebox, DVD rental, pool table, dartboard, and ever-present ping pong table). Anyway, I was doing pretty well throughout my entire game—until I scratched on the eight ball ;( I still had a great time—the most fun was the two Dutch soldiers who joined the tournament."

I was not then nor am I now a math person. I hate math. I am math phobic. You get the idea. So as I struggled to make sense of algebra, the doorbell rang. I put down my book and went to open the door. No one was there. Great. I returned to my studies, and just as I was finding a little glimmer of understanding buried in my subconscious, the doorbell rang again. Bam, just like that, my breakthrough vanished. I went to the door and once again no one was there. Just what a struggling math student needs—an uninvited practical joker."

The new room is bigger and closer to my grade-level team, which are the things I need to consider as I spend hours upon hours preparing my room for this year. Had I known I was going to move prior to the end of my school year, I would have discarded many of the books and supplies I no longer use. Unfortunately, it all came with me. So this week was spent moving, unpacking, and purging profusely. I have to thank my teammate Jill for helping with all of this. You see, she was still teaching this month, in my old room.

Forever will I be reminded of the precious few nights we spent together, hearts and limbs entwined in a soul-embrace, drenched in the salty darkness of an evening by the beach ...

Or let me rephrase that, the article I'm writing and its consequences are not exactly something I'm comfortable with.

I've grown up in a country where you don't ask questions. Really, you just don't. They shoot you for that shit. They imprison you under all these internal security acts.

It was a 30-minute or so walk. We were all catching our breaths. Whew! But we made it. The water was icy cold. You could feel your body going numb from the chill. We only stayed less than an hour before heading to the nearby waterfalls. Another 30 minutes of trekking. But the trip was worth it because the falls looked serene and the whole scene was truly breathtaking. It's like you could hear yourself becoming one with nature. Soaking in the cold water felt like communing with Mother Earth. The cold air and water were enough to lull you to sleep."

There is nothing better than to see the excitement on your child's face. After egg hunting, we all went to church.

By Gary Fineout and Alfonso Chardy, the citizenship ceremony in Jacksonville seemed to proceed as usual, with a crowd of nearly 200 people going home as new Americans. Just before the new citizens left the June 29 event, an immigration official overseeing the swearing-in urged them to stop by a voter registration table—a not uncommon sight at naturalization ceremonies. But this table was unusual: those distributing forms were Republican volunteers—and the party affiliation box had been checked off ahead of time to make all of the new voters members of the GOP. All of it was suspicious to Linda Cross, who was there to watch her husband, Dario Cruz, take his citizenship oath."

As a non-American blogger, I've been a little reluctant to engage in some of these discussions, particularly the parts about flags, but since I started it (the subject, not the flag-burning) I suppose I'd better say something. Firstly, I think that the idea of having a law against flag-burning is completely absurd. The moment you start granting a symbol—any symbol—that kind of automatic reverence and protection, you've taken a small but important step toward totalitarianism. Symbols are rather fickle—they don't inherently represent anything in themselves; it's what they are perceived as meaning or made to represent that's important."

Re: Loss of Continuity in PX Day-Ahead Auction Due to ISO Rule Changes  

The emergency tariff filing by the California ISO last Friday has negatively impacted the PX day-ahead auction market. The combination of soft and hard caps creates a complete disconnect and unacceptable risk for all participants, and it will likely fail to deliver the ISO's desired reduction in real-time energy sales and procurement. The overall effect will be that supply will still defer to the higher realized price opportunity the ISO offers. The PX is petitioning Terry Winter of the ISO to immediately permit adjustment bids on any submitted schedule at any relevant price."

This allows services to sell unit contingent energy as hourly firm since BPA is supplying reserves for up to 60 minutes. If Grays Harbor Paper notifies RT of a unit derate or outage, RT should inform BPA dispatch immediately and adjust the schedule during the next ramp. For example, should Grays unit trip at 1333, RT would notify BPA and the sink that by the top of the hour for 1400, the schedule would be reduced to zero for the 1400.

Relationship of delivery point and the use of interruptible transport on Northwest Pipeline. Is the transport upstream or downstream of the delivery point? If downstream, why isn't it being contracted by EWeb? 2. What volume is being sold each day? You use the term DCQ and also mention a 20% tolerance above or below the estimated quantity. Normally there would be no tolerance with a DCQ transaction. 3. Is this intended to be a requirements transaction? Is the price the same for volumes exceeding the estimated quantity up to an additional 20%?"

Absolutely amazing—I have nothing negative to say about this game as it's exceeded my expectations and will probably exceed yours too. Fluid movement, bug/crash-free, plenty of story/content to keep you engaged, options for each and every day such as multiple practices, events (sponsorships), and even games. This review is purely based on playing MyCareer, and so far it's 10/10. Facescan worked really well for me (used it twice, first one gave me a Down syndrome forehead though..).

97,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"Magic fans beware... Wizards is afraid to create a decent digital game. At its core, Magic: The Gathering is a social game. A game to enjoy with your friends (or frenemies) laughing, talking smack, and dropping game-winning bombs. Wizards of the Coast seems to have forgotten this. If you choose to play with friends, you can't earn gold, and gold is essential. Gold is so important that they have implemented a daily cap, understandable since gold unlocks everything in-game. But prepare for a long and tedious 1v1 grind against the computer or random opponents, whom you can't even speak to. If you choose to play for free, it will take you roughly 4 hours a day for upwards of a month, alone, to unlock the cards."
98,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"Being the 3rd installment in the trilogy, I'll get the bad stuff out of the way first. I quite hate prequels as they technically go backwards in a story rather than forwards (this is an issue for every prequel). Granted, it offers more storywise. The combat feels sloppy and isn't as sharp as Arkham City managed to make it. As of writing this recommendation (26/10/2013), there is a game-breaking bug that prevents a side mission from ever being completed (main story unaffected). Some gadgets are placed at a ridiculous hotkey that forces your hand to travel across the whole keyboard to reach it. It might sound minor, but during combat it could potentially break your combo."
99,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"They effectively improved Shadow Warrior (2013). The bossfights are awesome, weapons feel very nice (maybe not as good as D44M's, but still solid), enemies aren't too spongy (if you're not too careless with handling elemental and upgrade mechanics). The upgrade system is well-balanced and once you understand it, it's not too tedious. The elemental aspects and limited ammo gently encourage you to use different weapons. Lots of cool unique (being the key word here while comparing SW2 to Borderlands' formula of 'RNG' weapons) weapons that remain viable through most of the game. The music is great, especially the main theme and of course Stan Bush's tracks."
100,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"So many things were made wrong. I even don't know how to start this review. This all is related to my career. My player is an outside scorer, pg, 1.71m, has maxed stats and already has all necessary perks. Ok, and now tell me, why does the shooting skill depend on a person's height? Why can't a person who is 1.74m become as good at shooting as someone who is 1.71m? I'm 1.87m in real life, made my first player with this height and noticed then I cannot reach a higher skill than 89. Why? That's pure discrimination! And why doesn't the game tell me that before I create a character and not even when I reach the skill limit after weeks of playing?!?"
101,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"I think this assassin's creed nailed the mechanics on all fronts (ship battles, sailing, hunting (fish), parkour, etc). I felt much more connected to this character as well. The story starts out extremely rough but improves significantly as you play (i think this is true for every ac game personally). Edward was quite the interesting character and so were all the side characters. I felt like all the collectibles actually meant something in this ac game, which I never got from any of the previous ones. Maybe it's because I felt like they had a greater purpose in the game. They definitely were not required but they were fun to get and you got rewarded in a very balanced way."
102,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"While I personally cannot recommend this game, it wasn't absolutely terrible. The gunplay is decent, so long as you have the money to purchase gun parts, which would be my main complaint with this game: it's pay-to-win. If I could get past that, the game would be enjoyable, as the hardsuit is fun to use and HRV is a great idea. I'd take this game over any Call of Duty title any day, but its pay-to-win microtransaction format is off-putting for me. If you're fine with this model, then by all means, have fun. But if you're like me and dislike pay-to-win games, just let this one pass; it's not our cup of tea."
103,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"While not perfect, this game has been highly enjoyable. The save system and possibility of sudden death leads to some frustration. I'm on my first playthrough and I lost my main character around hour 10 of 20ish. Would have really appreciated a save to reload at that point. I've since picked up a 3rd party mod/save tool to avoid catastrophic failures. Plus the aiming reticle is on the small side and zoom is underpowered. With all that said, it's been a blast. I'm not typically a zombie fan, but the combination of strategy, missions, first-person shooter/beat 'em up is fantastic. I've been playing it as often as I can get away... Just one more mission, just one more supply run—or I'm running away and want to get safe before shutting the game down."
104,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"An absolutely great strategy game! Having played every single other wargame (European Escalation, and ALB), I have to say this one fits well. The number of units is great. Not sure exactly how many units there are, but there's a ton!!! Graphics are just beautiful, sounds are great, and the gameplay overall is epic. The in-game chat box at the main menu is very entertaining as well, no I am not kidding. However, if anyone thinks this game is 'easy', or if you are new to the strategy genre, it could take you quite some time to get it nailed down. Do not get upset, you will lose a lot of units. Just make sure you plan ahead, always have anti-air, and anti-tank."
105,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"I was negatively biased towards this game before I played it. Wasn't even sure about buying it. I dunno, the whole portal gun and portals thing seemed odd to me even though I like science fiction. Boy was I wrong. The jokes and voice acting in this game are phenomenal. Just amazing. It's not cheesy (ok it's sometimes cheesy). And each story character has their own sense of humour. Those different characters truly have distinct personalities. And the level design; it's just rad. Btw I never played the first Portal game. One of these days, I'm planning to if I can spare the time. I would never have played it if I hadn't tried the sequel."
106,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,Ok let's start with the pros(+) and cons(-) then my thoughts on this game. +some of the best characters +good story +lots of content +customizable character (you can be male or female whatever you like) +you can have a relationship with most of your companions(yes fangirls you can have a love interest) -bad graphics (I don't think graphics really matter anyway) -weird and awkward love scenes -invisible walls -there's one mission in my opinion was boring but everyone has different tastes -+ um this isn't really bad or good but for those who care your protagonist you made can't talk okay now for my thoughts. I love this game. This game is probably one of the best RPGs or games in general I have ever played. So if you're an RPG fan you probably already have this game.
107,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"Yes, this is a nostalgia trip for thirty-somethings who remember (at least in the UK) watching the ever-irritating Timmy Mallet just for the five-minute *Transformers* cartoon. The voice actors for Optimus, Megatron, Bumblebee, and many others are back, and instantly recognizable. The distinctive cartoon transformation sound is there. Graphically, the cel-shaded presentation is flawless, and very, very Generation One. But aside from that, it's actually a highly enjoyable game. The combat mechanics are exceptionally well done. Transforming mid-fight is often essential, and woven seamlessly into combos, making it quite unlike High Moon's outstanding *War for/Fall of Cybertron* games. Another distinction is the heavy focus on melee combat, but some enemies (e.g. Seekers) require switching to a ranged blaster."
108,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"I downloaded the game and played it for a while, and it was nothing special. I spent more time trying to log in than actually playing the game. There is a bug where it says there was an update to the terms of service, and whenever you click 'accept,' it just pops up again. You have to restart the client for it to work. Now that isn't too bad, but why do I need to link my Steam and Gface accounts? They say it's for DLC, but why is that even necessary? It's also irreversible, so now I know a company I don't care about has access to my Steam information. The game itself is mediocre. It's easily recognizable as a COD clone, except somehow they made the gunplay worse... How is that even possible?"

110,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"I experienced no performance issues even at launch, and after all these patches it plays really well. Imo, this is a truly great and fun game, although the format may be somewhat annoying (where the free-roam city area repopulates with new enemies every time you progress the story). I particularly enjoyed the 'dual play' segments (where you can play as Batman + 1 more), and the ability to use the controller for most parts of the game but the mouse and keyboard for the tank combat sections was greatly appreciated. Driving your batmobile around the free-roam city, including when chasing the apc commanders, is actually quite fun once you figure out how to use the brakes to skid around corners (and when you master that, driving around the city is really quite enjoyable!)"
111,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"Damn fine aaa fps shooter - that's the bottom line. It looks, sounds, and plays great - excellent fps mechanics, a compelling story, cool characters, flawless voice acting, and a badass soundtrack. Not for the faint-hearted though - some of those cutscenes were pretty darn brutal and vivid. But when a game is this good overall, it's easier to spot the flaws, and here they are as I saw 'em: - no SLI support - wtf? I had to shelve the game until I upgraded my card, as it ran too poorly on my old dual GPU GTX 590. Make sure you have a fairly decent single GPU card. - annoyingly small obstacles are often unclimbable."

The visuals are very sleek: no unnecessary details. Nice color schemes. It totally works for this game. The graphics can be set on 'high' without straining your system. I run this game on an i5 Pentium processor, with an NVIDIA GeForce 710M card - 8GB memory and it runs smoothly (Windows 8.1). - controls: the game can be played with a keyboard and mouse, but also with an Xbox controller."
113,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"You can see by the hours I put into this game that I enjoy it. This is everything I wished a search game from COD would be. But don’t buy this game thinking it’s like COD, Battlefield, or any other shooter game. It’s a game in its own class and should be treated as such. Can’t tell you how many times I hear new players whine and complain about getting killed really fast. Oh god forbid you get shot in the face and actually die. It's not like that doesn’t happen in real life or anything. Edit: Okay, so I’ve been playing this game for a while now. Thrown all kinds of money at it. One of the best MP games around. A good thing to play when you’re not feeling CS:GO."
114,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"I'm 2 hours in and am dying from this game. So hilarious. Gameplay is also solid, art design is stunning, music is surprisingly high quality and fitting, the story/world has me intrigued, and the puzzles are enjoyable. But the best thing about this game beyond all that is the comedy. If you've played any RPG since the dawn of video game RPGs you will laugh at the various jokes, parodies, and references; if you've never played an RPG before then you should still appreciate the game for its humor. If you played Final Fantasy 7 or X you absolutely need to play this game, without giving too much away... I had to actually stop playing after 2 hours to give my cheeks a break from laughing and smiling so much. What a delight so far."
115,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"I'm really sorry, I try to be supportive of free-to-play games and indie developers, but I really didn't enjoy this game. The description sounded perfect for me, but the execution did nothing for me. I love puzzle and exploration games, yet I found this game completely unintuitive, and even after looking up how to progress, I still simply didn't find the gameplay fun. It also lacks a pause button entirely, or if it does have one, I never found it. Considering that many sequences in the game are timed, this seems like a critical oversight. I also feel like this game has more cutscenes than gameplay, and I end up just sitting around drumming my fingers a lot."
116,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"This game.... Phew where to even start. It was absolutely beautiful, from story to graphics I was hooked. The story wasn’t just some tale but actually felt like I was that person, trying to figure out what came next in the journey my character was telling. Gameplay was great and I learned a lot about myself through this game (mainly my fear of heights which I never had a problem with until the ice caverns). My gut churned the whole time, but I pushed through for Uncle Fred! If you guys made a DLC or second game, I would be the first to buy it and recommend it to everyone I know. Thanks to everyone who was involved in making this, you created a truly beautiful game."
117,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth is a turn-based game in which you build your civilization toward a specific goal or 'victory'. In previous games, you progressed through Earth's timeline, advancing through periods like the Stone Age, Medieval Age, and the Modern Age; however, in this game, you are set in the future on a mission to colonize a new planet. What I enjoy about this game is that 2K took a fresh approach and introduced new mechanics such as the affinity system and orbital layer. What I didn’t enjoy was that with these new mechanics, the game could be overwhelming at times. What I think could be improved in this game is that they could incorporate some new artwork, such as the environment you experience when communicating with another leader."
118,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"Great game! Tons of replayability and a very fun zombie survival game! Definitely in my top 5 zombie games ever played. Edit: After playing 60+ hours, I can honestly say this is one of the better, more ''realistic'' zombie games. It's very much designed like a survival horror as you must conserve your ammo, heal your own wounds when you bleed out, take pills when you're infected, etc. Also, I find the zombies to feel very natural and well animated for a free-to-play game. P.S.: I would recommend getting 1 or 2 friends to play with, but the community is super friendly and you can usually make friends/talk with people in the chat or over voice comms."
119,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"02/07/2014 - It's a shame I can't fully recommend/enjoy this game because from the short time I've played it, I know I'd be addicted if it didn't have the following 2 game breakers. No Aussie servers - one red bar puts you at a severe disadvantage and creates unbearable lag. Mind you, I played through the offline training mode and it was stuttering/lagging as well (how does that even happen?). Combine that with the poor ping, and it just ruins the game. Everything artifacts like crazy - the menus, backgrounds, training and in-game. I've never had this happen before with this card and thought it might not like my OC. Set my GPU back to stock and sure enough, it didn't make a difference."
120,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"Very late last night I finished this. The story is not particularly deep or interesting, but what makes it stand out is the storytelling. The atmosphere is filled to the brim, and the many collectibles do a great job at fleshing it out. I did learn a lot about the world of Batman, so it was a little disappointing that so few bosses were in the game. Oh well, there are enough future games to rectify that. The combat is the right amount of challenging but leans more on the easy side. Leveling up Batman wasn't very satisfying. It's the gadgets you upgrade and acquire during the campaign that add nice new gameplay mechanics. Gaining access to previously unreachable areas creates a nice sense of progression."
121,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"'To the Moon' is no mere game... Nay, it is a veritable experience, and it was one of the best of my life at that. Think Telltale's *The Walking Dead* is sad? Hohoho! Well, it's no match for *To the Moon*! Never before have I been so moved yet fulfilled by something purely fictional. This masterpiece represents the pinnacle of storytelling in my opinion, and the soundtrack is a gorgeously charming and perfect accompaniment. Yes, the controls are a bit finicky and the gameplay is not the strong point, but the story is so fantastic that I did not care one bit. Plus, the humor of the game is great as well and it never intrudes upon the distinguished nature of the story... And the *Doctor Who* references are endless."
122,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"Bastion is a bloody brilliant game, with a truly great storyline. Set after a calamity occurs, you begin to rebuild on the bastion. There's quite a lot of choice in the game, with the option of what to build to give you an advantage, what weapons to use and what upgrades to apply to those weapons as well as what drinks to consume for bonus effects. The art style and music in the game are fantastic, everything looks so vibrant at times—who says the apocalypse has to be dull? Best of all, the game features narration based on your actions. So if you pick up a weapon then swap it for another in the armoury, the narration would mention you taking along the new weapon."
123,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"I had originally bought this game in early development, when the only currency was spacebux, and there was no 'tech tree'. This was when the game was great. All of the guns at this point were equally overpowered, so there was no issue with imbalance; everyone could kill everyone at any time. Also, the game used to provide unlimited gun slots and five loadouts. You would think that for a game with 'bajillions of guns', they would at least give you more than 6 weapon slots and 3 loadouts before you have to pay to unlock more. At one point, I had about 3 pages worth of guns, and was planning new ideas for more, because personally, that's where I found the fun."
124,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"This game was a surprising gem. One often sees rave reviews of certain products that are frequently misleading. In this case, the reviews reflect the fun of this neat little game. It is an odd mix between a classic 2D platformer and a MOBA, and executes it with style. I found myself enjoying characters that I wouldn’t like in other MOBA games. I had expected this trait to continue, but decided to give a melee tank a try anyway. I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome and ended up testing more as they were unlocked from playing matches. The art style and interface are oddly charming. As such, I now use one of the characters as my avatar and a wallpaper from designing a card set for the game."

It's been a while since a game has had that effect on me. The music sets the mood, the sound effects are spot on, and the controls are perfect. I look forward to every combat, and they've optimized combat extremely well. I had my doubts about the naval combat system, but it is so much fun to lay waste to multiple fleets at a time! The only way to lose in this game is to fail to retreat. If the combat looks overwhelming just get out of there, regroup, and counter-attack. Thanks, devs, for an awesome experience!"
126,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"The reboot of the Devil May Cry franchise has brought about many changes for the series, particularly for the series’ protagonist, Dante. While fans of the original games may be upset at the changes to their beloved character, it’s certainly for the better; and this new title by Ninja Theory proves it. DmC serves as the perfect entry point for newcomers to jump into the series. It shows the origins of an arrogant, cynical Dante, and it chronicles his journey from cynicism to selflessness. Throughout, the game weaves a clear narrative arc for the new Dante, making him a compelling character to follow. The story follows Dante as he’s thrust into the corrupt world he willfully chose to ignore."
127,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"Where do I start with this absolutely beautiful game? Its story is utterly charming. It has so much detail put into it, and it is a bundle of happiness, bad puns, annoying dogs, and secrets. It is serious when it needs to be, but isn’t a stranger to humor. The character design is on point, with various personalities and hidden depths. It stands out from other RPGs because you don’t have to kill anyone, a rare concept in the genre. With inspiration from EarthBound, one of the best RPGs I’ve played, you can tell it’s going to be great. It easily has the best soundtrack I’ve heard in years."
128,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"I am recommending this solely because it's free, and might be a more 'enjoyable' experience for others. As for my experience, the 'game' did nothing for me. Half the story relies on shock value. I was not shocked nor emotionally moved in any way by this. Maybe I'm desensitized, or maybe it was too simple to provoke a reaction out of me. As for the other half of the game, it attempts to paint a picture (literally) of a person in mental decline. It deals with obsession, hallucination, depression, and a few other themes. In theory, it is an interesting idea. But the 'game' took me 10 minutes to complete, and that includes reading and absorbing every little detail I could."

It is an excellent way to test your mind while still being fun. Although this game isn't as story-heavy, it did give rise to one of the most popular games of 2011. I still play this game and complete it when I am feeling bored, and I love to return and see what created a legend and what remains a legend. Gameplay: Portal's gameplay is quite simple, to explain at least. You use portals to your advantage, along with buttons that activate part of the puzzle. Two buttons are in the game, one that you press and one that requires a cube to place on."

Divinity: Dragon Commander comes awfully close to the borders of my personal favorite RTS game. Combine this with a huge Risk-like grand strategy mode and there, it hits the spot. I am not (read: try not to be) overly biased due to the fact that this game allows you to turn into a dragon, aiding your troops by supporting, attacking, and even commanding unit production, direction, and spawning simultaneously. Honestly, I do like the complicated RTS games nowadays. Think of Civ V and so on. However, such games attempt to cram complex mechanics, charts, and resources all into one overwhelming game mode."

The graphics are solid for a retro title and the music is pleasant, but paired together they craft some truly beautiful and impactful moments. The script runs the gamut from comedic to dramatic to heartbreaking to hopeful, sometimes all at once, and achieves this while turning RPG tropes on their head. And all of this without touching on the world, characters, story, gameplay... I could write whole pages about it. But instead, I'll just say this: if you like RPGs, play this game.

There is a fairly steep learning curve to the game's mechanics, which I am still trying to master; however, this depth of strategy allows you countless ways to achieve goals and capitalize on certain situations. The game, in my opinion, is almost infinitely replayable. I find myself engrossed in every session I play regardless of how the play-through unfolds."

After those enjoyable hours, you'll begin to notice that the only thing left the game offers is repetition in its combat, enemies, and gameplay. The major highlight is that the developers work hard and provide semi-frequent updates, often including substantial content from sweeping changes to game systems, new warframes, and other tweaks or features. It's a good game to play casually. Though I doubt it will hold your attention beyond a few months unless you truly enjoy grinding. The upside is that the game is free, so I'd recommend trying it. If you're looking for a quick fix, give it a shot."

Sadly, it's far from it. In this game, you go around absorbing ever bigger things to grow larger and absorb bigger objects. But the gameplay isn't as smooth as it could be, the levels lack creativity, and what is there feels like a surreal horror show. I don't mean an entertaining horror show but one that makes you feel depressed and question whether being alive is worth it. Every 'living' creature in this game, from small pets to human beings, makes me wonder if the creators had an interest in taxidermy."

I thought, ""Oh wow! A simulator of the road to becoming president! That sounds fun!"" Well, it really wasn't. The game starts you off and says you need to pick a side: Republican or Democrat—there is no independent or third party. A little disappointed, but still optimistic, I carried on to see what I could do. I will give the game credit: the character customization, although limited, is pretty fun to mess around with. It's the only time it's an option to wear your head or not in a campaign. Literally."

Some keys are hard coded and cannot be rebound. Bugs galore. My pipboy vanished permanently at one point, forcing me to research console commands to restore it. You don’t have to earn power armor—it’s practically handed to you early in the game, and power cores are abundant in trader shops. The value of power armor is greatly diminished compared to previous Fallout titles. The story is mediocre, and nearly everything about this game is average, except it doesn’t crash every 10 minutes like Fallout 3. It’s far more stable than Fallout 3. Is it better than Fallout 3? No. Is it better than New Vegas? No. This title was massively overhyped for how disappointing it truly is."

- 8.6 hrs to reach the end

What I liked:  
- Visuals up until the last level (ice caves)  
- Story isn't that great, but the ending (after the credits) made me not regret spending time on this game  

What I disliked:  
- Visuals in the last level are dull  
- Gameplay in the last level becomes much harder, turning it into a frustrating experience of repeating tasks until perfected  
- Achievements are too difficult. There are 13 (out of 15) that fewer than 2.1% of players have unlocked!"

Cons:

-enemies always seem to know your location once spotted  
-godlike enemy accuracy, which is as frustrating as in the first Ghost Warrior  
-terrible checkpoints and saves  
-boring story that I couldn't care less about  
Will not recommend unless it's 90% off—even then, playing this game feels like a tedious chore, just finishing it to move on to the next in my library. Given the time wasted on the first Ghost Warrior (equally dull, and I felt liberated upon completing it), I likely won't play this one to the end."

For one thing, I have a Vive and I'm much more interested in playing room-scale games with the controllers. Beyond that, the game is initially awe-inspiring in the scale of its universe, but I also felt that same scale was a hindrance to my enjoyment. The learning curve and the amount of time required to do anything interesting at the beginning were both too steep for me. Perhaps if I were more patient and had more time for gaming, this would be compelling to me. But I don't have either, and there are plenty more VR games I'd rather spend my time on."

Single hits to the chest, neck, or head from rifle-caliber weapons almost always result in death unless it just grazes you. Rounds drop over distance, and short, controlled bursts are required if you wish to stay on target. There is no magical ammunition pool. If you reload halfway through your magazine constantly, you will have a pouch full of half-empty mags. You can't run forever. If you sprint for a while, your aim will suffer as you gasp heavily until you catch your breath. Rest your weapon on your elbows while prone or on a windowsill to steady your aim.

I loved that game, however; it was unforgiving in the early stages but rewarding when you did things right. As for XCOM 2, I love it—the game runs pretty well for me on medium, and I’m using a GTX 560 with 2GB of VRAM. At first, the game set it to high, and it ran a bit sluggishly but not to the point of being unplayable. When I dropped it down to medium, it smoothed out. Not sure if I’m just lucky when it comes to having issues with games or what, but most of the negative reviews sound like they’re coming from some really entitled people."

The number of women purchasing programs to safeguard PCs from viruses, spam, and spyware attacks rose by 11.2% annually between 2002 and 2004. The study, conducted for net security firm Preventon, reveals that security messages are reaching a diverse range of internet users. It is estimated that 40% of those buying home net security programs are retired. Over the past three years, that figure has increased by an average of 13.2%. However, more retired women (53%) purchased security software than retired men. The research reflects shifting stereotypes and demographics of web users, as well as growing awareness of the heightened risks that high-speed broadband connections can pose to users."

But more and more iPod owners are using that space for audio content created by an unpredictable assortment of producers. It is called 'podcasting,' and its strongest advocate is former MTV host and VJ (video jockey) Adam Curry. Podcasting takes its name from the Apple iPod, although you do not need an iPod to create or listen to a podcast. A podcast is essentially an internet-based radio show that podcasters produce, often in the comfort of their own home. They need only a microphone, a PC, and some editing software.

Beyond coaxing ever larger and more tangible objects into a regime of quantum behavior, this new capability has inspired ideas of using mechanical oscillators in the processing and communication of quantum information and as precision force sensors operating beyond the standard quantum limit. However, the effectively linear interaction between motion and light or electricity prevents access to the broader class of quantum states of motion, such as cat states or energy squeezed states. Indeed, early optomechanical proposals noted the possibility to overcome this restriction by creating strong quadratic coupling of motion to light. Although there have been experimental demonstrations of quadratically coupled optomechanical systems, these have not yet achieved nonclassical states of motion."

Unfortunately, the evaluations can be manipulated using fake reviews (""spams"") by professional spammers, who have developed increasingly insidious and powerful spamming strategies by adapting to the deployed detectors. Spamming strategies are difficult to capture, as they can vary rapidly over time, differ across spammers and target products, and more critically, remain unknown in most cases. Furthermore, most existing detectors focus on detection accuracy, which is not well-aligned with the goal of maintaining the trustworthiness of product evaluations. To address these challenges, we formulate a minimax game where the spammers and spam detectors compete with each other on their practical objectives that are not solely based on detection accuracy. Nash equilibria of the game lead to robust detectors that are agnostic to any mixed detection strategies."

To ensure high fidelity, we employ the Lewis-Riesenfeld (L-R) method to derive a family of solutions enabling exact transfer, where the solutions follow a single dynamical mode of the L-R invariant. Among this family, we identify a tracking solution with a single parameter to simultaneously control the fidelity of the transfer, the population of the excited state, and robustness. We define a measure of the robustness of an uh-fidelity transfer as the minimum percentile deviation in the pulse areas at which the infidelity exceeds $10^{-4}$. The robustness of our shaped pulses is found superior to that of Gaussian and adiabatically-optimized pulses for moderate pulse areas."

Due to nonconvexity, there exist multiple local minima that are not globally optimal, even when the mixture is well-separated. We demonstrate that all local minima share the same structural form, which partially identifies the component centers of the true mixture. Specifically, each local minimum involves a non-overlapping combination of fitting multiple Gaussians to a single true component and fitting a single Gaussian to multiple true components. Our results apply to the setting where the true mixture components satisfy a certain separation condition and remain valid even when the number of components is over- or under-specified. For Gaussian mixtures with three components, we derive sharper results in terms of the scaling with the separation between the components."

A widely used tool for detecting entanglement is the entanglement witness, where the measurement of the witness operator is guaranteed to be positive for all separable states and can be negative for certain entangled states. In reality, due to the exponentially increasing Hilbert-space dimension with respect to the system size, it is very challenging to construct an efficient entanglement witness for general multipartite entangled states. For $n$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-like states, the most robust witness scheme requires $n+1$ local measurement settings and can tolerate up to $1/2$ white noise. In contrast, the most efficient witness for GHZ-like states only needs two local measurement settings and can tolerate up to $1/3$ white noise."

We develop a general method to extract the multipole moments of arbitrary stationary spacetimes and apply it to a broad family of horizonless microstate geometries. The latter can violate the axial and equatorial symmetry of the Kerr metric and exhibit a far richer multipolar structure, offering a pathway to constrain fuzzball models phenomenologically. We find numerical evidence that all multipole moments are typically larger (in absolute value) than those of a Kerr black hole with identical mass and spin. Current measurements of the quadrupole moment of black-hole candidates can impose only weak constraints on fuzzballs, while future gravitational-wave detections of extreme mass-ratio inspirals with the space mission LISA will refine these bounds by orders of magnitude."

We consider a common scenario in which edges can represent short-term interactions (e.g., messaging) or long-term structural connections (e.g., friendship). In practice, long-term edges are often specified by humans. Human-specified edges can be both costly to produce and suboptimal for the downstream task. To address these issues, we propose a model based on temporal point processes and variational autoencoders that learns to infer temporal attention between nodes by observing node communication. Since temporal attention drives feature propagation between nodes, using the dynamics of node interactions to learn this key component offers more flexibility while simultaneously avoiding issues associated with human-specified edges."
210,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"Observations of thermally driven transverse vibration of a photonic crystal waveguide (pcw) are reported. The pcw consists of two parallel nanobeams separated by a 240 nm vacuum gap. Models are developed and validated for the transduction of beam motion to phase and amplitude modulation of a weak optical probe propagating in a guided mode (gm) of the pcw for probe frequencies far from and near the dielectric band edge. Since our pcw has been designed for near-field atom trapping, this research provides a foundation for evaluating potential deleterious effects of thermal motion on optical atomic traps near the surfaces of pcws. Long-term goals include achieving strong atom-mediated links between individual phonons of vibration and single photons propagating in the gms of the pcw, thereby enabling optomechanics at the quantum level with atoms, photons, and phonons."
211,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"We establish natural splittings for the values of global Mackey functors at orthogonal, unitary, and symplectic groups. In particular, the restriction homomorphisms between the orthogonal, unitary, and symplectic groups of adjacent dimensions are naturally split epimorphisms. The interest in these splittings arises from equivariant stable homotopy theory. The equivariant stable homotopy groups of every global spectrum form a global Mackey functor, so the splittings imply that certain long exact homotopy group sequences split into short exact sequences. For the real and complex global Thom spectra $\mathbf{mo}$ and $\mathbf{mu}$, the splittings imply the regularity of various Euler classes related to the tautological representations of $O(n)$ and $U(n)$."
212,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"Baryonic feedback effects lead to a suppression of the weak lensing angular power spectrum on small scales. The poorly constrained shape and amplitude of this suppression is a significant source of uncertainty for upcoming cosmological weak lensing surveys such as *Euclid* or *LSST*. In this first paper of a two-part series, we use simulations to construct a *Euclid*-like tomographic mock dataset for the cosmic shear power spectrum and the corresponding covariance matrix, which are both adjusted for baryonic effects following the baryonification method of Schneider et al. (2019). Additionally, we develop an emulator to generate rapid predictions of the baryonic power suppression, enabling us to conduct a likelihood inference analysis for a standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with both cosmological and astrophysical parameters."
213,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"Spontaneous conversations in real-world settings such as those captured in child-centered recordings have been shown to be among the most challenging audio files to process. Nevertheless, developing speech processing models capable of handling such a wide variety of conditions would be particularly valuable for language acquisition studies in which researchers are interested in the quantity and quality of the speech that children hear and produce, as well as for early diagnosis and assessing effects of remediation. In this paper, we present our approach to designing an open-source neural network to classify audio segments into vocalizations produced by the child wearing the recording device, vocalizations produced by other children, adult male speech, and adult female speech. To this end, we compiled diverse child-centered corpora which amount to a total of 260 hours of recordings and cover 10 languages."
214,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"Density-based clustering relies on the idea of linking groups to certain specific features of the probability distribution underlying the data. The reference to a true, yet unknown, population structure allows us to frame the clustering problem in a standard inferential setting, where the concept of ideal population clustering is defined as the partition induced by the true density function. The nonparametric formulation of this approach, known as modal clustering, establishes a correspondence between the groups and the domains of attraction of the density modes. Operationally, a nonparametric density estimate is required, and a proper selection of the amount of smoothing, which governs the shape of the density and thus possibly the modal structure, is crucial to identify the final partition. In this work, we address the issue of density estimation for modal clustering from an asymptotic perspective."
215,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"The tails of diboson production at the LHC are sensitive to the interference between Standard Model and higher-dimension operators parameterizing the effects of heavy new physics. However, helicity selection rules for the diboson scattering amplitudes create an obstruction to the na\""ive interference contributions of dimension-six operators, causing the total diboson rate correction's leading contribution to cancel. In this case, precisely measuring the azimuthal decay angles ""resurrects"" the interference, restoring sensitivity to the ""non-interfering"" operators. We explore these signatures in detail, and find that the EFT uncertainties associated with higher-dimensional operators are uniquely well-suppressed by the construction of an asymmetry variable which is only generated by these non-interfering operators, relegating the effects of higher-dimensional, interfering operators to the same level as statistical errors in this observable."
216,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"Causal inference from observational data is the goal of many data analyses in the health and social sciences. However, academic statistics has often frowned upon data analyses with a causal objective. The emergence of the term ""data science"" provides a historic opportunity to redefine data analysis in such a way that it naturally accommodates causal inference from observational data. Like others before, we categorize the scientific contributions of data science into three classes of tasks: description, prediction, and counterfactual prediction (which includes causal inference). A clear classification of data science tasks is necessary to discuss the data, assumptions, and analytics required to successfully accomplish each task. We argue that a failure to adequately describe the role of subject-matter expert knowledge in data analysis is a source of widespread misunderstandings about data science."
217,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"The weak gravity conjecture (WGC) demands the existence of superextremal particles in any consistent quantum theory of gravity. The standard lore is that these particles are introduced to ensure that extremal black holes are either unstable or marginally stable, but it is unclear what is wrong if this does not occur. This note demonstrates that, for a generic Einstein quantum theory of gravity in AdS, exact stability of extremal black branes conflicts with rigorously proven quantum information theorems about entanglement entropy. Avoiding the contradiction leads to a nonperturbative version of the WGC, which reduces to the usual statement at weak coupling. The argument is general and does not rely on either supersymmetry or a specific UV completion, assuming only the validity of Einsteinian gravity, effective field theory, and holography."
218,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"Understanding how strongly correlated two-dimensional (2D) systems can give rise to unconventional superconductivity with high critical temperatures remains one of the major unsolved problems in condensed matter physics. Ultracold 2D Fermi gases have emerged as clean and controllable model systems to investigate the interplay of strong correlations and reduced dimensionality, but direct evidence of superfluidity in these systems has been lacking. Here, we demonstrate superfluidity in an ultracold 2D Fermi gas by moving a periodic potential through the system and observing no dissipation below a critical velocity v$_{\rm c}$. We measure v$_{\rm c}$ as a function of interaction strength and find a maximum in the crossover regime between bosonic and fermionic superfluidity. Our results establish ultracold Fermi gases as a powerful platform for studying the influence of reduced dimensionality on strongly correlated superfluids."
219,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"Ordinary differential equation (ODE) is a mathematical model used in various application areas such as climatology, bioinformatics, and chemical engineering due to its intuitive appeal for modeling. Despite ODE's wide usage in modeling, the frequent absence of analytic solutions makes it challenging to estimate ODE parameters from the data, particularly when the model has many variables and parameters. This paper proposes a Bayesian ODE parameter estimation algorithm that is fast and accurate even for models with numerous parameters. The proposed method approximates an ODE model with a state-space model based on equations of a numerical solver. It enables fast estimation by avoiding computations of a full numerical solution in the likelihood. The posterior is obtained by a variational Bayes method, more specifically, the approximate Riemannian conjugate gradient method (Honkela et al.)."
220,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"We study the transport properties and superconducting proximity effect in nsn junctions formed by a time-reversal symmetry broken Weyl semimetal (WSM) in proximity to an $s$-wave superconductor. We find that the differential conductance and induced pairing amplitudes strongly depend on the angle between the junction direction in real space and the axis separating the Weyl nodes in momentum space. We analyze the influence of a chiral chemical potential, i.e., the electron population imbalance between Weyl nodes of opposite chirality, on the transport characteristics of the junction. Notably, we observe a net spin polarization of Cooper pairs that are generated via Andreev reflection in the two WSM regions. The spin polarization is opposite in the two WSM regions and highly sensitive to the chirality imbalance and excitation energy."
221,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"Metal ion implantation into ceramics has been demonstrated to be an effective and controllable technique for modifying the surface electrical conductivity of the ceramic piece, and this approach has been used in numerous applications. Importantly, it provides a method for grading the voltage drop across high-voltage insulators, thereby increasing the maximum operational voltage that can be applied without surface flashover. However, a concern regarding this method is the long-term stability of the implantation-induced conductivity, particularly if the implanted metal species is easily oxidized. Here we report on our investigation of the long-term behavior of the surface conductivity of titanium-implanted alumina. The results indicate that after an initial drop of as much as 40% in the first few weeks following implantation, the conductivity exhibits only a very gradual decrease of about 10% over the subsequent year."
222,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"We introduce a novel skyrme-like conserved current in the effective theory of pions and vector mesons based on the concept of hidden local symmetry. The associated charge is equivalent to the skyrmion charge for any smooth configuration. Moreover, there exist singular configurations that can be identified as n_f=1 baryons charged under the new symmetry. Under this identification, the vector mesons act as the Chern-Simons vector fields residing on the quantum Hall droplet that forms the n_f=1 baryon. We propose that this current represents the correct effective expression for the baryon current at low energies. This proposal provides a unified description for the two types of baryons and enables them to continuously transform into one another in a natural way. Furthermore, Chern-Simons dualities on the droplet can be interpreted as a consequence of Seiberg-like duality between gluons and vector mesons."
223,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"Interfacial spin-orbit coupling in Josephson junctions offers an intriguing way to combine anomalous Hall and Josephson physics in a single device. We study theoretically how the superposition of both effects influences superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator/superconductor junctions' transport properties. Transverse momentum-dependent skew tunneling of Cooper pairs through the spin-active ferromagnetic insulator interface generates sizable transverse Hall supercurrents, which we refer to as anomalous Josephson Hall effect currents. We generalize the Furusaki-Tsukada formula, initially developed to quantify conventional (tunneling) Josephson currents, to evaluate the transverse current components and demonstrate that their amplitudes are highly tunable through the spin-orbit coupling strengths or the superconducting phase difference across the junction. As a distinct spectroscopic fingerprint of Josephson junctions, well-localized subgap bound states form near the interface."
224,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"Following the suggestion from the Monte Carlo experiments in Jiménez (J. Turbul. 2020), that dipoles are as significant to the dynamics of decaying two-dimensional turbulence as individual vortex cores, it is found that the kinetic energy of this flow is carried by elongated streams formed by the merging of dipoles. Vortices separate into a group of small fast-moving cores, and another group of larger slowly moving ones, which can be described as 'frozen' into a gradually evolving 'crystal'. The kinematics of both groups are quite distinct, and only the former is self-similar. The latter accounts for most of the kinetic energy of the flow, and its vortices form the dipoles and the streams. Mechanisms are discussed for the growth of this slow component."
225,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"Continuous-time quantum walks have proven to be an extremely useful framework for designing several quantum algorithms. Often, the running time of quantum algorithms in this framework is characterized by the quantum hitting time: the time required for the quantum walk to find a vertex of interest with high probability. In this article, we present improved upper bounds for the quantum hitting time that can be applied to several ctqw-based quantum algorithms. In particular, we apply our techniques to the glued-trees problem, improving its hitting time upper bound by a polynomial factor: from $o(n^5)$ to $o(n^2\log n)$. Furthermore, our methods also help exponentially improve the precision dependence of the continuous-time quantum walk based algorithm to find a marked node on any ergodic, reversible Markov chain by Chakraborty et al."

Dry (or the ""loss-cone"") EMRIs, previously considered as the main EMRI sources for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, are primarily produced by multi-body scattering in the nuclear star cluster and gravitational capture. In this letter, we highlight an alternative EMRI formation channel: (wet) EMRI formation assisted by the accretion flow around accreting galactic-center massive black holes (MBHs). In this channel, the accretion disk captures stellar-mass black holes that are initially moving on inclined orbits, and subsequently drives them to migrate towards the MBH—this process enhances the formation rate of EMRIs in such galaxies by orders of magnitude."

Under such circumstances, we still expect our recommender systems to attract the users initially so they decide to stay on the website and become active users. This problem falls into the new user cold-start category and is crucial to the development and even survival of a company. Existing works on user cold-start recommendation either require additional user efforts, e.g. setting up an interview process, or utilize side information [10] such as user demographics, locations, social relations, etc. However, users may not be willing to take the interview, and side information for cold-start users is often unavailable."
228,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"Deep learning has solved many problems that are beyond the reach of heuristic algorithms. It has also been successfully applied in wireless communications, even though current radio systems are well-understood and optimal algorithms exist for many tasks. While some gains have been achieved by learning individual parts of a receiver, a better approach is to jointly learn the entire receiver. This, however, often results in a challenging nonlinear problem, for which the optimal solution is impractical to implement. To this end, we propose a deep fully convolutional neural network, deeprx, which executes the entire receiver pipeline from frequency domain signal stream to uncoded bits in a 5G-compliant fashion. We enable accurate channel estimation by constructing the input of the convolutional neural network in a very specific manner using both the data and pilot symbols."
229,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"Mutation-based fuzzing typically uses an initial set of non-crashing seed inputs (a corpus) from which to generate new inputs by mutation. A corpus of potential seeds often contains thousands of similar inputs. This lack of diversity can lead to wasted fuzzing effort through exhaustive mutation of all available seeds. To address this, fuzzers include distillation tools (e.g., afl-cmin) that select the smallest subset of seeds triggering the same range of instrumentation data points as the full corpus. Common practice suggests that minimizing the number and cumulative size of the seeds improves fuzzing efficiency, which we explore systematically. We present results of 34+ cpu-years of fuzzing with five distillation approaches to evaluate their impact on finding bugs in real-world software."
230,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"In this paper we investigate multi-agent discrete-event systems with partial observation. The agents can be divided into several groups in each of which the agents have similar (isomorphic) state transition structures, and thus can be relabeled into the same template. Based on the template, a scalable supervisor whose state size and computational cost remain independent of the number of agents is designed for partial observation. The scalable supervisor under partial observation does not require recomputation regardless of how many agents are added to or removed from the system. We extend our earlier results to partial observation by proposing sufficient conditions for safety and maximal permissiveness of the scalable least restrictive supervisor on the template level. An example is provided to demonstrate the proposed scalable supervisory synthesis."
231,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"Electric network frequency (ENF) fluctuations constitute a powerful tool in multimedia forensics. An efficient approach for ENF estimation is introduced with temporal windowing based on the filter-bank Capon spectral estimator. A form of Gohberg-Semencul factorization of the model covariance matrix is used due to the Toeplitz structure of the covariance matrix. Moreover, this approach employs, for the first time in the field of ENF, a temporal window, not necessarily rectangular, at the stage preceding spectral estimation. Krylov matrices are utilized for fast implementation of matrix inversions. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in ENF estimation when a short time window of $1$ second is used in power recordings. In speech recordings, the proposed approach yields highly accurate results in terms of both time complexity and accuracy."

As a corollary, regularized regression estimators based on these reduced dimension spaces are provided as well, ranging from classical principal component regression up to sparse partial robust M regression. The package also includes a set of classical and robust pre-processing utilities, such as generalized spatial signs, along with dedicated plotting functionality and cross-validation utilities. Finally, direpack has been designed consistent with the scikit-learn API, ensuring the estimators can seamlessly be integrated into (statistical and/or machine) learning pipelines within that framework."
233,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"The nonlinear fluorescence emission has been widely applied for high spatial resolution optical imaging. Here, we investigated the fluorescence anomalous saturating effect of the nitrogen vacancy defect in diamond. The fluorescence reduction was observed under high power laser excitation. It enhanced the nonlinearity of the fluorescence emission and altered the spatial frequency distribution of the fluorescence image. We employed a differential excitation protocol to extract the high spatial frequency information. By modulating the excitation laser's power, the spatial resolution of imaging was improved approximately 1.6 times compared to confocal microscopy. Due to the simplicity of the experimental setup and data processing, we expect this method can be utilized for improving the spatial resolution of sensing and biological labeling with defects in solids."
234,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"When random effects are correlated with sample design variables, the standard approach of using individual survey weights (constructed to be inversely proportional to the unit survey inclusion probabilities) to form a pseudo-likelihood no longer yields asymptotically unbiased inference. We develop a weight-exponentiated formulation for the random effects distribution that ensures unbiased inference for generating hyperparameters of the random effects. We compare our approach with frequentist methods that depend on numerical integration to show that only the Bayesian method achieves both unbiased estimation with respect to the sampling design distribution and consistency with respect to the population generating distribution. Our simulations and real data example for a survey of business establishments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across different modeling formulations and sampling designs. This work serves as a culmination of recent developmental efforts that integrate traditional survey estimation approaches with the Bayesian modeling framework and provides a connection between these two rich but distinct sub-fields."

For the first time, it was found that in a mesogenic polymer, unlike low-molecular-weight mesogens, the relaxation of the electric birefringence of a melt above the temperature of the nematic-isotropic phase transition can be described by a sum of several exponential processes, two of which play a decisive role. These primary processes replace each other in a temperature range of about fifty degrees. Dielectric spectroscopy also revealed two processes of orientational relaxation: the first is due to rotation of the side mesogenic groups, and the second is associated with motion of the main chain segments."
237,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"Deep hashing methods have demonstrated great retrieval accuracy and efficiency in large-scale image retrieval. Optimizing discrete hash bits remains a key focus in deep hashing methods. A common strategy in these methods is to employ an activation function, e.g. $\operatorname{sigmoid}(\cdot)$ or $\operatorname{tanh}(\cdot)$, and minimize a quantization loss to approximate discrete values. However, this approach may cause more hash bits to become trapped in the wrong saturated regions of the activation functions without escaping. We refer to this issue as the ""dead bits problem (dbp)."" Additionally, existing quantization loss can worsen dbp. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective gradient amplifier applied before activation functions to mitigate dbp."

The former is constrained by disappearing charged track searches at the LHC and by dark matter direct detection experiments, while the latter is limited by existing multilepton collider searches. We find that a two-step electroweak phase transition involving a stable triplet with a negative quadratic term is excluded by direct detection searches, while an unstable triplet with a mass below $230\ \mathrm{GeV}$ is ruled out at $95\%$ confidence level."

The standard scenario assumes an initially circular and narrow belt of planetesimals at semi-major axis \(a\), whose eccentricity is raised to \(e_f\) after the gas disc has dispersed by secular perturbations from an eccentric planet, resulting in a belt of width \(2ae_f\). In a slight modification of this scenario, narrower belts can form if the planetesimals are initially eccentric, which could arise from earlier planet perturbations during the gas-rich protoplanetary disc phase. However, a primordial eccentricity might alternatively be caused by instabilities that increase the disc eccentricity, without requiring any planets."

Here, we report measurements of many-body modes in 1D gated wires using a tunneling spectroscopy technique. We observe two distinct Fermi seas at high energies, linked to spin and charge excitations, along with the emergence of three additional 1D 'replica' modes that intensify with decreasing wire length.

In this paper, we identify a surprising consequence of popularity-based rankings: the fewer the items reporting a given signal, the larger the share of the overall traffic they collectively attract. This few-get-richer effect emerges in settings where there are few distinct categories of items (e.g., left-leaning news sources versus right-leaning news sources), and items are ranked based on their popularity. We demonstrate analytically that the few-get-richer effect arises when people tend to click on top-ranked items and have diverse preferences for the classes of items. Using simulations, we examine how the strength of the effect varies with assumptions about the setting and human behavior. We also test our predictions experimentally in an online study with human participants. Our findings have important implications for understanding the spread of misinformation."

To address this problem, we introduce a new sparsity dimension, namely pattern-based sparsity, which comprises pattern and connectivity sparsity, and achieves both high accuracy and hardware efficiency. With carefully designed patterns, the proposed pruning method consistently achieves accuracy improvement and enhanced feature extraction capability across various DNN architectures and datasets. Our pattern-aware pruning framework also enables pattern library extraction, pattern selection, pattern and connectivity pruning, and weight training simultaneously. Our approach to pattern-based sparsity naturally aligns with compiler optimization for highly efficient DNN execution on mobile platforms."

And I realized that what I'd really like is to look at you as much as you're looking at me — just to even things out a little. So if I had way more eyeballs, then we'd all be really comfortable, right?"

It's a great critique of multitasking, isn't it, often attributed to the Roman writer Publilius Syrus, although you know how these things are, he probably never said it. What I'm interested in, though, is — is it true? I mean, it's clearly true for emailing at the dinner table or texting while driving or possibly for live tweeting at a TED Talk, as well. But I'd like to argue that for an important kind of activity, doing two things at once — or three or even four — is precisely what we should be aiming for. Look no further than Albert Einstein. In 1905, he published four remarkable scientific papers."

We would build projects together, like model rockets and slot cars. Here's the go-kart that we built together. That's me behind the wheel, with my sister and my best friend at the time. And one day, he came home, when I was about 10 years old, and at the dinner table, he announced that for our next project, we were going to build ... a robot."

I want to know how they rely on the water's bounty for their livelihood. Understanding all of this enables us to shift our perception of seafood away from a commodity to an opportunity to restore our ecosystem. It allows us to celebrate the seafood that we're so fortunate to enjoy. So what do we call this? I think we call it restorative seafood. Where sustainability is the capacity to endure and maintain, restorative is the ability to replenish and progress."

The stone-hearted miser haunted by the ghost of Christmas past. More than a century after his death, these remain iconic figures from the work of Charles Dickens. So striking is his body of work that it gave rise to its own adjective. But what are the qualities of Dickens's writing that make it so special? Dickens’s fiction brims with tension through brooding settings, plot twists, and mysteries. These elements of his work kept his audience eager for more. When first published, his stories were serialized, meaning they were released a few chapters at a time in affordable literary journals and only later reprinted as books."

Because we were so engrossed, we wanted to watch the games live, and we decided that one of the Spanish-speaking networks in the US was the best place for us to start.

Now, I want to share this because their form of money is truly fascinating. They used these limestone discs called rai stones. However, the Yap didn’t actually move these rai stones around or exchange them the way we do with our coins, because rai stones can be quite massive. The largest is about four tons and 12 feet across. So the Yap simply kept track of who owned part of which stone. There's a tale about some sailors transporting a stone across the ocean when they encountered trouble and the stone sank into the sea."

If you insist that you’re innocent anyway, you’ll likely be found guilty and executed. But if you confess, apologize, and implicate others for good measure, you’ll go free. Do you give a false confession—or risk a public hanging? This was the dilemma facing those accused of witchcraft in the village of Salem, Massachusetts, between February 1692 and May 1693. They were the victims of paranoia about the supernatural, misguided religious fervor—and a justice system that valued repentance over truth. Salem was settled in 1626 by Puritans, a group of English Protestants. Life was strict and isolated for the people of Salem. Conflicts with their Native American neighbors and groups of French settlers were commonplace."

Unfortunately, there aren’t nearly enough donor organs available to meet that demand. What if instead of waiting, we could create brand-new, customized organs from scratch? That’s the idea behind bioprinting, a branch of regenerative medicine currently under development. We’re not yet able to print complex organs, but simpler tissues including blood vessels and tubes responsible for nutrient and waste exchange are already within our grasp. Bioprinting is a biological cousin of 3-D printing, a technique that deposits layers of material on top of each other to construct a three-dimensional object one slice at a time."

Brian Burton, aka Danger Mouse, takes The Beatles' *White Album*, combines it with Jay-Z's *The Black Album* to create *The Grey Album*. *The Grey Album* becomes an instant sensation online, and The Beatles' record company sends out numerous cease-and-desist letters for 'unfair competition and dilution of our valuable property.'

So if you think of a map of your country, I believe you'll realize that for every country on earth, you could draw small circles to say, 'these are places where good teachers won't go.' On top of that, those are the places from where trouble arises. So we have an ironic problem — good teachers don't want to go to just those places where they're needed the most. I started in 1999 to try and address this issue with an experiment, which was a very simple experiment in New Delhi."

And I ask my students these two questions, then I share how I answer them, which is in these three sentences: I am the daughter of Black writers, who are descended from freedom fighters who broke their chains and changed the world.

This small metal sphere, less than two feet in diameter, ignited a space race between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. that would last for eighteen years and change the world as we know it. Sputnik was actually not the first piece of human technology to enter space. That distinction belongs to the V-2 rocket used by Germany in missile attacks against Allied cities as a last-ditch effort in the final years of World War II. It wasn't very effective, but, at the end of the war, both the U.S. and U.S.S.R. had seized the technology and the scientists who developed it, using them for their own projects."

From my experience and that of the women around me, I can tell you that it's exhausting. It's exhausting to carefully pull out a brown paper bag hiding a pad, stuffing it into your pocket in the middle of a class and rushing to the washroom as discreetly as possible.

His skin was covered in painful scabs, and he wondered why he alone had been cursed with this affliction.

At the time, there wasn't much information about the company, but the little available was truly impressive. Essentially, the company was developing a medical device that could run your entire blood panel from a finger-stick of blood. This meant you wouldn't need a large needle in your arm to complete your blood test.

In this community, we didn't have a television; we didn't have computers, obviously, or radio. We didn't even have a telephone. All of my time was spent outside with the Inuit, playing.

That's our job: contain them, control them. Over the years, as a prison system, as a nation, and as a society, we've become very effective at that, but that shouldn't make you proud.

In order to do that, I need to explain something about the origin of the solar system. When we go back four and a half billion years, there was a cloud of gas and dust. In the center of this cloud, our sun formed and ignited. Along with that, what we now know as planets, comets, and asteroids formed. What then happened, according to theory, is that when the Earth had cooled slightly after its formation, comets massively impacted the planet and delivered water. They probably also brought complex organic material to Earth, and that may have triggered the emergence of life."

President Theodore Roosevelt slept in a grove of towering sequoia trees, camped in a snowstorm, and spent hours talking around the campfire with his host and guide, conservationist John Muir. Roosevelt famously loved the outdoors, but Muir had invited him there for more than just camping: Yosemite was in danger. Though Yosemite became protected land in 1864, the valley was still at risk of overdevelopment in 1903. It was at the heart of a decades-long struggle to set aside land for both preservation and public use—two goals that were much easier said than done. The battle over Yosemite began with the 1849 Gold Rush, when miners surged west, seeking gold in the Sierra Nevada foothills."

As a young reporter, I thought that I should approach it differently, so that it would have maximum impact, since everyone knew it was happening, yet nothing was being done to stop it. So I decided to go there and act as a seller. As part of selling, I was able to document solid evidence. The impact was great. It was fantastic.

So how can you avoid being misled by flashy headlines? The best way to assess a headline’s credibility is to examine the original research it references.

You must permanently leave reality behind, but you'll hardly notice the difference. Your experiences will be indistinguishable from reality.

Carbon operates in a natural cycle, present in all living things: in the soil, in the oceans, in the atmosphere and in rocks deep underground. When plants and other organisms die, much of their stored carbon returns to the atmosphere until new plants grow and reabsorb the carbon. But over millions of years, some of the carbon stored in ancient trees and sea life turns into rock and some becomes fossil fuels: coal, oil and natural gas. Natural events like volcanic eruptions release some of the carbon trapped in rock. And human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, also release some of that ancient carbon. Today, humans emit around 60 times more carbon than all the volcanoes on the planet each year."

Yet one of the greatest differences between natural and human technologies relates to robustness. Robust systems remain stable in complex and new environments. Remarkably, cockroaches can self-stabilize while running over rough terrain. When we attach a jet pack to them, or introduce a disturbance like an earthquake, we found that their perfectly tuned legs allow them to self-stabilize without using any of their brainpower. They can navigate complex terrain like grass effortlessly, without losing balance. We observed a new behavior where, due to their shape, they automatically roll onto their side to traverse this artificial patch of grass. Robust systems can perform multiple tasks with the same structure. Here's a new behavior we've uncovered."

We can transmit really complex thoughts to one another. So what I'm doing right now is, I'm making sounds with my mouth as I'm exhaling. I'm producing tones and hisses and puffs, and those are creating air vibrations in the air. Those air vibrations are traveling to you, they're hitting your eardrums, and then your brain takes those vibrations from your eardrums and transforms them into thoughts. I hope. (laughter) I hope that's happening. So because of this ability, we humans are able to share our ideas across vast reaches of space and time. We're able to transmit knowledge across minds."
298,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,speech,"There's this quote by activist and punk rock musician Jello Biafra that I love. He says, 'Don't hate the media. Be the media.' I'm an artist. I enjoy working with media and technology because, first, I'm familiar with them and appreciate the power they hold. And second, I despise them and I'm terrified of the power they hold. (Laughter) I remember watching, in 2003, an interview between Fox News host Tony Snow and then-US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. They were discussing the recent invasion of Iraq, and Rumsfeld is asked the question, 'Well, we hear about our body counts, but we never hear about theirs—why?' And Rumsfeld's answer is, 'Well, we don't do body counts on other people.'"

It’s 1988, and scientist James Hansen has just testified to the United States Congress that global warming trends are caused by human activity and will pose an increasing threat to humanity in the future. Well, well. That’s unusually prescient for a human. Looking for a wedding dress? Try a fresh take on a timeless classic. It’s sleek, flattering, and modest—just like the traditional dress. Commercials. Could anything be more insufferable? It’s 1997, and the United States Senate has called a hearing about global warming. Some expert witnesses note that past periods in Earth’s history were warmer than the 20th century."
300,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,speech,"Someone once said that politics is, of course, ""showbiz for ugly people."" So, on that basis, I feel like I've truly arrived. The other thing to consider is what an honor it is, as a politician, to give a TED Talk, particularly here in the U.K., where the reputation of politics, with the expenses scandal, has fallen so low. There was even a story recently that scientists had considered replacing rats in their experiments with politicians. And someone asked, ""Why?"" and they said, ""Well, there's no shortage of politicians, no one really cares what happens to them and, after all, there are some things that rats simply won't do."" (Laughter) Now, I know you all love data, so I'm starting with a data-rich slide."
