Here's my rundown; last night we watched *Thirteen*, a film every mother of a teen should see. It was better than I expected. Then we watched *Gigli*—yeah, it was just as bad as the media said, but we had to see for ourselves.""

But now there are two great new shows on and I have been watching both religiously for the last week. *Blow Out*, the gayest concept ever that seemingly has zero gay people in sight. Hairstylist Jonathan Antin wants to build a second location to his incredibly popular West Hollywood salon, but this time in Beverly Hills. Normally no one would care, certainly not me, but as I was flipping through the channels I caught a glimpse of Jonathan, equally narcissistic and dull, looking at an empty space on Rodeo Dr. saying (in a public voice), 'I am going to build here the greatest salon in the history of the world ever!' and I was hooked. Not since Rocco have I found such a moron compelling to watch.""

Re: Loss of Continuity in PX Day-Ahead Auction Due to ISO Rule Changes  

The emergency tariff filing by the California ISO last Friday has negatively impacted the PX day-ahead auction market. The combination of soft and hard caps creates a complete disconnect and unacceptable risk for all participants and will likely fail to deliver the ISO’s intended reduction in real-time energy sales and procurement. The overall effect will be that supply will still defer to the higher realized price opportunity the ISO offers. The PX is petitioning Terry Winter of the ISO to immediately permit adjustment bids on any submitted schedule at any relevant price.""

You might also be interested to know that I spoke at length today with Lad Lorenz, and like most parties involved in this proceeding, SoCal Gas is quite tired of this dispute. Lad doesn't expect that SoCal will file any kind of substantive challenge to the CPUC's decision. Of course, SoCal will ultimately take the lead in drafting the tariff sheets that implement the terms of the settlement. I told him that, most likely, TW will oversee the implementation phase of the proceeding but was probably not going to mount any serious challenge to the CPUC's decision.

As of writing this review (26/10/2013), there is a game-breaking bug that prevents a side mission from ever being completed (main story unaffected).

The upgrade system is well balanced and once you get used to it, it's not too tedious. The elemental mechanics and limited ammo gently encourage you to use different weapons.

Transforming mid-fight is often a necessity, and woven seamlessly into combos, making it quite unlike High Moon's outstanding *War for/Fall of Cybertron* games.

I found myself enjoying characters that I wouldn’t like in other MOBA games. I had expected this trait to continue but decided to give a melee tank a try anyway. I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome and ended up testing more as they were unlocked through gameplay. The art style and interface are oddly charming. As such, I now use one of the characters as my avatar and a wallpaper from designing a card set for the game.""

The latter can violate the axial and equatorial symmetry of the Kerr metric and exhibit a far richer multipolar structure, which offers a portal to constrain fuzzball models phenomenologically. We find numerical evidence that all multipole moments are typically larger (in absolute value) than those of a Kerr black hole with identical mass and spin.

The nonparametric formulation of this approach, known as modal clustering, establishes a correspondence between the groups and the domains of attraction of the density modes. Operationally, a nonparametric density estimate is required, and a proper selection of the amount of smoothing, which governs the shape of the density and thus possibly the modal structure, is crucial to identify the final partition. In this work, we address the issue of density estimation for modal clustering from an asymptotic perspective.""

In this case, precise measurements of the azimuthal decay angles ""resurrect"" the interference, restoring sensitivity to the ""non-interfering"" operators. We examine these signatures in detail and find that the EFT uncertainties linked to higher-dimensional operators are uniquely well-suppressed by constructing an asymmetry variable generated solely by these non-interfering operators, relegating the effects of higher-dimensional, interfering operators to the same level as statistical errors in this observable."

The stone-hearted miser haunted by the ghost of Christmas past. More than a century after his death, these remain iconic figures from the work of Charles Dickens. So striking is his body of work that it gave rise to its own adjective. But what are the features of Dickens's writing that make it so special? Dickens’s fiction brims with tension through brooding settings, plot twists, and mysteries. These elements of his work kept his audience craving more. When first published, his stories were serialized, meaning they were released a few chapters at a time in affordable literary journals and only later reprinted as books.""

261,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,speech,"You’ve been accused of a crime you did not commit. It’s impossible to prove your innocence. If you insist that you’re innocent anyway, you’ll likely be found guilty and executed. But if you confess, apologize, and implicate others for good measure, you’ll go free. Do you give a false confession—or risk a public hanging? This was the dilemma facing those accused of witchcraft in the village of Salem, Massachusetts, between February 1692 and May 1693. They were the victims of paranoia about the supernatural, misdirected religious fervor—and a justice system that prioritized repentance over truth. Salem was settled in 1626 by Puritans, a group of English Protestants. Life was strict and isolated for the people of Salem. Conflicts with their Native American neighbors and groups of French settlers were commonplace.""

I'll begin with an anecdote, or for those of you who are Monty Python lovers, a Monty Python-style sketch. Here it is. It is December 15, 2010. Someone gives you a bet: you will look into a crystal ball, and you will see the future; the future will be accurate. But you must share it with the world.

With the majority of refugees living in urban areas, there is a pressing need for a paradigm shift and innovative thinking. Rather than wasting money on building walls, it would be wiser to invest in programs that empower refugees to support themselves. (applause) We always have to leave behind all our possessions. But not our skills and knowledge. If permitted to live productive lives, refugees can help themselves and contribute to their host country's development.

269,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,speech,"On October 4, 1957, the world watched in awe and fear as the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the world's first artificial satellite, into space. This small metal sphere, less than two feet in diameter, ignited a space race between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. that would last for eighteen years and transform the world as we know it. Sputnik was not the first piece of human technology to reach space. That distinction belongs to the V-2 rocket employed by Germany in missile attacks against Allied cities as a desperate measure in the final years of World War II. It wasn't very effective, but, by the war's end, both the U.S. and U.S.S.R. had seized the technology and the scientists behind it, using them for their own projects."

From my experience and that of the women around me, I can tell you that it's exhausting. It's exhausting to carefully pull out a brown paper bag hiding a pad, stuffing it into your pocket in the middle of a class and rushing to the washroom as discreetly as possible.

His skin was covered in painful sores, and he wondered why he alone had been marked with this affliction. One day, while the supreme spirit Yaya was out in his gardens, Deminan and his brothers sneaked into Yaya’s house. After feasting and exploring, they spotted a giant gourd hanging in the corner.

At the time, there wasn't much information about the company, but the little available was truly impressive. Essentially, the company was developing a medical device that could run your entire blood panel using just a finger-stick of blood. This meant you wouldn't need a large needle inserted in your arm to complete your blood test. This was intriguing not only because it was less painful, but also because it could potentially open the door to predictive diagnostics."

In order to do that, I need to explain something about the origin of the solar system. When we go back four and a half billion years, there was a cloud of gas and dust. In the center of this cloud, our sun formed and ignited. Along with that, what we now know as planets, comets, and asteroids formed. What then happened, according to theory, is that when Earth had cooled down a bit after its formation, comets massively impacted the planet and delivered water. They probably also delivered complex organic material, and that may have bootstrapped the emergence of life.""

But the events of this past week—the horrific death of George Floyd and the ongoing protests that have followed—they’ve brought a new urgency, which we, of course, must address. Can we truly build back better from this? Before we can even begin to answer that question, we need to grasp the enormity of this moment.
