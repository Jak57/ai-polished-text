One of them, 'Blow Out,' is a groundbreaking concept that defies expectations with its unique blend of humor and heart. Despite the lack of any discernible LGBTQ+ characters, hairstylist Jonathan Antin's ambition to open a second location of his popular West Hollywood salon in Beverly Hills has piqued my interest. As I flipped through the channels, I stumbled upon a clip of Jonathan enthusiastically exclaiming, 'I'm going to build the greatest salon in the history of the world!' in a voice that is equal parts narcissistic and endearing. It's been a while since I've found myself invested in a character as unapologetically absurd as Jonathan, and I can't wait to see what he has in store for us."

Each of these works offered a unique perspective on the human condition, delving into themes of environmental degradation, social upheaval, and the resilience of the human spirit.

While 'Heavy Weather' was a gripping cyberpunk romp through a near-future USA, I found myself yearning for a deeper emotional connection with the characters and story.

At its core, Magic: The Gathering is a social game meant to be enjoyed with friends (or frenemies) - laughing, trash-talking, and dropping game-winning bombs. However, Wizards of the Coast has seemingly forgotten this. If you choose to play with friends, you can't earn gold, and gold is crucial. Gold unlocks everything in the game, so it's understandable that they've implemented a daily cap. But be prepared for a grueling and dull 1v1 grind against the computer or random opponents, whom you can't even speak to.

While they offer more storywise, the combat can feel sloppy and doesn't feel as sharp as Arkham City. As of writing this recommendation (10/26/2013), there is a game-breaking bug that prevents a side mission from being completed (main story unaffected). Some gadgets are placed at an absurdly hotkey, requiring a significant amount of keyboard travel to access. While it may seem minor, this can lead to frustration in the heat of combat."

The elemental stuff and limited ammo forces you to use different weapons. There are plenty of cool, unique weapons that remain viable throughout the game.

Transforming mid-fight is often a necessity, and it's woven seamlessly into combos, making it quite unlike High Moon's excellent War for Cybertron games.

I learned a great deal about the Caped Crusader's universe, which was a nice surprise. However, I was disappointed that only a few bosses were included in the game. Nonetheless, there is always the opportunity to improve upon this in future titles. The combat is well-balanced and challenging, but it is also on the easier side.

The impending deadline marks the point at which Fiat will gain the right to sell its car division to GM, as per the alliance agreed upon in 2000. However, GM, whose European operations have been losing money, is no longer interested in owning the unprofitable Fiat unit. Reports of stalled negotiations have sent Fiat shares plummeting 1.2% on Tuesday, following a 4% gain on Monday, fueled by hopes of a resolution. GM is believed to be offering around $2 billion to extricate itself from the arrangement, citing Fiat's decision to divest its finance arm and halve GM's stake through a capital-raising initiative as the deal's voiding factor.

Instead of relying on voltage drop sensing, the proposed system revolutionizes the field by measuring the pulse width, or the time it takes for the voltage to return to its baseline, providing a more accurate and efficient means of radiation detection.

The prototype ASIC, fabricated in TSMC's 65 nm LP CMOS process, consumes an average static power of just 0.535 mW under 1.2 V analog and digital power supply, making it a power-efficient and compact solution. To further validate the system's functionality, the authors successfully verified its operation in a clinical 67.5 MeV proton beam setting, marking a significant breakthrough in the field of radiation detection.

Our approach leverages a time regularization technique to maintain the stability properties of symplectic integrators while significantly reducing the effective step size during close encounters. By employing a high-order MVS scheme, we are able to integrate systems with large time steps far away from close encounters, ensuring accurate long-term behavior. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm by applying it to a system of six super-Earths undergoing strong scattering over a period of 50,000 years.

A widely used tool for detecting entanglement is entanglement witness, which measures the witness operator and is guaranteed to be positive for separable states and can be negative for entangled states. In reality, due to the exponentially increasing Hilbert space dimension with respect to the system size, it is very challenging to construct an efficient entanglement witness for general multipartite entangled states. For $n$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-like states, the most robust witness scheme requires $n+1$ local measurement settings and can tolerate up to $1/2$ white noise. As a comparison, the most efficient witness for GHZ-like states only needs two local measurement settings and can tolerate up to $1/3$ white noise."

By developing a general method to extract the multipole moments of arbitrary stationary spacetimes, we are able to apply this approach to a vast array of horizonless microstate geometries. These spacetimes can break the axial and equatorial symmetry of the Kerr metric, resulting in a richer multipolar structure that serves as a valuable tool for constraining fuzzball models. Our findings indicate that the multipole moments of these spacetimes are typically more pronounced than those of a Kerr black hole with the same mass and spin, and current measurements of the quadrupole moment of black-hole candidates provide only limited constraints on fuzzballs. However, future gravitational-wave detections of extreme mass-ratio inspirals with the Lisa mission will significantly improve these bounds, providing a more detailed understanding of the structure of these exotic objects."

The proposed framework aims to alleviate issues associated with human-specified edges, which can be both expensive to produce and suboptimal for downstream tasks.
 The key idea is to learn temporal attention between nodes by observing node interactions over time. This is achieved by using temporal point processes to model the dynamics of node interactions and variational autoencoders to infer temporal attention between nodes.
The proposed framework consists of two main components:
1. Temporal Point Processes (TPPs): TPPs are used to model the dynamics of node interactions over time. TPPs are based on the idea of a point process, where each node in the graph is represented by a point in a high-dimensional space. The position of each point in this space captures the state of the node at a given time step.

 The global Thom spectra $\mathbfmo$ and \mathbfmu$ are certain spectra of sheaves of sets that are associated to the topological space $X$ and the smooth structure on $X$. The splittings of the Thom spectra imply that certain long exact homotopy groups separate into short exact sequences of the form $1 \to \pi_i(X) \to \pi_i(X,A) \to \pi_i(Y,A) \to 1$, where $A$ is an abelian group and $Y$ is a topological space.

The long exact sequences of homotopy groups that arise from the splittings of the Thom spectra can be used to define various topological invariants of $X$, such as the Euler class, the Betti numbers, and the Hurewicz group.

Bulbul, et al. aims to address the impact of baryonic feedback on the cosmic shear power spectrum, which is a key tool for studying the large-scale structure of the universe. The authors use simulations to generate a mock data set for the cosmic shear power spectrum and its covariance matrix, which are then corrected for baryonic effects using the baryonification method of Schneider et al. (2019). They also develop an emulator to quickly predict the baryonic power suppression, allowing them to perform a likelihood analysis for a standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with both cosmological and astrophysical parameters.

The paper starts by discussing the importance of baryonic feedback in the universe, particularly in the context of cosmic shear surveys. The authors explain that baryonic feedback can lead to a suppression of the cosmic shear power spectrum on small scales, which can have a significant impact on the accuracy of weak lensing surveys. They note that current weak lensing surveys are limited by the poorly constrained shape and amplitude of this suppression, which can lead to uncertainties in the derived cosmological parameters."

However, helicity selection rules for diboson scattering amplitudes impose an obstruction to naïve interference contributions from dimension-six operators, resulting in the leading contribution to the total diboson rate correction cancelling. In this case, measuring the azimuthal decay angles 'resurrects' the interference, recouping sensitivity to the 'non-interfering' operators. We explore these signatures in detail and find that the EFT uncertainties associated with higher-dimensional operators are uniquely well-suppressed by the construction of an asymmetry variable generated exclusively by these non-interfering operators, relegating the effects of higher-dimensional, interfering operators to the same status as statistical errors in this observable."

Here, we demonstrate superfluidity in an ultracold 2D fermi gas by moving a periodic potential through the system and observing no dissipation below a critical velocity v$_{\rm c}$. We measure v$_{\rm c}$ as a function of interaction strength and find a maximum in the crossover regime between bosonic and fermionic superfluidity.

This approach has been used in a variety of applications. One of the key advantages of this method is that it allows for grading the voltage drop across high voltage insulators, which can increase the maximum operational voltage that can be applied across the insulator without the risk of surface flashover. However, a concern with this method is the long-term stability of the implantation-induced conductivity, particularly if the implanted metal species readily oxidizes. In this study, we investigate the long-term behavior of the surface conductivity of titanium-implanted alumina.

The proposed current is called the ""baryon current"" and is related to the Skyrme charge, but with a different value. The current is defined as equivalent to the Skyrme charge for any smooth configuration, but with a different value in the presence of the new symmetry.

The proposal is based on the idea that the baryon current can be expressed as a linear combination of the vector mesons and the chern-simons fields. The chern-simons fields are the vector fields that are dual to the gluons, and the vector mesons are the meson fields that are charged under the new symmetry. The baryon current is proposed to be a linear combination of these fields, with a coefficient that is determined by the new symmetry.

The proposal gives a unified picture for the two types of baryons, which are the proton and the neutron, and allows them to continuously transform into each other in a natural way. The baryon current is proposed to be the effective current for the baryons at low energies, and it is expected to be a good approximation for the full theory at high energies as well.

(laughter) I was a self-employed living statue called the eight-foot bride, and I love telling people I did this for a job, because everybody always wants to know, who are these freaks in real life. (laughter) I painted myself white one day, stood on a box, put a hat or a can at my feet, and when someone came by and dropped in money, I handed them a flower—and some intense eye contact. And if they didn't take the flower, I threw in a gesture of sadness and longing—as they walked away."
269,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"On October 4, 1957, the world witnessed a historic moment as the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the first man-made satellite, into space. This small metal ball, measuring less than two feet in diameter, ignited a space race between the United States and the Soviet Union that would last for eighteen years and reshape the global landscape. Sputnik was not the first human-made technology to reach space, however. That distinction belongs to the V-2 rocket, used by Germany in futile attempts to attack Allied cities during the final years of World War II. Although the V-2 rocket was not particularly effective, both the United States and the Soviet Union seized the technology and scientists behind it after the war and integrated them into their own space programs."

I am also an voracious reader, devouring literature from a wide range of authors, from Ian McEwan to Stephanie Meyer. I have read the Twilight tetralogy and enjoy nothing more than immersing myself in a good book or binge-watching my favorite TV shows on my home theater.

The climate emergency is the defining challenge of our time, and we are in a race against time to avert the worst impacts of global heating. A growing tide of impatience is building, particularly among young people, over the lack of global action. It is imperative that we step up our efforts to achieve a carbon-neutral world by 2050. I am pleased to see the launch of TED Countdown, as your influence and ideas can help accelerate momentum towards this critical goal. We have the tools, science, and resources at our disposal. Now, let us muster the political will and energy to overcome this challenge and secure a sustainable future for all."

Menstruation, a biological process that is essential for life, has been shrouded in secrecy and shame for centuries. Despite the fact that over 800 million women worldwide experience it every month, it remains a taboo topic in many cultures. As I speak to you now, women around the world are silently enduring the physical and emotional challenges of menstruation, hiding their sanitary products in brown paper bags and rushing to the bathroom to deal with the pain and discomfort in private.

The stigma surrounding menstruation has a profound impact on women's lives. It can make it difficult to discuss openly and honestly about their periods, leading to feelings of isolation and embarrassment. The shame and secrecy surrounding menstruation can also lead to a lack of understanding and support for women's reproductive health, perpetuating harmful attitudes and practices.

As someone who has experienced menstruation firsthand, I can attest to the exhaustion and discomfort that it can cause. The physical symptoms of menstruation, such as cramps and bloating, can be debilitating, and the emot"

The world's largest and most devastating environmental and industrial project is situated in the heart of the largest and most intact forest in the world, Canada's Boreal Forest. It stretches across northern Canada, home to the largest remaining wild caribou herd in the world, the George River Caribou Herd, numbering approximately 400,000 animals. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any of them during my visit, but you have their antlers as proof. Across the Boreal, we are blessed with this incredible abundance of wetlands. Wetlands are one of the most endangered ecosystems globally, providing critical ecological services such as cleaning the air, cleaning water, sequestering large amounts of greenhouse gases, and housing a vast array of species."

Roosevelt slept among the towering sequoia groves, braved a snowstorm, and spent countless hours engaging in spirited conversations around the campfire with his host and guide, the renowned conservationist John Muir. Roosevelt, an ardent lover of nature, was invited by Muir for more than just a camping trip - Yosemite was in peril. Although the valley was protected land since 1864, it remained vulnerable to overdevelopment in 1903, at the center of a decades-old struggle to strike a balance between preservation and public use. The contentious battle over Yosemite began in 1849 with the Gold Rush, as miners flocked west in search of gold in the Sierra Nevada foothills."

Unfortunately, I live in Gaza, and there is no airport. All borders are closed on every side. We live in one of the biggest prisons in the world. The only thing I can do is just look up to the sky.

285,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"The thought experiment proposed by philosopher Robert Nozick, known as the ""Experience Machine,"" raises thought-provoking questions about the nature of happiness and the value of life. The idea is to imagine a world where scientists have created a machine that can simulate real life experiences while eliminating all forms of pain and discomfort. If given the chance, would you choose to sign up for such an existence?
The prospect of living a life of unending pleasure and happiness is undoubtedly appealing, but it also raises several concerns. Here are some of the arguments for and against the idea of living in a world where one's experiences are simulated:Arguments For:1. Pain-free existence: The most obvious benefit of the experience machine is that it would eliminate all forms of pain and suffering. No more physical or emotional pain, no more loss, no more sadness, no more disappointment. Life would be a constant state of pleasure and contentment.2. Endless experiences: With the ability to simulate any experience, the experience machine would allow for an endless array of new experiences. You could live a lifetime of adventure, exploration, and personal growth without ever having to worry about the negative consequences.3. Immortality: The experience machine would effectively grant immortality. As long as the machine is functioning,"

Ten years ago, I made the decision to pursue a nursing degree, recognizing that the next major threat facing not only my city, but other cities across the country, was not the one-and-done disaster, where firefighters can simply ride in, put out the fire, and leave, feeling like they have made a difference and everything is okay."
288,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"Where does all the carbon we release go? Carbon is a natural part of the Earth's cycle, present in all living things, from the soil to the oceans and deep beneath the ground. When plants and other living things die, much of their stored carbon is released back into the atmosphere, but some of it becomes trapped in rock and sediment. Over millions of years, this trapped carbon is transformed into fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas. Natural events like volcanic eruptions also release some of the carbon trapped in rock. In addition, human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, release a significant amount of prehistoric carbon into the atmosphere each year, with humans releasing around 60 times more carbon than all the volcanoes on Earth combined."

However, a closer examination reveals a remarkable parallel between natural and human technologies: robustness. Robust systems are capable of functioning with remarkable resilience in unfamiliar and challenging environments. Intriguingly, cockroaches have been found to exhibit remarkable self-stabilization abilities when navigating rough terrain, even when equipped with a jet pack or subjected to perturbations such as earthquakes. Their exquisitely tuned limbs enable them to maintain equilibrium without expending any cognitive effort, allowing them to seamlessly traverse complex terrain, including grass, without any difficulty. In fact, we have discovered a novel behavior where, due to their unique body shape, they instinctively roll onto their sides to negotiate even the most challenging terrain. The remarkable versatility of robust systems extends beyond their ability to perform multiple tasks with the same structure. In essence, they are capable of adapting to new situations with remarkable ease, revealing a level of ingenuity that is both fascinating and inspiring."

And so, I would like to lift your spirits with one of the remarkable, yet little-known, commercial success stories of the past two decades. Comparable, in its own unique way, to the accomplishments of Microsoft or Google. And it has weathered the current recession with remarkable resilience. I refer, of course, to the organized crime industry.

Organized crime has been around for a long time, I know, and these words of caution are well-founded. But over the past two decades, it has experienced an unprecedented expansion, now accounting for roughly 15 percent of the world's GDP. I prefer to refer to it as the global shadow economy, or McMafia, for short.

So, what triggered this extraordinary growth in cross-border criminal activity?"

But what got me from there to here wasn't the punishment I faced as a teenager in adult prison or the harshness of our legal system. Instead, it was a learning environment of a classroom that introduced me to something I didn't think was possible for me or our justice system as a whole.

""We need to build a weather service for water. However, until we collectively demand accountability, the incentives to fund it will not exist. The first time I spoke at a TED conference was eight years ago, fresh out of grad school. Little did I know that in those few minutes on stage, I was framing the questions I would be asked for the next decade. And, like many 20-somethings, I expected to solve the world's water problems—more specifically, the world's water quality problems—with my technology. I had a lot to learn. It was seductive to believe that our biggest water quality problems persist because they're so hard to identify. And I presumed that we just needed simpler, faster, and more affordable sensors. I was wrong."
296,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"As the subprime crisis unfolded in 2007, I was struck by how little I knew about the financial system and how unprepared I was to face a major economic shock. I had always been content to trust that the system would take care of itself, that the economy would always grow and that my job was secure. But as the crisis deepened, I realized that I had been living in a state of denial. I had a fair few stormy conversations with my wife about the matter, about the limits of the model, about my job, and on the limits of the system. Besides the crisis, I realized that I was completely wrong, that we were heading for disaster.

The experience was a wake-up call for me, a realization that I had been living in a bubble, that my understanding of the economy was limited and that I had been relying on a model that was fundamentally flawed. It was a humbling experience, one that made me realize the importance of understanding the underlying mechanics of the economy and the interconnectedness of the global financial system. It also made me more aware of the fragility of the system and the potential for future crises."

The other thing to consider is the immense honor it is, as a politician, to give a TED Talk, particularly in the UK, where the reputation of politics has taken a hit due to the expenses scandal. In fact, there was even a recent story that scientists had thought about replacing rats in their experiments with politicians. When asked why, they replied, 'Well, there's no shortage of politicians, and no one really minds what happens to them. After all, there are some things that rats just won't do.'
