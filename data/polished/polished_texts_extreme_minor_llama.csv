1,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,blog,"Another week flew by me. I drove by the new house yesterday and the front window was covered in boxes. We may get the keys at closing, I am getting so excited. If everything goes well this week, we will be set for closing a week from Wednesday. I was up until after 3 00 am last night watching movies with Bethany. There has been a lot of movie watching going on around here lately. Here's my rundown  last night we watched thirteen, a movie every mother of a teenager should see. It was better than I expected. Then we watched Gigli, yes, it was just as bad as the media said it was, but we had to see for ourselves."
2,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,blog,"Summer TV used to be a dead zone filled with repeats, but now there are two great new shows I've been watching religiously for the past week. The most absurd concept I've come across recently is a hairstylist, Jonathan Antin, planning to open a second location for his extremely popular West Hollywood salon in Beverly Hills. Normally, I wouldn't care, but while flipping through channels, I caught a glimpse of Jonathan, looking equally narcissistic and dull, speaking in a public voice on Rodeo Drive, 'I'm going to build here the greatest salon in the history of the world!' - and I was hooked. Not since Rocco have I found someone as captivatingly clueless on TV."
3,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,blog,"What a week has been a challenging one for me. My right shoulder has tendonitis, located under my shoulder blade. As a result, when I move my arm excessively, especially when using a mouse on a computer, it becomes excruciatingly painful. I've been on a marathon of updates to my website and working on other online projects, which has left me with limited mobility. I'm struggling to muster the strength to draw or perform any physical activity. The lack of sleep is exacerbating my discomfort. I'm not feeling particularly thrilled at the moment, but I'm confident that I'll make a full recovery. My mom's surgery went well, and her eyesight has shown some improvement. She can now distinguish between fuzzy shapes and identify basic colors. While she still faces challenges, I'm hopeful that she'll regain her full vision soon."
4,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,blog,"I recently attempted to do laundry with the kids in tow and was struck by how quickly the simplest tasks can become a daunting ordeal. I also discovered how remarkably sweet total strangers can be, simply because they feel like being kind. Trust me, it wasn't as if they were trying to gain anything from me. I had a child's drool all over me and was wearing my 'wash-day' outfit. Additionally, I'm not sure I'll ever be bathing again, so there wasn't an olfactory incentive there! I'm doing two things simultaneously. I'm composing this post and watching collected notes from videos. I'm doing both of these tasks at my desk in my room."
5,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,blog,"It's 11 14 pm MST, and I'm currently in my bedroom fixing the personal computer of my job's personnel director. While I don't mind doing it, I sometimes wonder how often I find myself fixing someone else's computer out of obligation. I'm glad to be able to serve and support people in this way, but I often ponder where the line is drawn where it becomes exploitative. Over the past couple of weeks, I've been staying up late reading and such, so I was looking forward to an early bedtime, until I realized it would be more practical to return the computer to its owner. *chuckle* No rest for the weary, indeed. As I settled in, I found myself watching Joe Schmo 2 again tonight."
6,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,blog,"Remind me, what did I write about before this? Or, a continuation in the 'Is This a Date?' saga, so after the weird lunch, my confidence shook, I forgot to tell you guys an important piece of the story. Before Pat shows up to lunch, Duston starts talking about what a nice guy Pat is and how he's trying to find a girlfriend for him. I'm listening and nodding and realizing that we're talking more about finding Duston's best friend a girl than discussing whatever it is you discuss with a stranger over pink lemonade. I excused myself to the bathroom, looked in the mirror, and then silently asked myself  Am I being pawned off to the other guy? Is this what happens now?"
7,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,blog,"I would like everyone to take a moment to think before acting. In fact, I'd like each and every person in the world to pause before getting out of bed in the morning, and make a commitment to think critically all day. If they're not prepared to do so, I'd like them to consider going back to bed and taking a more thoughtful approach. I'm tired of people who act impulsively. Not being the most intelligent person, I believe it's reasonable to call out the absurdity of some situations. Let's focus on a few specific examples for now, and save others for another time, sound good?"
8,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,blog,"Two issues with the scenario outlined in my previous post  1. While the Bush administration's stimulus efforts are stimulating the economy, they are doing so in the wrong way. According to Robert Rubin, who spoke on NPR, the same stimulus effect could have been achieved without the long-term debt hangover by enacting targeted tax cuts, temporary tax cuts that would benefit low- and middle-income individuals. Ah, Robert Rubin, a name that resonates well with us. Quickly, can you name a Bush administration cabinet official with Rubin's gravitas? Still thinking... it will come to you... 2. We cannot hand over control to the Republicans solely during wartime, as they have cleverly crafted an endless, global 'war on terrorism.'"

Went to the cove to see Supernova; they were good as usual, got to chill with Tiago. Sat. Went to work and then out with Joe and Rach, met up with Steve, Tiago, and Tom. Came home around quarter to 12 and woke up the next morning at quarter to 7 for a meet. Got there a little late, but it's all good; I did my full-on floor and didn't fall, second on floor and vault, and third on beam, with a score of 29.45, which isn't bad because my meets get better as the season goes on."
10,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,blog,"Do you ever have those moments when you begin to reflect on life? Like, sitting in math class, feeling utterly bored, and wondering what exactly goes on in your brain that makes you understand math? And you realize that you exist and you're in math class, and you wonder why. Then you suddenly realize how amazing existing is. And it hits you - the fact that you're going on this random train of thought is incredibly pathetic. Ever had that happen? I hate that. You know what else I hate? Block schedules. Who would ever come up with that idea? Anyone can see that sitting through a two-and-a-half-hour class in any subject is cruel and an unusual punishment."
11,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,blog,"I think that monopoly has run its course in my life, and I vow to never lay my hands on that iron again. Tonight, Andy beat me by a few small dollars and won the farqu game, or maybe I let him win because he left in a few short hours and I wanted him to feel good on his last night here. Well, however the story goes, it can't compare to this Texas-sized headache I have at the moment. I've taken some Aleve and I must say that they're doing the trick. All I need now is some well-deserved R&R. Your telephone's the one that helped me wrap the cord around your neck... at the drive-in."
12,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,blog,"Well, today has been a long day. We drove home from Indiana. I suppose I'll have to be selective about what I write about, as I could take up a lot of time and space and I just don't have the energy. First, I have to say that camp was amazing and even better than I could have expected. God has been doing so much in my life lately, and it's just amazing. I've sort of turned over a new leaf, I guess, but anyway, back to the beginning. We arrived at the Twiggs' house on Friday evening and stayed until we left for camp on Monday. Most of what we did was visit the fair, attend church, watch the parade, shop at Walmart, and watch movies."
13,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,blog,"Today is my last day of summer vacation! And, I have a dentist appointment at 9. I'm not thrilled about it, but I'd rather get it over with than try to schedule it during the first month of my surgery rotation. I'm feeling nervous, scared, and jittery - I'm definitely not looking forward to it. This is going to be a whole new experience for me. As a perfectionist, I strive to excel at everything I do. However, starting new things can be challenging. I dislike being a pawn, and I dislike not knowing what's going on."
14,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,blog,"Arun Shourie discusses how, as far back as 1996, the then-governor of Uttar Pradesh warned about the impending threat of the rise of a 'third Islamic state' in the subcontinent. T.V. Rajeswar, the former head of the Intelligence Bureau and the current governor of Uttar Pradesh, had predicted this dire threat in a series of articles published in the Hindustan Times. Shourie raises a valid point when he asks, does the fact that it was Rajeswar, not I, and certainly not Mr. Advani, who wrote these warnings make them more credible? Or do you conclude that Rajeswar's repeated warnings make him a closet communalist and therefore unfit to continue as governor of Uttar Pradesh?"
15,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,blog,"Attitude  indifferent, mood  looking forward to tonight, after a long, hard day in the trenches here today, folks, I'm afraid I barely have time to write anything for you readers. However, it's great to see Tiger taking up the reins herself and making an appearance, discussing things. Not much to say about yesterday, but I did enjoy Shakespeare on the green, a lovely play, although I had to leave before the curtain closed, which was a bit of a letdown. Hopefully, I'll get to see the entirety of a Shakespeare play someday. By the way, Akcron is right about the problems with the shower – it's not ideal, I admit, the look people get when committing self-torture can be quite entertaining."
16,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,blog,"All of a sudden, for the past two days, I have been overcome with terrible bouts of exhaustion. I'm feeling bone-deeply fatigued. Last evening, I went home and just slept off, and only got up when my mother called me around 8 30. And when I woke up, it was all dark, and I hadn't switched the lights on, so I couldn't figure out what time or date it was, for a few seconds, it was just my mother's voice in the darkness and me grappling with reality. I wonder why I'm feeling so drained... The weather outside is quite pleasant this morning. It was drizzling when I arrived, and I'm told it's been raining for the past three days in Calcutta."
17,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,blog,"Last night was the worst. I threw away the sweater I was knitting, which had only about 14 inches to its completion. I lost around $10 worth of yarn, as it's $8 per skein. However, it had too many stitches by the time I got to the armholes, and the mohair was knotting itself together as I knitted, so frogging (ripping out rows) didn't work well. The yarn broke a lot. I didn't even swear, which is unusual for me. I simply ripped and listened to the second season of Sex and the City (a great show, library!). Then, I got tired of it and threw it away. I suppose I could say I learned a lot while trying to make this sweater."
18,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,blog,"Last night in class, we discussed the assigned reading for the week, 'Toward a Renewed Study of the Place-World' by Edward S. Casey. The first chapter explores ""implacement"" and the second, ""displacement."" In the first chapter, Casey makes a distinction that our contemporary world and culture revolve around time as the situating force  we are running out of time, we have saved time, and we are just in time. He argues that using place as the center of culture provides a more grounded community. (Please note that this is a rough summary, and I offer it with a disclaimer, just in case my professor or any classmate happens to read this post.) So far, this book is the first reading that has truly captured my attention."
19,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,blog,"There should be some warning  making pops with unusual colors could make life a bit peculiar. While giggling is enjoyable, one wonders if we would have found ourselves escaping the fire, drinking beer in the fierce wind, had we not been eating them earlier. Finding ourselves in a doorway to a bar, sadly closed for business, we stopped to examine an office-supplies catalogue that had arrived in the post. Luckily, we did. Who could have guessed that within these pages were the special offers of a lifetime? Not I, for certain. I list but a few  buy 36 permanent marker pens, get a stunt kite. Buy 30 lever arch files, get a barbecue."
20,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,blog,"Currently listening to 'The Little Drummer Boy' by Stevan Pasero...and now, my post... Senate Republicans, hands up - who watched the 39-hour judicial nomination marathon last week? I know I didn't. Well, I did tune in once or twice. The entire colossal waste of time was orchestrated by Republicans who, frustrated that Democrats wouldn't roll over and nominate four of Bush's controversial justices, were trying to score political points by holding a multi-day spectacle. Never mind the fact that Democrats have already approved 168 of Bush's judicial nominees - no, that's not good enough for the power-hungry Republicans who are for some reason laboring under the misapprehension that they have a huge mandate for this kind of nonsense."
21,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,blog,"This was a good weekend. I devoted a lot of time to reading, after a long hiatus, and listened to a lot of music (something I should have started doing much earlier). I finished three books over the weekend  Bruce Sterling's Heavy Weather, Larry Niven's World of Ptavvs, and Octavia Butler's Parable of the Sower. Heavy Weather was a good cyberpunk romp through a near-future USA, devastated by global warming and general anarchy. While it was clever, well-paced, and altogether very convincing, I must confess that I failed to come away with any really significant sensations about the story or the characters. Not that both aren't well constructed and vividly etched - it's a good book, but not a great one, I suppose."
22,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,blog,"The aftermath of the first week back from practicum was a struggle, but it wasn't until the second week that the smoke began to clear. Post-practicum trauma was a hidden epidemic that's only now coming to light. I was struck, but the eventual meeting with the course coordinator allowed me to release my burden, and by doing so, I prevented another person from being stuck with a pedagogically deficient practicum school. Yesterday, on Monday, I ran into another agrieved classmate who was determined to go to the student who was due to go to her school in the next practicum and warn him about how terrible it would be. I calmed her down and suggested that we should approach the administrator first."
23,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,blog,"Well, things have been incredibly busy here at times, but there's always time for stress-relieving activities. I've found that I really struggle with 8-ball and ping pong! Rick, also known as the Canuck, consistently beats me on a regular basis - we have a ping pong table in the front lobby of our building, always available for a quick round. Last night, I participated in an 8-ball tournament at the hot spot, our recreation tent, which is equipped with a popcorn machine, numerous TVs, jukebox, DVD rental, pool table, dart board, and ever-present ping pong table. I did fairly well throughout my one entire game, until I scratched on the eight ball. Despite this, I still had a great time - the most fun was the two Dutch soldiers who joined in the tournament."
24,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,blog,"Fall 1974  I struggled to make my way through the second chapter of my high school algebra book for what felt like the 13th time. I'm not a math person; I hate math, and I'm math-phobic. You get the picture. As I struggled to make sense of algebra, the doorbell rang. I put down my book and went to answer it. No one was there. Great. I returned to my studies, and just as I was finding a glimmer of understanding, the doorbell rang again. Suddenly, my breakthrough disappeared. I went to the door and once again, no one was there. Just what a struggling math student needs, an uninvited practical joker."
25,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,blog,"This past week has been nothing short of exhausting. I spent Tuesday to Thursday finishing the move to my new classroom. The new room is bigger and closer to my grade-level team, which are the things I need to consider as I spend hours upon hours preparing my room for this year. Had I known I was going to move prior to the end of my school year, I would have discarded much of the books and supplies I no longer use. Unfortunately, it all came with me. So this week was spent moving, unpacking, and purging profusely. I have to thank my teammate Jill for helping with all of this. You see, she was still teaching this month in my old room. So she and her lovely students moved almost my entire room for me!"

Even if I never had the privilege of being a parent to you, even if I was never formally married to you, even if I was never an official partner to you... I loved you immensely, and to this day, the feeling carries an echo through my heart. Forever, I will always be reminded of the few precious nights we spent together, our hearts and limbs entwined in a soulful embrace, bathed in the salty darkness of an evening by the beach... or a kiss under the rain. Whenever I feel the sensation of a dark glass piercing my heart, you will be there. That piece of you... the eternal love that once lived in me... and still lingers. For her."

Or, I'd rather rephrase it, the article I'm working on and its consequences isn't exactly something I'm entirely comfortable with. Perhaps it's because I don't fully believe in it, so I can't quite get the complete feel for it. The underlying passion behind it. The full-out commitment to it, though, is what I question. I've grown up in a country where you don't ask questions. In fact, you simply don't. They would silence you for that. They'd put you in jail with all these internal security measures. I'm not accustomed to this freedom of speech...not used to speaking out loud. While I'm not the easiest person to get along with."
28,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,blog,"We had an outing yesterday with my colleagues from the bank. We visited Guintubdan, La Carlota, a destination that was new to most of us. We embarked on a 30-minute trek to reach the falls, and it was a challenging but rewarding experience. As we caught our breath, we exclaimed, ""Whew!"" But we persevered and made it to the site. The water was refreshingly chilly, and the coldness was palpable, making our bodies feel numb. We stayed for less than an hour before moving on to the nearby waterfalls, another 30-minute trek. However, the trip was well worth the effort, as the falls were calming, and the scenery was breathtaking. It was as if we were one with nature, and soaking in the cold water was a form of communion with the earth. The cold air and water lulled us into a state of serenity, making us feel like we were on the verge of sleep."

It's the one thing I didn't get from the Buenviajes, the want to drink. There are few times I don't mind drinking, but let's just say they are very rare times. So, we have a month left before Ed leaves. I think it's starting to sink in with Ed and all of us. I think it sank in with me a long time ago. I just hope that Ed will be here for Bailey's surgery. We've been keeping an eye on his swelling, and there definitely is quite a bit of swelling."

Thank goodness I brought a bag of eggs with me just in case. So Connor had a great time finding eggs out in the park. Sunday morning, when he woke up, he was so excited that the Easter bunny had come. There's nothing better than seeing the excitement on your child's face. After egg hunting, we all went to church. Even though the Easter bunny is fun and all, we do make sure our kids know the true meaning of the holidays. This was Megan's first Easter, and she looked so cute in her jean dress and stockings."

I somehow managed to get a flat tire. Luckily, I'm at work, so the guys are going to inflate it for me and ensure it holds air. If not, they'll change my tire and slap the spare on it.

When I go upstairs after arguing with Nicole about Kelli, like I just did a few minutes ago, and they want me to tell them what's wrong. Yeah, how about you just let me handle it?

So, I'm happy to be sitting here instead of still sitting in my car. Yesterday, Sarah decided to Google me, and lo and behold, the email I wrote to Ivar Meisel on ESPN.com was published online.

Don't think about it. I've just gotten back from an evening out at my old music teacher/friend's house. Yes, I know... I missed a few things, but I did tape it!

Nothing like 48 hours of daydreaming to get one's creative energy back. I have it good for a forgeiner, and my timing was good, too. The illustration part is the icing on the cake. I'd probably complain more if that didn't fall in my lap. I know I am getting ripped off, though. I'm not blind to that fact. Getting hungry.

As a non-American blogger, I've been a little reluctant to get involved in some of these discussions, particularly the bits about flags, but since I started it (the subject, not the flag-burning) I suppose I'd better say something. Firstly, I think that the idea of having a law against flag-burning is completely nonsensical. The moment you start according to a symbol - any symbol - that kind of automatic reverence and protection, you've taken a small but important step towards totalitarianism. Symbols are kind of fickle - they don't a priori represent anything in themselves; it's what they are perceived as meaning or made to represent that's important."

I'm too tired to delve into specifics, but I do think it had potential. However, I believe that too much energy was spent on the set, which was magnificent, and not enough on creating a solidifying tone, theme, etc. The story was retold, but it wasn't particularly gripping, and I don't feel like I gained anything from watching it. The character development was rather weak. Additionally, I thought the score was poor, and was essentially a knock-off of Gladiator. The Gladiator used the background music of a moaning woman, which worked because it backed up and complemented a genuinely gripping narrative."

From  John Yurkanin, Chief Operating Officer,

Re  Loss of continuity in PX day-ahead auction due to ISO rule changes, the emergency tariff filing by the California ISO last Friday has had a negative effect on the PX day-ahead auction market.

The mixture of soft and hard caps results in a complete disconnect and unacceptable risk to all of our participants, and will probably not provide the ISO with its sought-after reduction in real-time energy sales and procurement.

The overall effect will be that supply will still defer to the higher realized price opportunity the ISO offers.

Deal 418065 CGAS CityGate with TRCO and CGLF production pricing and TRCO, CGLF, and CGAS transport pricing (this will take a while to do). Do we want to turn the auto-confirms off?

96,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,game_review,"It puts the ball in the net or it gets the hose again. Absolutely amazing, having nothing negative to say about this game as it's exceeded my expectations and will probably exceed yours too. Fluid movement, bug-free, lots of story/content to put you through, options for each and every day such as multiple practices, events, and even games. This review is based on playing my career, and so far it's 10/10. Facescan worked really well for me (used it two times, first one made me have a down syndrome forehead though). Keep in mind, using the MyNBA2K17 app will allow for you to facescan for free and allow you to earn daily VC. #sellout"
97,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,game_review,"Magic fans beware  Wizards are hesitant to create a decent digital game. At its core, the gathering is a social game. A game to enjoy with friends (or frenemies) - laughing, talking smack, and dropping game-winning bombs. Wizards of the coast seem to have forgotten this. If you choose to play with friends, you can earn gold, and gold is crucial. Gold is so crucial that they have implemented a daily cap, considering gold unlocks everything in the game. But be prepared for a long and tedious 1v1 grind against the computer or random opponents, whom you can't even communicate with. If you choose to play for free, it will take you roughly four hours a day for upwards of a month, by yourself, to unlock the cards."
98,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,game_review,"As I tackle the third installment in the trilogy, I'll address the less pleasant aspects first. I strongly dislike pre-quals as they often hinder the story's progression, moving backwards rather than forwards. While it does provide more story depth, the combat feels somewhat sloppy and lacks the sharpness that Arkham City achieved. As of my writing this recommendation (October 26, 2013), a game-breaking bug persists, preventing a side mission from ever being completed (the main story remains unaffected). Some gadgets are inconveniently assigned to a hotkey, requiring a tedious keyboard journey to access them. Although this may seem minor, it could potentially disrupt combat combos during gameplay."
99,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,game_review,"They effectively fixed Shadow Warrior (2013), i.e., the boss fights are impressive, weapons feel very pleasant (perhaps not as excellent as D44m's ones, but still solid), enemies aren't overly spongy (if you're not too inept with handling elemental and upgrade items). The upgrade system is well-balanced and once you master it, it's not overly tedious. The elemental abilities and limited ammunition encourage you to use different weapons. Many unique (notably, the crucial aspect here while comparing Sw2 to Borderlands' formula of 'rng' weapons) weapons remain viable throughout most of the game. The music is excellent, particularly the main theme and, of course, Stan Bush's contributions."
100,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,game_review,"So many things went wrong. I'm not sure how to start this review, as it's related to my career. My player is an outside scorer, PG, 1.71m, with maxed stats and all necessary perks. Okay, and now I'd like to know, why the shooting skill depends on a person's height? Why a person who has 1.74m can't become as good in shooting as a person with 1.71m? I'm 1.87m in RL, made my first player with this height and noticed that I couldn't reach a higher skill than 89. Why is that a pure discrimination? And why the game doesn't inform me of this before I create a character and not even then when I reach the skill limit after weeks of playing?"
101,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,game_review,"I think the assassin's creed nailed the mechanics on all fronts, including ship battles, sailing, hunting, and parkour, etc. I felt more attached to this character as well. The story starts out rough but gets much better as you play. Edward was an interesting character, and so were all the side characters. I felt like all the collectibles actually meant something in this AC game, which I never got from any of the previous ones. Perhaps it's because I felt like they had a bigger purpose in the game. They weren't required, but they were fun to get and were rewarded in a very balanced way."
102,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,game_review,"While I personally cannot recommend this game, it wasn't absolutely terrible. The gunplay is alright, so long as you have the money to purchase gun parts, which would be my main complaint with this game: it's pay-to-win. If I could get past that, the game would be enjoyable, as the hard suit is fun to use and hardsuit is an excellent idea. I'd take this game over any Call of Duty title any day, but its pay-to-win microtransaction format is off-putting for me. If you're alright with this model, then by all means, have fun. But if you're like me and dislike pay-to-win games, just let this one slide; it's not our cup of tea."
103,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,game_review,"While not perfect, this game has been greatly enjoyable. The save system and possibility of sudden death lead to some frustration. I'm on my first playthrough, and I lost my main character around hour 10 of 20ish. I would have really liked a save option to reload at that point. I've since picked up a third-party mod/save tool to avoid catastrophic failures. Additionally, the aiming reticle is on the small side, and zoom is underpowered. With all that said, it's been a blast. I'm not normally a zombie fan, but the combination of strategy, missions, first-person shooter/beat-em-up is great. I've been playing it as often as I can get away... just one more mission, just one more supply run, or I'm running away and want to get safe before shutting the game down."
104,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,game_review,"This is an absolute great strategy game! Having played every single other war game (European Escalation and Albion), I have to say this one fits well. The number of units is great. Not sure exactly how many units there are, but there's a crap ton! Graphics are just beautiful, sounds are great, and the gameplay overall is epic. The in-game chat box at the main menu is very entertaining, no, I'm not kidding. However, if you think this game is 'easy', or if you're new to the strategy genre, it could take you quite some time to get it nailed down. Don't get upset, you will lose a lot of units. Just make sure you plan ahead, always have anti-air, and anti-tank."
105,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,game_review,"I was initially skeptical about this game before I played it. I wasn't even sure about purchasing it. The portal gun and portal aspect seemed unusual to me, even though I appreciate science fiction. Boy, I was wrong. The humor and voice acting in this game are phenomenal. They're not cheesy, except for a few instances. The various characters have their own unique sense of humor. Their distinct personalities really shine through. The level design is just fantastic. By the way, I never played the original Portal game. One of these days, I'm planning to play it if I can spare the time. I wouldn't have played it if I hadn't played the sequel."
107,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,game_review,"Yes, this is a nostalgic trip for thirty-somethings who remember (at least in the UK) watching the ever-irksome Timmy Mallet just for the five-minute Transformers cartoon. The voice actors for Optimus, Megatron, Bumblebee, and many others are back, and instantly recognizable. The distinctive cartoon transformation sound is there. Graphically, the cell-shaded presentation is perfect, and very, very Generation One. But aside from that, it's actually a very fun game. The combat mechanics are extremely well done. Transforming mid-fight is often a necessity, and seamlessly woven into combos, making it quite unlike High Moon's excellent War for/Energon games. Another distinction is the heavy focus on melee combat, but some enemies (e.g., Seekers) require a switch to a ranged blaster."
108,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,game_review,"I downloaded the game and played it for a bit, but it didn't impress me. The login process took more time than the actual gameplay. There's a minor bug that pops up a message about an update to the terms of service, but clicking 'accept' doesn't work and requires a client restart. I'm not thrilled about linking my Steam and GFace accounts, as it's unnecessary for DLC and not reversible. Now, I'm concerned that a company I don't care about has access to my Steam information. The game itself is unoriginal, being easily recognizable as a Call of Duty clone. They somehow managed to make the gunplay even worse, which is puzzling."
109,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,game_review,"4K+ at 60fps (GTX 970), dual audio options, and Neptune Gear included. What's not to love? https //www.youtube.com/watch?v=nygsb617tmo An excellent port, making it a great entry point for those new to the series. Keep in mind that there is some (skip-able) dialogue. As usual, I recommend using a gamepad, but I had no issues with a keyboard/mouse setup, both fully rebindable. The price is reasonable, and I wouldn't have been unhappy with a purchase. More than half the DLC is included for free, providing plenty to play with. I highly recommend this game to JRPG, anime, and visual novel fans, assuming you're comfortable with occasional long breaks between action sequences. Cheers.

110,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,game_review,"I experienced no performance issues even at release, and after all these patches, the game plays really well. In my opinion, this is a truly great and fun game in truth, although the format may be somewhat annoying (where the free-roam city area repopulates with new enemies every time you progress the story). I particularly enjoyed the 'dual play' segments (where you can play Batman + 1 more), and the ability to use the controller for most segments of the game, while using the mouse and keyboard for the tank combat segments was greatly appreciated. Driving your Batmobile around the free-roam city, including when chasing the APC commanders, is actually quite enjoyable once you figure out how to use the brakes to skid around corners (and when you master that, driving around the city is really quite enjoyable)."
111,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,game_review,"Fantastic FPS shooter - that's the bottom line. It looks, sounds, and plays great - excellent FPS mechanics, engaging story, well-developed characters, and a fantastic soundtrack. Not for the faint of heart, though - some cutscenes were quite intense and graphic. However, when a game is this great, it's easier to overlook the flaws, and here they are as I saw them  a lack of simultaneous support for multiple graphics cards. I had to put the game away until I upgraded my graphics card, as it ran poorly on my old dual-GPU GTX 590. Be sure to have a decent single-GPU card."
112,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,game_review,"English is not my native language, so I'll forgive any typing or grammatical mistakes in my review of this fantastic game. I'll break down this review into a few categories  graphics, controls, sound, and replayability. Graphics  the game features a comic-like style, with very slick graphics and nice color schemes. The graphics can be set on 'high' without straining your system. I run this game on an i5 Pentium processor with an Nvidia GeForce 710M card and 8GB of memory, and it runs smoothly (Windows 8.1). Controls  the game can be played with a keyboard and mouse, or with an Xbox controller."
113,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,game_review,"You can see the hours I've invested in this game, which indicates my enthusiasm for it. This is everything I wished a search game from Cod would be. However, I wouldn't recommend this game solely because it's like Cod, Battlefield, or any other shooter game. It's a game in its own class and should be treated as such. I've heard numerous times from new players who complain about getting killed quickly. Oh, the horror! It's not like that doesn't happen in real life, or anything. I've been playing this game for a while now, and I've thrown a significant amount of money at it. One of the best multiplayer games around. It's a great game to play when you're not feeling CS GO."
114,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,game_review,"I'm 2 hours in and I'm dying from laughter from this game. The gameplay is solid, the art design is beautiful, the music is surprisingly high-quality and fitting, the story/world has me intrigued, and the puzzles are fun. But the best thing about this game is the comedy. If you've played any RPG since the dawn of video game RPGs, you'll likely laugh at the various jokes, parodies, and references; if you've never played an RPG before, you'll still enjoy the game for its humor. If you played Final Fantasy 7 or X, you absolutely must play this game, without giving away too much... I had to stop playing after 2 hours to give my cheeks a break from laughing and smiling so much. What a delight so far."
115,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,game_review,"I'm really sorry, I try to be supportive of free-to-play games and indie developers, but I really didn't enjoy this game. The description sounded right up my alley, but the execution has done nothing for me. I love puzzle and exploration games, but I found this game to be completely unintuitive, and even after looking up how to progress, I still just simply didn't find the gameplay itself enjoyable. It also lacks a pause button, or if it does have one, I never found it. Considering that many sequences in the game are timed, this seems like a critical oversight. I also feel like this game is a lot more cutscene than it is game, and I end up just sitting around drumming my fingers a lot."
116,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,game_review,"This game was an absolute delight from start to finish. I was hooked from the story to the graphics. The narrative wasn't just a story, but I felt like I was that person, trying to figure out what came next in the story that my character was telling. Gameplay was excellent and I learned a lot about myself through this game (mainly my fear of heights, which I never had a problem with until the ice caverns). My gut churned the whole time, but I persisted for Uncle Fred! If you guys made a DLC or second game, I would be the first to buy it and recommend it to everyone I know. Thanks to everyone involved in making this, you created a truly beautiful game."
117,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,game_review,"Sid Meier's Civilization  Beyond Earth is a turn-based game where you build your civilization to a specific goal or 'victory'. In previous games, you were set on the Earth's timeline, progressing through periods like the Stone Age, Medieval Age, and Modern Age. In this game, you're set in the future on a mission to colonize a new planet. What I enjoy about this game is that it took a new approach to the game and introduced new mechanics such as the Affinity System and Orbital Layer. However, I didn't enjoy that the game could be overwhelming at times. I think that what could be improved is incorporating some new artwork in the game, such as the environment you experience when communicating with another leader."
118,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,game_review,"Great game! This zombie survival game offers tons of replayability and is extremely fun! It's one of the better, more realistic zombie games I've ever played. After playing over 60 hours, I can honestly say this is one of the more realistic zombie games. It's very much designed like a survival horror, where you must save up your ammo, heal your own wounds when you bleed out, take pills when you're infected, etc. I find the zombies to feel very natural to be well-animated for a free-to-play game. P.S.  I would recommend getting 1 or 2 friends to play with, as the community is super friendly and you can usually make friends/talk with the people in the chat or over voice comms."
119,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,game_review,"February 7, 2014 - Unfortunately, I cannot thoroughly recommend or enjoy this game due to the short time I've played it. I know I would be addicted if it didn't have the following two game-breaking issues. The lack of Australian servers puts you at a severe disadvantage, creating unbearable lag. Moreover, I played through the offline training mode and it was stuttering and lagging as well (it's astonishing that this happened). Additionally, the poor ping rate only adds to the frustration. Everything about the game is chaotic, from the menus to the backgrounds, training, and in-game assets. I've never experienced this issue with this card and initially thought it might not be compatible with my graphics card. Setting my GPU back to stock settings and, sure enough, it didn't make a difference."
120,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,game_review,"Last night, I finished this game. The story is not particularly deep or captivating, but the storytelling is what makes it stand out. The atmosphere is rich and immersive, and the many collectibles do an excellent job of fleshing it out. I learned a lot about the world of Batman, so it was a bit disappointing that there were so few boss battles. However, there are enough future games to rectify that. The combat is the right amount of challenge, leaning towards the easier side. Leveling up Batman wasn't very satisfying. It's the gadgets you acquire and upgrade during the campaign that add nice new gameplay mechanics. Having access to previously unreachable places makes for a sense of progression."
121,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,game_review,"'To the moon' is no mere game... Nay, it is a veritable experience, and it was one of the best of my life at that. Telltale's 'The Walking Dead' is sad? Hohoho! Well, it's no match for 'To the Moon!' Never before have I been so depressed yet fulfilled over something purely fictional. This masterpiece represents the pinnacle of storytelling in my opinion, and the soundtrack is a gorgeously charming and perfect accompaniment. Yes, the controls are a bit finicky, and the gameplay is not the strong point, but the story is so fantastic that I did not care one bit. Plus, the humor is great as well, and it definitely does not intrude upon the distinguished nature of the story... And the references are endless."
122,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,game_review,"Bastion is a brilliant game, with a truly great storyline. Following a calamity, you begin rebuilding on the bastion. The game offers a wide range of choices, including selecting what to build for an advantage, choosing weapons and power-ups for those weapons, as well as drinks to grant bonus effects. The game's art style and music are fantastic, making the apocalypse seem vibrant and engaging. Furthermore, the game features narration that adapts to the player's actions, so if you pick up a weapon and switch to another in the armory, the narration will acknowledge your change."
123,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,game_review,"I had initially acquired this game during its early development, when the primary currency was spacebux, and there was no 'tech tree' in place. At that time, the game was enjoyable. All the weapons were equally overpowered, so there were no issues with balance; anyone could kill anyone at any moment. Additionally, the game used to provide unlimited gun slots and five loadouts. You might expect that for a game with 'billions of guns', they would at least offer more than six weapon slots and three loadouts before requiring payment for additional options. At one point, I had about three pages' worth of weapons, and was conceptualizing new ideas for more, as I found that to be where I derived my enjoyment."
124,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,game_review,"This game was a delightful surprise. One often sees glowing reviews of certain products that are often misleading. In this case, the reviews reflect the fun of this charming little game. It's an intriguing blend of a classic 2D platformer and a MOBA, and it does it with flair. I found myself enjoying characters that I wouldn't normally appreciate in other MOBA games. I had expected this trait to continue, but decided to give a melee tank a try anyway. I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome and ended up trying out more as they were unlocked from playing games. The art style and interface are delightfully charming. As such, I now use one of the characters as my avatar and a wallpaper from creating a card set for the game."
125,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,game_review,"I just started playing, and I'm absolutely enthralled by this game. I put on my headphones and lose myself in the game for hours at a time. It's been a while since a game has had this level of engagement with me. The music perfectly sets the mood, the sound effects are spot on, and the controls are seamless. I look forward to every combat, and they've executed combat extremely well. I had some initial reservations about the naval combat system, but it's actually a lot of fun to lay waste to multiple fleets at once! The only way to lose in this game is to fail to retreat. If the combat appears overwhelming, just get out of there, regroup, and counter-attack. Thanks, developers, for an exceptional experience!"
126,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,game_review,"The reboot of the Devil May Cry franchise has brought about many changes for the series, particularly for its protagonist, Dante. While fans of the original series may be upset at the change to their beloved character, it's certainly for the better; and this new game by Ninja Theory proves it. The game serves as the perfect point for newcomers to jump into the series. It shows the origins of an arrogant, cynical Dante, and it chronicles his journey from cynicism to selflessness. Throughout, the game weaves a clear, narrative arc for the new Dante, making him a compelling character to watch. The story follows Dante as he's introduced into the corrupt world he willfully chose to ignore."
127,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,game_review,"Where do I start on this absolutely beautiful game? Its story is absolutely charming. It has so much detail put into it, and it's a bundle of happiness, bad puns, annoying dogs, and secrets. It's serious when it needs to be, but isn't a stranger to funny moments. The character design is on point, with various characters having distinct personalities and secrets. It stands out from other RPGs because you don't have to kill anyone, which is an unused concept in RPGs. With lots of inspiration from Earthbound, one of the best RPGs I've seen, you can tell it's going to be good. It easily has the best soundtrack I've heard in a while."
128,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,game_review,"I'm recommending this solely because it's free and may provide a more enjoyable experience for others. As for my experience, the game didn't leave a lasting impression on me. Half the story relies on shock value. I wasn't shocked or emotionally moved in any way by this. Perhaps I'm desensitized, or maybe it was too simplistic to elicit a reaction from me. As for the other half of the game, it attempts to paint a vivid picture of a person's mental decline. It explores themes of obsession, hallucinations, depression, and a few other issues. In theory, it's an intriguing concept. However, the game took me 10 minutes to complete, which is reasonable considering the amount of information presented."
129,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,game_review,"Do I even need to explain why Portal is amazing? Portal is a puzzle game that presents a concept and then gets out. It's an amazing way to challenge your mind while still being enjoyable. Although this game isn't as story-driven, it did give birth to one of the most popular games of 2011. I still play this game and enjoy returning to it when I'm feeling bored and love to revisit what gave rise to a legend and what is a legend. Gameplay  Portal's gameplay is relatively straightforward, to explain at least. You utilize portals to your advantage, along with buttons that activate a portion of the puzzle. Two buttons are present in the game, one that you press and one that requires a cube to place."
130,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,game_review,"If you can overlook the minor bugs (which I personally experienced only two  one minor and the other quite annoying), the edit  both bugs are resolved, and my FPS increased from 60-90 to 80-120. If you're looking for a space exploration game, I can definitely recommend this. Since most of these reviews are about specs, I'll include mine  i5 6600k (~200€) Radeon RX 480 (~200€) Z170 Pro - Gaming (~150€) 16GB DDR4 RAM (~70€) ~650€ is definitely within the medium price range, although this rig is quite new. Almost constant 60+ FPS on high settings with vsync enabled, I genuinely can't believe 90% of the comments saying they're rocking an overkill setup and getting 20 FPS."
131,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,game_review,"Remember the age of mythology? Yes, it's been a while since there's been an RTS game of such quality. Divinity  Dragon Commander comes close to these borders of my personal most favorite RTS game. Combine this with a huge risk-like grand strategy mode, and it hits the spot. I'm not (read  try not to be) overly biased due to the fact that this game allows you to turn into a dragon, aiding your troops by supporting, attacking, and even commanding unit production, direction, and spawning at the very same time. Honestly, I do like the complex RTS games nowadays. Think of Civilization V and so on. However, such games attempt to cram complex mechanics, charts, and resources all into one complicated game mode."
132,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,game_review,"Undertale comes together to create something greater than the sum of its parts. The retro aesthetic of the graphics and the music combine to produce truly beautiful and impactful moments. The script masterfully runs the gamut from comedy to drama to heartbreak and even hope, often simultaneously, and achieves this by subverting RPG tropes with ease. Without delving into the world, characters, story, or gameplay mechanics, I could wax poetic about its many virtues. Instead, I'll simply say this  if you're a fan of RPGs, play this game. If you're a gamer, play this game. If you have seven free hours between now and your mortality, play this game."
134,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,game_review,"I have had this game for a few months, but in just that short period, two DLCs have emerged, along with patches that have transformed an already excellent game into an exceptional one. The developers are very active in the community, and it's evident in the various discussion forums and dev diaries. Although the game's mechanics have a fairly steep learning curve, this breadth of strategy offers a myriad of ways to achieve goals and capitalize on specific situations. In my opinion, the game is almost infinitely replayable. I find myself fully immersed in every session I play, regardless of how the playthrough is going."
135,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,game_review,"Warframe is a fun game for the initial hours of play. As you progress beyond those few enjoyable hours, you'll notice that the game's offerings begin to dwindle, with repetition dominating its combat, enemies, and gameplay. The redeeming quality is that the developers are actively working to deliver regular updates, which often bring significant changes to the game's systems, new Warframes, and other enhancements. It's an excellent choice for casual play. While I'm skeptical about its long-term appeal, I recommend giving it a try. If you're seeking a quick fix, Warframe is worth a try. Since it's free, there's no harm in giving it a shot."
136,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,game_review,"This game is quite underwhelming. I purchased this game thinking it was a PC version of 'Katamari Damacy', a popular and enjoyable PS2 game. Unfortunately, it's a far cry from it. In this game, you progress by absorbing increasingly larger objects to grow bigger and absorb bigger entities. However, the gameplay isn't as smooth as it could be, the levels lack inventiveness, and the content is a surreal, unsettling horror experience. I don't mean an entertaining horror experience, but one that leaves you questioning the meaning of life. Every 'living' creature in this game, from small pets to human beings, makes me wonder if the creators of this game had an interest in taxidermy."
137,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,game_review,"Alright, let me explain a few things. As someone deeply interested in politics, I was very interested in this game when I first heard about it. I thought, 'Oh wow, a simulator of the road to becoming president! That sounds fun!' However, it wasn't as exciting as I had hoped. The game starts you off and asks you to pick a side  Republican or Democrat, with no independent or third-party option. A bit disappointed, but still optimistic, I decided to see what I could do. I'll give the game credit, the character customization, although limited, is pretty fun to play around with. It's the only time it's an option to wear your head or not in a campaign. Literally."
138,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,game_review,"The Fallout 3 story is better. Settlements often get in the way of the story, making it difficult to play the story. Some keys are hardcoded and cannot be rebound. Bugs abound. My Pip-Boy disappeared permanently at one point and I had to research console commands to get it back. You don't have to work for power armor, as it's basically given to you from the beginning of the game and power cores are readily available in trader shops. The value of power armor has diminished greatly from previous Fallout games. The story is mediocre, and everything about this game is average, except it doesn't crash every 10 minutes like Fallout 3. Compared to Fallout 3, it's very stable. While it's not better than Fallout 3, it's also not worse. The title was overhyped for how mediocre it actually is."

The story is not that great, but the ending, after the closing credits, somewhat redeemed the time I spent playing this game. What I disliked  The visuals in the last level were underwhelming, and the gameplay in the last level became increasingly frustrating, requiring me to repeat tasks numerous times before getting it right. Additionally, the achievements are disappointingly challenging, with only 13 (out of 15) achieved by less than 2.1% of players."

Considering the time I wasted on the first Ghost Warrior (which was equally boring and I feel liberated when I finished it), I probably won't play it until the end."

Single hits to the chest, neck, or head from rifle-caliber weapons almost always result in death unless it just grazes you. Rounds drop over distance and short, controlled bursts are required to remain on target. There's no magical ammunition pool. If you reload halfway through your magazine all the time, you'll have a pouch full of half-full mags. You can't run forever. If you sprint for a while, your aim will suffer as you gasp heavily until you've caught your breath. Rest your weapon on your elbows while prone or on a window sill to steady your aim. Accuracy suffers when standing."

However, despite these minuses, the game still has some variety and strategy to offer. It starts off fast and maintains a good pace.

Among this family, we identify a tracking solution with a single parameter to control simultaneously the fidelity of the transfer, the population of the excited state, and robustness. We define a measure of the robustness of an ultra-high-fidelity transfer as the minimum percentile deviation on the pulse areas at which the infidelity rises above 10^-4.

Our results apply to the setting where the true mixture components satisfy a certain separation condition, and are valid even when the number of components is over- or under-specified. For Gaussian mixtures with three components, we obtain sharper results in terms of the scaling with the separation between the components."

A widely used tool for detecting entanglement is the entanglement witness, where the measurement of the witness operator is guaranteed to be positive for all separable states and can be negative for certain entangled states. In reality, as the Hilbert-space dimension exponentially increases with respect to the system size, it is extremely challenging to construct an efficient entanglement witness for general multipartite entangled states. For n-partite GHZ-like states, the most robust witness scheme requires n+1 local measurement settings and can tolerate up to 1/2 white noise. In comparison, the most efficient witness for GHZ-like states only needs two local measurement settings and can tolerate up to 1/3 white noise."

The latter can break the axial and equatorial symmetry of the Kerr metric and exhibit a much richer multipolar structure, providing a gateway to constrain fuzzball models phenomenologically. We find numerical evidence that all multipole moments are typically larger (in absolute value) than those of a Kerr black hole with the same mass and spin. Current measurements of the quadrupole moment of black-hole candidates impose only mild constraints on fuzzballs, while future gravitational-wave detections of extreme mass-ratio inspirals with the space mission LISA will significantly improve these bounds by orders of magnitude."

To alleviate these issues, we propose a model based on temporal point processes and variational autoencoders that learns to infer temporal attention between nodes by observing node communication. As temporal attention drives between-node feature propagation, using the dynamics of node interactions to learn this key component provides more flexibility while simultaneously avoiding issues associated with human-specified edges."

In this case, carefully measuring the azimuthal decay angles ""resurrects"" the interference, recouping sensitivity to the ""non-interfering"" operators. We explore these signatures in detail, and find that the EFT uncertainties associated with higher-dimensional operators are uniquely well-suppressed by the construction of an asymmetry variable, which is only generated by these non-interfering operators, relegating the effects of higher-dimensional, interfering operators to the same status as statistical errors in this observable."

This note shows that, for a generic Einsteinian quantum theory of gravity in AdS, the stability of extreme black branes is in tension with rigorously proven quantum information theorems about entanglement entropy. Avoiding the contradiction leads to a non-perturbative version of the WGC, which reduces to the usual statement at weak coupling.

Here, we demonstrate superfluidity in an ultracold 2D Fermi gas by moving a periodic potential through the system and observing no dissipation below a critical velocity v_c.

We identify the influence of a chiral chemical potential, i.e., the electron population imbalance between Weyl nodes of opposite chirality, on the transport characteristics of the junction. Remarkably, we observe a net spin polarization of Cooper pairs generated via Andreev reflection in the two WSM regions.

However, a concern for the use of this method is the long-term stability of the implantation-induced conductivity, particularly if the implanted metal species is readily oxidized. Here, we report on our examination of the long-term behavior of the surface conductivity of titanium-implanted alumina.

The kinematics of both families are very different, and only the former is self-similar. The latter is responsible for most of the kinetic energy of the flow, and its vortices form the dipoles and the streams. Mechanisms are discussed for the growth of this slow-moving component."
225,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,paper_abstract,"Continuous-time quantum walks have been proven to be an extremely useful framework for the design of several quantum algorithms. Often, the running time of quantum algorithms in this framework is characterized by the quantum hitting time  the time required for the quantum walk to find a vertex of interest with a high probability. In this article, we provide improved upper bounds for the quantum hitting time that can be applied to several continuous-time quantum walk-based quantum algorithms. In particular, we apply our techniques to the glued-trees problem, improving their hitting time upper bound by a polynomial factor  from O(n^5) to O(n^2 log n). Moreover, our methods also enable exponentially improved dependence on precision of the continuous-time quantum walk-based algorithm to find a marked node on any ergodic, reversible Markov chain by Chakraborty et al."

Dry (or the ""loss-cone"") EMRIs, previously considered as the main EMRI sources for the laser interferometer space antenna, are primarily produced by multi-body scattering in the nuclear star cluster and gravitational capture. In this letter, we highlight an alternative EMRI formation channel  (wet) EMRI formation assisted by the accretion flow around accreting galactic-center massive black holes (MBHs). In this channel, the accretion disk captures stellar-mass black holes that are initially moving on inclined orbits, and subsequently drives them to migrate towards the MBH, boosting the formation rate of EMRIs in such galaxies by orders of magnitude."

Under such circumstances, we still expect our recommender systems to attract the users at the first time so that the users decide to stay on the website and become active users. This problem falls into the new user cold-start category and is crucial to the development and survival of a company. Existing works on user cold-start recommendation either require additional user efforts, e.g., setting up an interview process, or make use of side information such as user demographics, locations, social relations, etc. However, users may not be willing to take the interview and side information on cold-start users is usually not available."

It has also been successfully applied in wireless communications, even though the current radio systems are well-understood and optimal algorithms exist for many tasks. While some gains have been achieved by learning individual parts of a receiver, a better approach is to jointly learn the whole receiver. This, however, often results in a challenging nonlinear problem, for which the optimal solution is difficult to implement. To address this, we propose a deep fully convolutional neural network, deeprx, which executes the whole receiver pipeline from frequency domain signal stream to uncoded bits in a 5g-compliant manner. We facilitate accurate channel estimation by constructing the input of the convolutional neural network in a very specific manner using both the data and pilot symbols."
229,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,paper_abstract,"Mutation-based fuzzing typically employs an initial set of non-crashing seed inputs, a corpus, from which to generate new inputs through mutation. This corpus of potential seeds often contains thousands of similar inputs. The lack of diversity in this corpus can lead to inefficient fuzzing efforts by exhaustive mutation from all available seeds. To address this, fuzzers come with distillation tools, such as afl-cmin, that select the smallest subset of seeds that trigger the same range of instrumentation data points as the full corpus. It is common practice to suggest that minimizing the number and cumulative size of the seeds leads to more efficient fuzzing, which we systematically explore. Our results from 34+ cpu-years of fuzzing with five distillation approaches reveal the impact in finding bugs in real-world software."
230,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,paper_abstract,"In this paper, we investigate multi-agent discrete-event systems with partial observation. The agents can be grouped into several categories, each comprising agents with similar (isomorphic) state transition structures, which can be relabeled to the same template. Based on this template, a scalable supervisor is designed for the case of partial observation, whose state size and computational cost are independent of the number of agents. The scalable supervisor under partial observation does not require re-computation regardless of the number of agents added to or removed from the system. We generalize our earlier results to partial observation by proposing sufficient conditions for safety and maximum permissiveness of the scalable least restrictive supervisor on the template level. An example is provided to illustrate the proposed scalable supervisory synthesis."

An efficient approach for ENF estimation is introduced, utilizing temporal windowing based on the filter-bank capon spectral estimator. A type of Gohberg-Semencul factorization of the model covariance matrix is employed due to the Toeplitz structure of the covariance matrix. Moreover, this approach utilizes a temporal window, not necessarily rectangular, at the stage preceding spectral estimation. Krylov matrices are leveraged for fast implementation of matrix inversions. The proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in ENF estimation, when a short time window of 1 second is employed in power recordings. In speech recordings, the proposed approach yields highly accurate results with respect to both time complexity and accuracy."

Here, we investigated the fluorescence anomalous saturation effect of the nitrogen vacancy defect in diamond. The fluorescence reduction was observed with high-power laser excitation. It increased the nonlinearity of the fluorescence emission, and altered the spatial frequency distribution of the fluorescence image. We employed a differential excitation protocol to extract high spatial frequency information. By modulating the excitation laser's power, we improved the spatial resolution of imaging, approximately 1.6 times higher than confocal microscopy. Due to the simplicity of the experimental setup and data processing, we anticipate this method can be used for improving the spatial resolution of sensing and biological labeling in solids."
234,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,paper_abstract,"When random effects are correlated with sample design variables, the traditional approach of using individual survey weights (constructed to be inversely proportional to the unit survey inclusion probabilities) to form a pseudo-likelihood no longer yields asymptotically unbiased inference. We develop a weight-exponentiated formulation for the random effects distribution that achieves unbiased inference for generating hyperparameters of the random effects. We contrast our approach with frequentist methods that rely on numerical integration to reveal that only the Bayesian method achieves both unbiased estimation with respect to the sampling design distribution and consistency with respect to the population generating distribution. Our simulations and real-data examples for a survey of business establishments demonstrate the utility of our approach across different modeling formulations and sampling designs. This work serves as a culmination for recent developmental efforts that combine traditional survey estimation approaches with the Bayesian modeling paradigm, providing a bridge across the two rich but disparate subfields."

For the first time, it was found that in a mesogenic polymer, unlike low-molecular-weight mesogens, the relaxation of the electric birefringence of a melt above the temperature of the nematic-isotropic phase transition can be presented by a sum of several exponential processes, with two processes playing a decisive role. These main processes replace each other in a temperature range of approximately 50 degrees Celsius. Dielectric spectroscopy also enabled the distinction of two orientational relaxation processes  the first is attributed to the rotation of side mesogenic groups, and the second is associated with the motion of main chain segments."
237,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,paper_abstract,"Deep hashing methods have demonstrated exceptional retrieval accuracy and efficiency in large-scale image retrieval. The primary focus in these methods is on optimizing discrete hash bits. A common strategy in these methods is to adopt an activation function, for instance, the sigmoid or tanh, and minimize a quantization loss to approximate discrete values. However, this paradigm may lead to more and more hash bits being stuck in the wrong region of the activation functions, failing to escape. We refer to this issue as the 'dead bits problem'. Moreover, the existing quantization loss will exacerbate dbp. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective gradient amplifier that acts before activation functions to mitigate dbp."

We consider both the possibility that the triplets are stable and contribute to the dark matter density, or that they decay via mixing with the standard model Higgs boson. The former is constrained by disappearing charged track searches at the LHC and by dark matter direct detection experiments, while the latter is constrained by existing multi-lepton collider searches. We find that a two-step electroweak phase transition involving a stable triplet with a negative quadratic term is ruled out by direct detection searches, and an unstable triplet with a mass less than 230 GeV is excluded at 95% confidence level."

The standard scenario assumes an initially circular and narrow belt of planetesimals at semi-major axis a, whose eccentricity is increased to ef after the gas disc has dispersed by secular perturbations from an eccentric planet, resulting in a belt of width 2ae_f. A minor modification of this scenario, however, suggests that narrower belts can arise if the planetesimals are initially eccentric, which could result from earlier planet perturbations during the gas-rich protoplanetary disc phase. Alternatively, a primordial eccentricity could be caused by instabilities that increase the disc eccentricity, without the need for any planets."

In one dimension (1D), the physics of interacting electrons is captured well at low energies by the Tomonaga-Luttinger-liquid (TLL) model, yet little has been observed experimentally beyond this linear regime. Here, we report on measurements of many-body modes in 1D gated-wires using a tunnelling spectroscopy technique. We observe two separate Fermi seas at high energies, associated with spin and charge excitations, together with the emergence of three additional 1D'replica' modes that strengthen with decreasing wire length. The effective interaction strength in the wires is varied by changing the amount of 1D inter-subband screening by over 45%."

It is likely that the globular cluster system of our galaxy has followed a similarly intricate formation path. To constrain this formation path, we explore the link between the globular clusters and the known merging events that the Milky Way has experienced. To this end, we combined the kinematic information provided by Gaia for almost all galactic clusters, with the largest sample of cluster ages available after carefully correcting for systematic errors. To identify clusters with a common origin we analyzed their dynamical properties, particularly in the space of integrals of motion. Results show that about 40% of the clusters likely formed in situ."

In detail, the methods included in this package are the two-nn, gride, and hidalgo models. To make these novel estimators easily accessible, the package contains a few high-level, intuitive functions that rely on a broader set of efficient, low-level routines. Intrinsic encompasses models that fall into two categories  homogeneous and heterogeneous intrinsic dimension estimators. The first category contains the two-nn and gride models. The functions dedicated to these two methods perform inference under both the frequentist and Bayesian frameworks. In the second category, we find hidalgo, a Bayesian mixture model, for which an efficient Gibbs sampler is implemented."

In this paper, we identify a surprising consequence of popularity-based rankings  the fewer items reporting a given signal, the higher the share of the overall traffic they collectively attract. This few-get-richer effect emerges in settings where there are few distinct classes of items (e.g., left-leaning news sources versus right-leaning news sources), and items are ranked based on their popularity. We demonstrate analytically that this few-get-richer effect arises when people tend to click on top-ranked items and have heterogeneous preferences for the classes of items. Through simulations, we analyze how the strength of the effect changes with assumptions about the setting and human behavior. We also test our predictions experimentally in an online experiment with human participants. Our findings have important implications for understanding the spread of misinformation."

However, most pruning techniques are essentially trade-offs between model accuracy and regularity, leading to impaired inference accuracy and limited on-device acceleration performance. To address this issue, we introduce a novel sparsity dimension, namely pattern-based sparsity, which combines pattern and connectivity sparsity, and proves to be highly accurate and hardware-friendly. With carefully designed patterns, our approach consistently achieves accuracy enhancement and better feature extraction ability on different DNN structures and datasets, and our pattern-aware pruning framework also enables pattern library extraction, pattern selection, pattern, and connectivity pruning and weight training simultaneously. Our approach naturally fits seamlessly into compiler optimization for highly efficient DNN execution on mobile platforms."

We investigate the effect of mountaintop removal mining (MRM) on mortality using a difference-in-differences analysis that leverages the increase in MRM following the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments.

(laughs) I was a self-employed living statue called the eight-foot bride, and I love telling people I did this for a job, because everybody always wants to know, 'Who are these freaks in real life?' (laughs) Hello. I painted myself white one day, stood on a box, put a hat or a can at my feet, and when someone came by and dropped in money, I handed them a flower – and some intense eye contact. And if they didn't take the flower, I threw in a gesture of sadness and longing – as they walked away."
269,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,speech,"On October 4, 1957, the world witnessed a pivotal moment in history as the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the world's first artificial satellite, into space. This small, two-foot-diameter metal sphere sparked a space race between the US and USSR that would last for eighteen years and revolutionize our understanding of the world. Interestingly, Sputnik was not the first human-made object to venture into space. That distinction belongs to the V-2 rocket, used by Germany during World War II in missile attacks against Allied cities. Although ineffective, the V-2 rocket technology and its scientists were captured by both the US and USSR at the war's end, and were subsequently repurposed for their own projects."

As a voracious reader, I enjoy devouring works by Ian McEwan and Stephanie Meyer, having even read the Twilight tetralogy. In my free time, I indulge in my home theater, where I watch DVDs, video on demand, and a significant amount of television. For me, shows like 'Law & Order  SVU,' Tina Fey's '30 Rock,' and 'Judge Judy' are must-watches – 'the people are real, the cases are real, the rulings are final.'"

I am pleased to bring you a message from António Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations. The climate emergency is the defining crisis of our time. We are racing against time, and we are losing. There is a growing tide of impatience, particularly among young people, with global inaction. We need more ambition from all  governments, cities, businesses, investors, and individuals everywhere. I am pleased you are launching the Countdown. Your influence and ideas can help accelerate momentum for a carbon-neutral world by 2050. That is the only way to avert the worst impacts of global heating. We have the tools, the science, and the resources. Let us now get into this race with political will and energy."

A simple word describing a natural biological process, weighed down by centuries of stigma, has been transformed into something most of us can only speak about in whispers. But why? As I speak to you right now, more than 800 million women around the world are having a period. None of us would exist without it, and yet it remains an ""embarrassing"" subject to broach. From my experience and that of the women around me, I can tell you that it's exhausting – it's exhausting to carefully take out a brown paper bag, hiding a pad, stuffing it into your pocket in the middle of a class, rushing to the washroom as discreetly as possible. It's exhausting to sit through lessons and meetings, pretending to be absolutely normal, while internally crying out from intense period cramps."

It spans across northern Canada, including Labrador, where it's home to the largest remaining wild caribou herd in the world – the George River caribou herd, numbering approximately 400,000 animals. Unfortunately, during my visit, I couldn't find one of them, but I have the antlers as proof. Throughout the boreal forest, we're fortunate to have this incredible abundance of wetlands. Wetlands, globally, are one of the most endangered ecosystems. They're absolutely crucial ecosystems, as they purify the air, clean the water, sequester large amounts of greenhouse gases, and provide a home to a vast diversity of species."

Four brothers roamed this celestial realm, with no knowledge of their parents beyond each other - they didn't even know who their parents were. One of the brothers, Deminan, stood out from the others. His skin was covered in painful scabs, and he wondered why he alone had been marked with this affliction. One day, while the supreme spirit Yaya was out in his gardens, Deminan and his brothers sneaked into Yaya's house. After feasting and exploring, they spotted a giant gourd hanging in the corner. But as they tried to look inside the gourd, they dropped it."

At the time, there wasn't much information available about the company, but what was there was truly impressive. Essentially, Theranos was creating a medical device that would allow you to run your entire blood panel on a finger-stick of blood. This meant you wouldn't have to get a large needle stuck in your arm to get your blood test done. This was intriguing not only because it was less painful, but also, it could potentially open the door to predictive diagnostics."

We lived with the Inuit in the tiny Inuit community of 200 Inuit people, where we were one of three non-Inuit families. In this community, we didn't have a television; we didn't have computers, obviously, or radio. We didn't even have a telephone. All of my time was spent outside with the Inuit, playing. The snow and ice were my sandbox, and the Inuit were my teachers. And it was there that I became truly obsessed with this polar realm."

That's our mission  to contain them, guide them, and provide a second chance, over the years, as a society, we've developed expertise in doing so, but that shouldn't make you complacent.

For the past two years, it has been my passion to escort and land the probe on a comet. To do so, I must first explain the origin of our solar system. When we travel back in time approximately 4.5 billion years, we find a cloud of gas and dust. At the center of this cloud, our sun formed and ignited. Alongside that, what we now know as planets, comets, and asteroids formed. According to theory, when the Earth had cooled slightly after its formation, comets massively impacted the Earth, delivering water and possibly complex organic material, which may have kickstarted the emergence of life."

You know, when we created this 'build back better' series, our thought was, 'How can we address issues arising out of the pandemic? How can we imagine building back from that?' But the events of this past week, the horrific death of George Floyd and the daily protests that have followed, I mean, they've provided a new urgency that we simply have to address. I mean, can we build back better from this? I think before we can even start to answer that question, we just have to seek to understand the enormity of this moment.

President Theodore Roosevelt slept in a grove of towering sequoia trees, braved a snowstorm, and spent hours engaging in lively conversation around the campfire with his host and guide, conservationist John Muir. Roosevelt was famously enamored with the outdoors, but Muir had invited him to Yosemite for more than just a camping excursion  the valley was in danger. Although Yosemite had been protected land since 1864, it was still at risk of overdevelopment in 1903. It was at the heart of a decades-long struggle to set aside land for both preservation and public use – two goals that were easier said than done. The battle over Yosemite began with the 1849 gold rush, when miners flocked west, seeking gold in the Sierra Nevada foothills."

Unfortunately, I live in Gaza, where there are no airports. All borders are closed on every side. We live in one of the world's largest prisons. The only thing I can do is just look up at the sky.

My journey began 14 years ago, when I was a young reporter fresh out of college. I received a scoop, a relatively straightforward story. Police officers were accepting bribes from street vendors. As a young journalist, I believed I should approach the situation differently, to maximize the impact, since everyone knew it was happening, yet nothing was being done to stop it. I decided to go undercover, posing as a vendor. As part of my cover, I gathered concrete evidence. The outcome was remarkable. This is what many call immersion journalism, or undercover reporting."

A new drug has been found to prolong the lives of patients with a rare disease. Health headlines like these are published daily, often making seemingly contradictory claims from each other. There can be a disconnect between the broad, attention-grabbing headlines and the often incremental results of the medical research they cover. To avoid being misled by grabby headlines, it's essential to assess a headline's credibility by looking at the original research it reports on. We've developed a hypothetical research scenario for each of these three headlines. Keep watching for the explanation of the first example; then pause at the headline to answer the question. These are simplified scenarios."

Then my mom said, 'Well, Kristin, neither of your little brothers have a birth certificate, so how do you suggest we figure out when that was?' Mind blown. Now, 20 years later, I'm still working on it, except instead of trying to solve the mystery of my brothers' missing birth certificates, I try to solve this problem globally. So, what do birth certificates have to do with international development?"

If you were given the choice to sign up for that kind of existence, would you? That's the question philosopher Robert Nozick posed through a thought experiment he called the experience machine. The experiment asks us to consider a world in which scientists have developed a machine that would simulate real life while guaranteeing experiences of only pleasure and never pain. The catch is that you would have to permanently leave reality behind, but you wouldn't even notice the difference. Your experiences would be indistinguishable from reality. Life's natural ups and downs would simply be replaced with an endless series of ups. Sounds great, doesn't it?"

This was because it became clear that the next big threat facing not only my city, but also cities around the country, was not the one-and-done disaster, where you can ride in like the cavalry, as a firefighter, put out the fire and leave, feeling like you've made a difference, and everything is okay."
288,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,speech,"Where does all the carbon dioxide we release go? Carbon plays a natural cycle, present in all living things  in the soil, in the oceans, in the atmosphere, and in rocks deep underground. When plants and other living organisms die, much of their stored carbon is released back to the atmosphere, where it's reabsorbed by new plants and organisms. However, over millions of years, some of the carbon stored in ancient trees and sea life becomes rock, and some becomes fossil fuels  coal, oil, and natural gas. Natural events like volcanic eruptions release some of the carbon trapped in rock. Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, also release some of that prehistoric carbon. Today, humans release approximately 60 times more carbon dioxide than all the volcanoes on the planet each year."
289,hybrid,none,none,polish_extreme_minor,speech,"Even nature's most reviled creatures possess important secrets, but who would welcome a swarm of cockroaches approaching them? Yet, one of the greatest differences between natural and human technologies lies in robustness. Robust systems are stable in complex and novel environments. Notably, cockroaches can self-stabilize while running over rough terrain. When we equipped them with a jet pack or subjected them to a perturbation like an earthquake, we found that their exquisitely tuned legs enable self-stabilization without requiring any brainpower. They can traverse complex terrain like grass without issue, and remain unstabilized. We discovered a new behavior where, due to their shape, they automatically roll onto their side to navigate this artificial grass obstacle. Robust systems can perform multiple tasks with the same architecture. Here, we've uncovered a new behavior."

Sperm donors are often referred to as ""biological fathers,"" but should we really be using the word ""father"" as a title? As a philosopher and social scientist, I have been studying these questions about the concept of parenthood. But today, I will talk to you about what I learned from talking to parents and children.

But what got me from there to here wasn't the punishment I faced as a teenager in adult prison or the harshness of our legal system. Instead, it was a learning environment of a classroom that introduced me to something I didn't think was possible for me or our justice system as a whole.

If some of your perceptions were negative, I don't really blame you. That's just how the media has been portraying people who look like me. One study found that 80% of news coverage about Islam and Muslims is negative. And studies show that Americans say that most don't know a Muslim. I guess people don't talk to their Uber drivers.

And, like too many 20-somethings, I expected to solve the world's problems – more specifically, the world's water problems – with my technology. I had a lot to learn.

Those air vibrations are traveling to you, they're hitting your eardrums, and then your brain takes those vibrations from your eardrums and transforms them into thoughts. I hope that's happening.
