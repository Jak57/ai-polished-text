1,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,blog,"Another week has flown by. I drove past the new house yesterday and noticed the front window was covered in boxes. We might receive the keys at closing, and I'm getting increasingly excited. If everything goes smoothly this week, we'll be on track for closing a week from Wednesday. I stayed up late last night, watching movies with Bethany until after 3:00am. There's been a movie marathon of sorts going on around here lately. Here's my rundown: last night we watched ""Thirteen,"" a film every mother of a teenager should see. It exceeded my expectations. We also watched ""Gigli,"" which, unfortunately, lived up to its poor reviews, but we had to see it for ourselves."
2,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,blog,"Summer TV used to be a dead zone filled with repeats, but now there are two great new shows that have caught my attention. I've been watching them religiously for the past week. One of them, ""Blow Out,"" has a concept that's almost laughably over-the-top, yet somehow lacks any visible gay presence. The show revolves around hairstylist Jonathan Antin, who wants to expand his incredibly popular West Hollywood salon to a second location in Beverly Hills. Normally, this wouldn't be of interest to me, but while flipping through channels, I caught a glimpse of Jonathan, who exudes equal parts narcissism and dullness, standing in an empty space on Rodeo Drive and proclaiming, ""I'm going to build the greatest salon in the history of the world!"" I was hooked. It's been a while since I've found someone as moronically compelling as Rocco, making for some entertaining TV."
3,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,blog,"What a week... I've developed tendonitis in my right shoulder, just under my shoulder blade. Whenever I move my arm excessively, particularly when using a computer mouse, it's excruciating. Unfortunately, I've been on a marathon updating my website and working on other online projects, which has left me with limited mobility. I'm struggling to muster the strength to draw anything. The lack of sleep isn't helping, either. I'm not in the best of spirits right now, but I'm optimistic about a full recovery. On a more positive note, my mom's surgery was successful, and her eyesight has started to return. She can now see blurry shapes and distinguish colors, although her vision is still severely impaired. Hopefully, she'll regain her full vision soon."
4,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,blog,"The kindness of strangers... I attempted to do laundry today with the kids in tow and quickly realized how the simplest tasks can escalate into a chaotic ordeal. However, I also discovered the remarkable kindness of total strangers, who showed compassion for no reason other than the fact that they felt like being kind. Rest assured, it wasn't about ulterior motives - I was covered in kid drool and wearing my casual 'wash-day' outfit, hardly a sight to behold. To be honest, I'm not sure when I'll be bathing again, so there wasn't even an olfactory incentive. Currently, I'm multitasking - composing this post while watching a collection of No Doubt music videos, all from the comfort of my desk in my room."
5,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,blog,"It's 11:14pm MST, and I'm sitting in my bedroom, fixing the personal computer of our personnel director from work. I don't mind doing favors, but I often wonder how frequently I end up fixing someone else's computer. I'm glad I can show love and care for people in this way, but I do question where the line is drawn before I'm taken advantage of. The past couple of weeks have been late nights spent reading, so I was looking forward to an early night's sleep, until I realized it would be more practical to return this computer to its owner as soon as possible. No rest for the weary, indeed. Instead, I found myself watching Joe Schmo 2 again tonight."
6,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,blog,"Remind me, what was I discussing before this, or is this a continuation of the 'is this a date?' saga? Following the awkward lunch, my confidence took a hit. I forgot to share a crucial part of the story with you all. Before Pat arrived for lunch, Dustin started talking about what a great guy Pat is and how he's trying to find him a girlfriend. As I listened and nodded, I realized we were spending more time discussing finding a girl for Dustin's best friend than engaging in typical conversation with a stranger over pink lemonade. I excused myself to the bathroom, caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror, and silently wondered: am I being set up with the other guy? Is this how things are supposed to go now?"
7,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,blog,"I wish everyone would think before acting. Ideally, I'd like every person in the world to start their day with a commitment to think critically, and maintain that mindset throughout. If they're not willing to do so, I'd rather they stayed in bed and avoided causing harm. I'm exhausted by the prevalence of thoughtless behavior. I'm not claiming to be the most intelligent person, but I'm not advocating for complex thinking either. I believe it's reasonable to hold people accountable for their inexcusable lack of common sense. Let's focus on a few specific examples for now and save the rest for another time, if that sounds agreeable."
8,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,blog,"Two issues with the scenario outlined in my previous post: 1. While it's true that Bush is stimulating the economy, he's doing so in an unideal manner. Robert Rubin, in an interview with NPR's Marketplace, pointed out that the same stimulus effect could have been achieved without incurring long-term debt by implementing temporary tax cuts that would benefit low- and middle-income individuals. The mention of Robert Rubin's name is indeed a welcome sound. It's worth noting that among Bush administration cabinet officials on the domestic side, few possess the same level of gravitas as Rubin. 2. We cannot afford to give Republicans control solely during wartime, as they have effectively created a perpetual, global 'war on terrorism' that shows no signs of abating."
10,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,blog,"Have you ever experienced one of those moments where you pause to reflect on life? Perhaps you're sitting in a math class, feeling utterly bored, and you start to wonder what processes in your brain enable you to comprehend math. You then realize your existence and the fact that you're in math class, prompting you to question the purpose of it all. This realization can be quite profound, as you begin to appreciate the beauty of simply existing. However, this train of thought is often short-lived, as you suddenly feel a pang of embarrassment at the randomness of your musings. It's a feeling that can be quite frustrating. On a related note, I have a strong dislike for block schedules. Who would conceive of such an idea? It's clear that sitting through a two-and-a-half-hour class in any subject is a form of cruel and unusual punishment."
11,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,blog,"I believe that Monopoly has run its course in my life, and I vow to never lay my hands on that iron game piece again. Tonight, Andy beat me by a few small dollars and won the game, or perhaps I let him win, considering he's leaving in a few short hours and I wanted him to feel good on his last night here. Whatever the story may be, it can't compare to this Texas-sized headache I have at the moment. I've taken some Aleve, and I must say they're doing the trick; all I need now is some well-deserved rest and relaxation. Your telephone's the one that helped me wrap the cord around your neck... At the drive-in."
12,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,blog,"Today's been a long day, having driven home from Indiana. I'll have to be selective about what I write, as I could easily fill a lot of space and time, but I'm running low on energy. To start, I have to say that camp was incredible, exceeding my expectations in every way. Lately, God has been doing some amazing things in my life, and it's truly awesome. I feel like I've turned a new leaf, but I'll get back to the beginning. We arrived at the Twiggs' house on Friday evening and stayed until we left for camp on Monday. During our visit, we attended the fair, church, a parade, went to Walmart, and watched movies."
13,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,blog,"Today marks the end of my summer vacation, and I'm not exactly thrilled about it. To make matters worse, I have a dentist appointment at 9. While I'm not looking forward to it, I'd rather get it over with now than try to squeeze it in during the first month of my surgery rotation. I'm feeling anxious, apprehensive, and more than a little resistant to the idea of going back to school. This is going to be a whole new challenge for me. As a perfectionist, I thrive on excelling in everything I do, but starting anew is daunting. I dislike being uncertain and out of control, like a pawn on a chessboard, and I especially hate not knowing what to expect."
14,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,blog,"Arun Shourie discusses how the current Governor of Uttar Pradesh had warned as far back as 1996 about the impending threat of the rise of a 'third Islamic state' in the subcontinent. T V Rajeswar, the former head of the Intelligence Bureau and the present Governor of Uttar Pradesh, had predicted this dire threat in a series of articles published in the Hindustan Times in 1996. Shourie raises a valid point when he asks, does the fact that it is now known that Rajeswar, rather than himself or Mr. Advani, wrote these warnings make them ring true? Or do we conclude that because Rajeswar expressed these concerns, he is a closet communalist and should not be allowed to continue as Governor of Uttar Pradesh?"
15,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,blog,"Attitude: bored, mood: indifferent, but looking forward to tonight. It's been a long, arduous day in the trenches, leaving little time to write for my readers. On a brighter note, it's great to see Tigger (now Akcron) taking the reins and making an appearance, sharing her thoughts. Unfortunately, I don't have much to share today. Yesterday's Shakespeare on the Green was a lovely play, although I had to leave before the final curtain, which was disappointing. Hopefully, I'll get to see a complete Shakespeare play someday. As an aside, Akcron is spot on about the issues with the shower - it's subpar. However, I must admit that witnessing someone's reaction to self-inflicted discomfort can be quite amusing, especially in the shower."
16,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,blog,"Over the past two days, I've been unexpectedly overcome with severe bouts of exhaustion - a bone-dead fatigue. Last evening, I went home and slept off, only waking up when my mother called me around 8:30. When I woke up, it was dark, and I hadn't switched on the lights, so for a few seconds, I was disoriented, with only my mother's voice in the darkness as I struggled to grasp reality. I'm still wondering why I'm feeling so drained. This morning, however, the weather was pleasant, with a gentle drizzle when I arrived. In contrast, I've heard that it's been raining in Calcutta for the past three days."
17,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,blog,"Last night was a disaster. I ended up discarding the sweater I was knitting, which was about 14 inches long. I likely lost around $10 worth of yarn, considering it costs $8 per skein. Unfortunately, the project had become unmanageable by the time I reached the armholes, with too many stitches and the mohair constantly knotting itself together as I knitted. As a result, frogging didn't work well, and the yarn kept breaking. Surprisingly, I didn't even swear, which is out of character for me. Instead, I morosely ripped out the rows while listening to season two of Sex and the City, courtesy of the library. Eventually, I grew tired of it and threw the sweater away. I suppose I can say that I gained valuable experience from attempting to make this sweater."
18,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,blog,"Last night in class, we delved into that week's assigned reading, ""Getting Back into Place: Toward a Renewed Study of the Place-World"" by Edward S. Casey. The first chapter explores ""implacement"" and the second, ""displacement."" In the first chapter, Casey distinguishes that our contemporary world and culture are centered around time as the primary situating force, where phrases like ""running out of time,"" ""saving time,"" and ""just in time"" dominate our discourse. He argues that by placing place at the heart of culture, we can foster a more grounded community. (Please note that this is a rough summary, and I offer this disclaimer in case my professor or classmates happen to read this post.) So far, this book is the first reading that has truly resonated with me."
19,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,blog,"Whatever it is they put into freeze pops to make them those vibrant colours, there should be some sort of warning label: may make your life a bit more bizarre. And while giggling is good for you, one can't help but wonder if we would have found ourselves climbing up that fire escape, drinking beer in the fierce wind, had we not been consuming them earlier. Finding ourselves in front of a doorway to a bar that was sadly closed for business, we stopped to browse through an office-supplies catalogue that had arrived in the mail. Fortunately, we did. Who could have possibly guessed that within these pages lay the special offers of a lifetime? Certainly not I. To name a few: purchase 36 permanent marker pens, receive a stunt kite free. Buy 30 lever arch files, get a complimentary barbecue."
20,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,blog,"Currently listening to: The Little Drummer Boy by Stevan Pasero. Now, onto my post. Senate Republicans, hands up – who watched the 39-hour judicial nominations marathon last week? I know I didn't, although I did tune in briefly a couple of times. The entire colossal waste of time was orchestrated by Republicans, who were furious that Democrats wouldn't rubber-stamp four of Bush's contentious judicial nominees. They attempted to score political points by staging a multi-day protest. It's worth noting that Democrats have already approved 168 of Bush's judicial nominees – apparently, that's not enough for the power-hungry Republicans, who seem to be operating under the misconception that they have a massive mandate for this kind of behavior."
21,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,blog,"This was a great weekend. I spent a lot of time outdoors, reconnecting with nature after a long hiatus, and rediscovered my love for Nevermore's music, something I should have done much sooner. I also managed to get a lot of reading done, finishing three books - Bruce Sterling's Heavy Weather, Larry Niven's World of Ptavvs, and Octavia Butler's Parable of the Sower. Heavy Weather was an engaging cyberpunk adventure set in a near-future USA ravaged by global warming and chaos. Although it was clever, well-paced, and convincingly portrayed, I have to admit that it didn't leave a lasting impression on me. The story and characters were well-crafted and vivid, but overall, it was a good book, rather than a great one."
22,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,blog,"Because this is the aftermath, the first week back from practicum was a struggle, but it's only in the second week that the smoke has really started to clear. Post-practicum trauma is a hidden epidemic that is only now coming to light. I was stricken, but an eventual meeting with the course coordinator allowed me to release my burden, and by doing so, I have prevented another person from being stuck with such a pedagogically deficient practicum school. Yesterday, Monday, I bumped into another aggrieved classmate who was quite determined to warn the student due to go to her school in the next practicum about how terrible it would be. I calmed her down and suggested that we should approach the administrator first."
23,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,blog,"Things are incredibly busy here at times, but there's always time for supposed stress-relieving activities. I've discovered that I'm not very skilled at 8-ball and ping pong. Rick, the Canuck, consistently beats me, and we often squeeze in a quick round on the ping pong table in our building's front lobby. Last night, I participated in an 8-ball tournament at the Hot Spot, our recreation tent equipped with a popcorn machine, multiple TVs, a jukebox, DVD rentals, a pool table, a dartboard, and a ping pong table. Although I was doing fairly well throughout my one game, I ultimately scratched on the eight ball. Despite the loss, I still had a good time, particularly with the two Dutch soldiers who joined the tournament."
24,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,blog,"Fall 1974: I was attempting, for what felt like the thirteenth time, to fight my way through the second chapter of my high school algebra book. I was not then, nor am I now, a math person - I hate math and have a deep-seated phobia of it. You get the picture. As I struggled to make sense of algebra, the doorbell rang. I put down my book and went to open the door, only to find no one there. Great, just what I needed. I returned to my studies and just as I was finding a glimmer of understanding buried in my subconscious, the doorbell rang again. My breakthrough vanished instantly. I went to the door, and once again, no one was there. Just what a struggling math student needs - an uninvited practical joker."
25,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,blog,"This past week has been nothing short of exhausting. I spent Tuesday through Thursday completing the move to my new classroom. The new room is bigger and closer to my grade level team, factors I must consider as I spend hours preparing it for the year. Had I known about the move prior to the end of the school year, I would have discarded many of the books and supplies I no longer use. Unfortunately, everything came with me. As a result, this week was spent moving, unpacking, and purging extensively. I must thank my teammate Jill for her assistance with all of this. Since she was still teaching in my old room this month, she and her students kindly moved almost my entire room for me."

Even if I never carried your child, even if we were never married, even if we were never officially a couple... I loved you deeply, and to this day, that feeling still resonates within my heart. I will always be reminded of the few nights we shared, our hearts and bodies entwined in a soulful embrace, bathed in the salty darkness of a beachside evening... or a kiss under the rain. Whenever a pang of sorrow pierces my heart, you will be there, that piece of you... bleeding the eternal love that once burned within me... and still remains. For heri."
27,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,blog,"I'm uneasy about this. Investigative reporting doesn't sit well with me, or rather, the article I'm working on and its implications make me uncomfortable. Maybe it's because I don't fully believe in it, which makes it hard for me to grasp the underlying emotions and passion that drive it. The fervor to question and challenge is something I'm not accustomed to. Growing up in a country where questioning authority was discouraged, and often met with severe consequences, including imprisonment and worse, has made me wary of exercising my freedom of speech. I'm not used to voicing my doubts openly, and I'm aware that I can be difficult to get along with."
28,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,blog,"We had an outing with my bank colleagues yesterday at Guintubdan, La Carolota. For most of us, it was our first time visiting the area. We embarked on a trek to the falls, which took around 30 minutes and left us all catching our breath. However, the effort was worthwhile as we finally reached our destination. The icy cold water was invigorating, and its chilliness was palpable, making our bodies feel numb. We only stayed for less than an hour before heading to the nearby waterfalls, which required another 30-minute trek. The trip was well worth it, though, as the falls exuded a calming ambiance, and the scenery was truly breathtaking. Being surrounded by nature was almost meditative, and I felt at one with the environment. Soaking in the cold water was like communing with Mother Earth, and the combination of the chilly air and water was so soothing that it could have lulled me to sleep."

It's one trait I didn't inherit from the Buenviajes, the desire to drink. While I do enjoy drinking on rare occasions, those instances are few and far between. With only a month left before Ed leaves, I think the reality of the situation is starting to sink in for Ed and the rest of us. For me, it's been a long time coming. I just hope Ed will be here for Bailey's surgery. We've been monitoring his swelling, and unfortunately, there's noticeable swelling."

Fortunately, I had brought a bag of eggs as a precaution, so Connor still had a great time searching for them in the park. On Sunday morning, he woke up thrilled to discover that the Easter bunny had visited. There's nothing quite like seeing the excitement on your child's face. Following the egg hunt, we attended church as a family. While the Easter bunny is a fun tradition, we make sure our kids understand the true meaning behind the holiday. This was Megan's first Easter, and she looked adorable in her jean dress and stockings."

Unfortunately, I made a mistake and had them delivered to my home instead of work, so I'll have to wait another four hours to get them. Argh! These are the Face boots and Tredair Flame boots - I'm really excited! On a separate note, I somehow managed to get a flat tire. Luckily, I'm at work, so my colleagues are going to inflate it for me and check if it holds air. If not, they'll change my tire and put the spare on. Thankfully, my spare is a full-sized one. I might even get to buy a new tire tonight - woohoo! Hamad Tire, here I come! I also thought I had found another VW, but that's a different story."
32,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,blog,"I've had a change of heart since my previous post, where I defended parents and almost took their side. Now, I'm not so sure. The truth is, parents don't know as much as they think they do. They believe they can read us like a book, deciphering our emotions just by looking at our faces. But the reality is, they have no idea. When I stormed upstairs after a heated argument with Nicole about Kelli, my parents wanted to know what was wrong. My response? They don't need to know everything. The situation with Nicole and Kelli is simple: they just don't get along."

I almost didn't make it to work on time due to a massive accident at 14th and Constitution, which turned traffic in Virginia into chaos. Fortunately, I managed to skillfully maneuver my car from the far left lane to the far right and get onto Route 50. This may not be relevant to anyone outside of this area, so it's not particularly noteworthy. Nevertheless, I'm relieved to be sitting here instead of still stuck in my car. Yesterday, Sara decided to Google me, and surprisingly, an email I wrote to Ivan Maisel on ESPN.com was published online. I had no idea it was selected, as I didn't think my argument was particularly well-written, but apparently someone thought otherwise."

I caught it right after school on Friday, which happened to be the opening day - thanks to Mike for the ticket. Daniel Radcliffe, aka Harry Potter, has grown up incredibly fast and is undeniably cute, and so is Malfoy, haha. The movie was all great, but I'd give it 4.5 stars since they omitted some crucial details. Overall, it was a good film. Although I didn't dress up for the movie, I did wear a Ravenclaw tie, despite being more of a Gryffindor fan myself. I might just have to see it again in a couple of weeks."

This time, I have hard pears and my own jar of peanut butter to dip them into, although it's still crunchy, not smooth, which I believe makes a difference. I'm slightly perturbed, having just realized that this supposedly healthy snack packs 614 calories per 100g serving - a fifth of our standard jar size, which is already smaller than usual. I'm trying not to think about it. I've just returned from an evening out at my old music teacher and friend's house. I did miss a show, but I recorded it, and I've also discovered that they're airing repeats of series 9 every morning at 9:55. It was good to see my friend - a bit strange, but good nonetheless."

The observers will come from the OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights. This will mark the first time such a team has been present for a U.S. presidential election. Meanwhile, a baker's dozen of congressional Democrats, including four New Yorkers, has petitioned U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to dispatch international observers to Florida to oversee this year's presidential balloting there. I humbly disagree. Based on the available information, the OSCE appears to be coming to learn from the U.S. election process, rather than to oversee it, which was the original partisan and childish call for U.N. intervention."

The combination of an impending period and forgetting to take Prozac until late in the day had left me feeling extremely sad and tearful. However, a surprise visit from my boyfriend, an ice cream sundae, and the comfort of holding his hand after a terrifying dream in which people started firing machine guns at the news bureau greatly improved my mood. I'm also relieved to have the morning off, but I do need to make a call to a man at KMIZ to obtain his rate card. Tonight, I'm looking forward to spending time with two of my closest friends, Amy and Kate, and hopefully squeezing in some study time. Tomorrow, I might also get to see someone I haven't seen in a while for our WW date."

I mean, seriously, do you really need to bring out the expensive china to feed an entire church choir? Anyway, she had an impressive array of dishes - saucers, teapots, coffee cups, wine goblets, water glasses, seven different types of forks and spoons, dinner plates, salad plates, dessert plates, soup bowls, and side bowls. I was taken aback. Then, she scolded me for eating appetizers while the turkey was cooking. I stood my ground, insisting I would eat what I wanted. After that, we had to rush to the hospital with my father."

By Gary Fineout and Alfonso Chardy, the June 29 citizenship ceremony in Jacksonville appeared to proceed as usual, with nearly 200 people departing as new US citizens. Just before the new citizens left, an immigration official overseeing the swearing-in ceremony encouraged them to visit a nearby voter registration table, a common sight at naturalization events. However, this particular table was unusual, as it was staffed by Republican volunteers, and the party affiliation box on the registration forms had been pre-checked to automatically register new voters as Republicans. This raised suspicions among attendees, including Linda Cross, who was present to witness her husband, Dario Cruz, take his citizenship oath."

There's nothing quite like 48 hours of daydreaming to recharge one's creative energy. As a foreigner, I have it relatively good, and my timing has been fortunate. The illustration work is the icing on the cake – I'd likely be more dissatisfied if that opportunity hadn't come my way. I'm aware that I'm not being fairly compensated, though. I'm getting hungry, so I might head to Speak Easy, the 'American-style' diner just across the street from the post office in my prefecture, to grab some Mexican food."

At 4:30 pm, my best friend Eric and his son Nunu arrived with a large pan of baked ziti. The tables were set, and the food I had prepared was ready. The doorbell rang nonstop, and before I knew it, my dear friend from Florida walked in, bringing a huge smile to my face. I had missed him dearly. The added surprise was that he brought his wife along, who is expecting - a thrilling experience for me, as I'll get to be an uncle of sorts. I spoiled her with an abundance of food and tiramisu, tray after tray."

As a non-American blogger, I've been somewhat hesitant to engage in certain discussions, particularly those surrounding flags, but since I initiated the topic, I suppose I should offer my thoughts. Firstly, I believe that enacting a law against flag-burning is utterly absurd. The moment you grant a symbol - any symbol - such automatic reverence and protection, you've taken a small yet significant step towards totalitarianism. Symbols are inherently subjective - they don't inherently represent anything; their meaning is derived from how they are perceived or the significance attributed to them."

I'm not entirely sure what to expect or how I'll take to it, but given the amount of time I spend in front of a screen, I might as well make the most of it and share the random thoughts that swirl around in my head.

Although I'm too exhausted to delve into the details, I do believe the film had potential. However, I think the filmmakers invested too much in the set design, which was indeed magnificent, and not enough in establishing a cohesive tone and theme. The story was retold, but it lacked the gripping quality that would have made it memorable. I didn't feel like I gained any new insights from watching it, and the character development was somewhat lacking. Furthermore, I was underwhelmed by the score, which seemed to be a less effective imitation of the one from Gladiator. The use of a moaning woman's voice in the background music worked in Gladiator because it complemented a genuinely captivating narrative, which wasn't the case here."

Notably, the rate schedule in effect from August 2000 through September 2000 results in a significantly higher commodity charge, as SDG&E customers will receive a lump sum reimbursement from SDG&E during these two months, leading to lower expected electric bills. Excluding the lump sum reimbursement from the implicit energy component, the average implicit commodity charge from June 2000 through January 2001 is 6.2 cents, while the average from February 2001 through December 2001 is 7.3 cents. Overall, the average implicit commodity charge from June 2000 through December 2001 remains at 6.9 cents, which would still be the case for deliveries starting on September 1, 2000."

I hope these daily updates on new developments are helping you stay informed about the latest happenings within our company. Here's a summary of key events from last week: we successfully executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney, securing additional credit lines worth $1 billion. Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will provide support for these assets. We have now secured a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which will be utilized to settle short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity. Furthermore, our Board of Directors has elected a new member, William Powers, Jr., the Dean of the University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas."

The order provides for $69 million in potential refunds, which can be settled either by payment or by providing cost justification. Although Enron was not named as one of the 13 parties found to be overcharging, PG&E was, with a total of $3.18 million. However, this matter is not yet resolved. The order only addresses January 2001 and promises further orders regarding December 2000 and benchmark prices through April 2001. The prices used to determine refunds were relatively high, at $273/MWh, based on gas prices, emissions costs, and an assumed heat rate of over 16,000. Regarding sales to California, we have successfully concluded at least one short-term sale and have discussed longer-term deals with the California Department of Water Resources, but we were still grappling with credit issues, as of my last update."

Absolutely amazing, I have nothing negative to say about this game as it has exceeded my expectations and will likely exceed yours too. The game features fluid movement, is bug- and crash-free, and offers a wealth of story content and options to keep you engaged, including multiple practices, events such as sponsorships, and games. This review is based solely on my experience with MyCareer, and so far, it's a perfect 10/10.

97,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"Magic fans, beware: Wizards seems hesitant to create a decent digital game. At its core, Magic: The Gathering is a social experience meant to be enjoyed with friends, sharing laughter, trash talk, and game-winning moments. Unfortunately, Wizards of the Coast appears to have lost sight of this. When playing with friends, you're unable to earn gold, which is a crucial aspect of the game. Gold is so vital that a daily cap has been implemented, likely to prevent the unlocking of all in-game content. However, be prepared for a lengthy and monotonous 1v1 grind against the computer or random opponents, with whom you can't even communicate. If you opt to play for free, expect to spend around 4 hours a day, solo, for over a month to unlock the cards."
98,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"As the third installment in the trilogy, I'll address the drawbacks first. I generally dislike prequels, as they technically move the story backward rather than forward, which is a common issue with prequels. However, they do offer additional storytelling opportunities. The combat feels somewhat sloppy and lacks the sharpness that Arkham City achieved. At the time of writing this review (26/10/2013), a game-breaking bug exists that prevents the completion of a side mission, although the main storyline remains unaffected. Some gadgets are assigned to inconvenient hotkeys, requiring excessive keyboard navigation, which can disrupt combos during combat."
99,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"They essentially perfected Shadow Warrior (2013) - the boss fights are impressive, the weapons feel great, although perhaps not quite as exceptional as those in D44M, but still solid nonetheless. Enemies aren't overly resilient, provided you're not mismanaging elemental and upgrade aspects. The upgrade system is well-balanced, and once you grasp it, it's not overly tedious. The elemental mechanics and limited ammo subtly encourage the use of diverse weapons. There are numerous unique and cool weapons that remain viable throughout most of the game, a notable distinction from the 'rng' formula found in Borderlands. The music is excellent, particularly the main theme and, of course, Stan Bush's contributions."
102,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"While I personally can't recommend this game, it's not entirely terrible. The gunplay is decent, provided you have the means to purchase gun parts, which is my primary concern: the game's pay-to-win model. If I could overlook this, the game would be enjoyable, as the hardsuit is fun to use and the HRV concept is excellent. I'd choose this game over any Call of Duty title, but the pay-to-win microtransaction format is off-putting for me. If you're comfortable with this model, then by all means, enjoy the game. However, if you're like me and dislike pay-to-win games, it's best to pass on this one; it's not our cup of tea."
103,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"While not perfect, this game has been incredibly enjoyable. The save system and risk of sudden death can be frustrating at times. During my first playthrough, I lost my main character around the 10-hour mark of a 20-hour campaign, and I would have appreciated the option to reload from a previous save. To mitigate such losses, I've resorted to using a third-party mod and save tool. Additionally, the aiming reticule is somewhat small, and the zoom feature could be more powerful. Despite these issues, the game has been a blast. As someone who isn't typically a fan of zombie games, I've been drawn in by the combination of strategy, missions, and first-person shooter and beat-em-up elements. I find myself playing as often as possible, always tempted to complete just one more mission or supply run before shutting down the game."
104,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"An absolutely great strategy game. Having played every other wargame, including European Escalation and ALB, I must say this one fits in perfectly. The vast number of units is impressive, with a staggering amount available. The graphics are stunning, the sounds are great, and the overall gameplay is epic. The in-game chat box at the main menu is also surprisingly entertaining. However, if you think this game is 'easy' or are new to the strategy genre, be prepared to invest significant time in mastering it. Don't get discouraged by losses - you will lose many units. Just remember to plan ahead, always have anti-air and anti-tank defenses in place."
105,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"I had a strong negative bias towards this game before playing it, and I was even hesitant to buy it. The concept of the portal gun and portals seemed unusual to me, despite my fondness for science fiction. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The jokes and voice acting in this game are truly phenomenal - just amazing. While it can be a bit cheesy at times, the humor is generally well-executed. Each story character has their own distinct sense of humor, and their unique personalities shine through. The level design is also impressive. Notably, I hadn't played the first Portal game before diving into the sequel, but I plan to do so when I have the time. In fact, playing the sequel is what sparked my interest in going back to play the original."
107,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"This game is a nostalgic treat for thirty-somethings who recall watching the Transformers cartoon in the UK, if only to endure the annoying Timmy Mallet for those five precious minutes. The voice actors for iconic characters like Optimus, Megatron, and Bumblebee have returned, and their voices are instantly recognisable. The classic cartoon transformation sound effect is also present. The cell-shaded graphics are flawless and quintessentially Generation One. Beyond the nostalgic value, the game is genuinely enjoyable. The combat mechanics are exceptionally well-executed, with mid-fight transformations often being a necessity that seamlessly integrates into combos, setting it apart from High Moon's excellent War for/Fall of Cybertron games. Another notable distinction is the emphasis on melee combat, although certain enemies, such as the Seekers, require a switch to a ranged blaster."
108,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"I downloaded the game and played it briefly, but it didn't leave a lasting impression. However, I spent more time trying to log in than actually playing, due to a bug that repeatedly prompted me to accept the updated terms of service. The issue was resolved only after restarting the client. What I found more concerning was the requirement to link my Steam and Gface accounts, supposedly for DLC purposes. I fail to see the necessity of this, and the fact that it's irreversible is unsettling, as it grants a company I'm not familiar with access to my Steam information. As for the game itself, it's mediocre and clearly inspired by Call of Duty, yet somehow manages to have inferior gunplay – a surprising feat in itself."

Just be aware that there's a significant amount of (skippable) dialogue. As usual, I recommend using a gamepad, but I personally had no issues with a keyboard and mouse setup, both of which are fully rebindable. The price is reasonable, and I wouldn't have been disappointed with a purchase. More than half of the DLC is included for free, providing plenty of content to play with. I highly recommend this game to all JRPG, anime, and visual novel fans, provided you don't mind the occasional long breaks between action sequences. Cheers.

110,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"I encountered no performance issues at launch, and with the numerous patches, the game runs smoothly. In my opinion, this is a truly great and enjoyable game, despite the somewhat frustrating format where the free-roam city area repopulates with new enemies upon progressing through the story. I particularly enjoyed the 'dual play' segments, which allow you to play as Batman alongside another character. The option to use a controller for most of the game, while switching to mouse and keyboard for tank combat segments, was a welcome feature. Driving the Batmobile around the free-roam city, including during APC commander chases, is quite enjoyable once you master the use of brakes to skid around corners, making navigation through the city a truly enjoyable experience."

It boasts impressive visuals, exceptional sound design, and outstanding gameplay - with great FPS mechanics, an engaging story, cool characters, flawless voice acting, and a killer soundtrack. However, it's not for the faint of heart, as some cutscenes can be quite brutal and vivid. When a game is this great, its flaws become more noticeable, and here are the ones I encountered: - The lack of SLI support is baffling; I had to put the game on hold until I upgraded my graphics card, as it struggled to run smoothly on my old dual-GPU GTX 590. Make sure you have a decent single-GPU card. - Some ridiculously small obstacles can be frustratingly unclimbable."
112,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"I am not a native English speaker, as Dutch is my native language. Please disregard any typing or grammatical errors in my review of this fantastic game. I will break down this review into several categories: graphics, controls, sound, gameplay, and replayability. 

Graphics: The game features a comic-like style, with very slick graphics that avoid unnecessary details. The color schemes are nice, and this aesthetic works well for the game. The graphics can be set to 'high' without putting excessive strain on your system. I run the game on an i5 Pentium processor, with an Nvidia GeForce 710m card and 8GB of memory, and it runs smoothly (Windows 8.1).

Controls: The game can be played using either a keyboard and mouse or an Xbox controller."
114,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"I'm two hours in and utterly enthralled by this game. The humor is hilarious, and the gameplay is solid. The art design is stunning, the music is surprisingly high-quality and fitting, the story and world have piqued my interest, and the puzzles are enjoyable. However, what truly sets this game apart is its comedic genius. If you're a seasoned RPG player, you'll appreciate the numerous jokes, parodies, and references that will have you laughing out loud. Even if you're new to RPGs, the game's humor is still sure to entertain. If you've played Final Fantasy 7 or X, this game is an absolute must-play – without giving too much away, I had to pause after two hours to give my cheeks a break from all the smiling and laughing. So far, it's been an absolute delight."
115,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"I apologize, but I must admit that I was disappointed with this game, despite my efforts to support free-to-play titles and indie developers. The description initially resonated with me, but the execution fell short. As a fan of puzzle and exploration games, I was surprised to find this game completely unintuitive, and even after seeking guidance, I couldn't find the gameplay enjoyable. Furthermore, the absence of a pause button, or at least one that I could find, seems like a significant oversight, particularly given the timed sequences. Unfortunately, I felt that the game was overly reliant on cutscenes, leaving me with extended periods of inactivity, waiting for the next interactive segment."
116,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"This game left me breathless - I'm still trying to process where to begin. It was stunningly beautiful, from the captivating storyline to the impressive graphics, I was completely enthralled. The narrative wasn't just a generic tale, but rather an immersive experience that made me feel like I was the protagonist, eagerly anticipating the next twist in the story. The gameplay was exceptional, and I gained valuable insights about myself, particularly my unexpected fear of heights, which was triggered by the ice caverns. My stomach was in knots throughout, but my determination to help Uncle Fred kept me going. If a DLC or sequel is in the works, I'd be the first in line to purchase it and wholeheartedly recommend it to everyone I know. A huge thank you to the entire team involved in creating this masterpiece - you've truly crafted a beautiful game."
117,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth is a turn-based game where you build your civilization to achieve a specific goal or 'victory'. Unlike previous games, which followed the Earth's timeline through periods such as the Stone Age, Medieval Age, and Modern Age, this game takes place in the future, where you're on a mission to colonize a new planet. What I appreciate about this game is that 2K took a fresh approach and introduced new mechanics, such as the affinity system and orbital layer. However, I found that these new features could sometimes make the game feel overwhelming. One potential area for improvement is incorporating new artwork, such as more immersive environments for diplomatic interactions with other leaders."
118,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"Great game with tons of replay value and an incredibly fun zombie survival experience. It's definitely among my top 5 zombie games of all time. After investing over 60 hours, I can confidently say that this is one of the better, more realistic zombie games out there. Its design is reminiscent of a survival horror, where you must conserve ammo, treat your own wounds, and take medication when infected. The zombie animations are surprisingly natural and well-done, especially considering it's a free-to-play game. One recommendation I'd make is to play with one or two friends, but the community is extremely friendly, making it easy to make friends or chat with others via voice comms or in-game chat."
119,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"02/07/2014 - Unfortunately, I'm unable to wholeheartedly recommend or enjoy this game due to two major issues that I've encountered during my brief playtime. Firstly, the lack of Australian servers is a significant drawback, as a single red bar results in a substantial disadvantage and unbearable lag. Notably, even the offline training mode was plagued by stuttering and lag, which is perplexing. When combined with poor ping, the overall gaming experience is severely compromised. Secondly, the game is marred by excessive artifacting, affecting menus, backgrounds, training, and in-game visuals. I've never experienced this issue with my graphics card before, and I initially suspected that it might be related to my overclocking settings. However, reverting my GPU to its stock settings did not resolve the problem."
120,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"I completed this late last night. Although the story isn't particularly deep or engaging, the storytelling is what sets it apart. The atmosphere is richly detailed, and the numerous collectibles do an excellent job of fleshing it out. I gained a lot of insight into the world of Batman, which made the limited number of bosses in the game somewhat disappointing. However, there are plenty of future games that can address this issue. The combat strikes a good balance of challenge, albeit on the easier side. Leveling up Batman wasn't particularly satisfying, but upgrading and acquiring new gadgets throughout the campaign added nice new gameplay mechanics. Gaining access to previously inaccessible areas provided a nice sense of progression."
121,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"'To the Moon' is no mere game... Nay, it is a veritable experience, and it ranks among the best of my life. While Telltale's 'The Walking Dead' is undoubtedly sad, it pales in comparison to the emotional depth of 'To the Moon'. Never before have I felt so simultaneously depressed and fulfilled by something purely fictional. In my opinion, this masterpiece represents the pinnacle of storytelling, with a gorgeously charming and perfect soundtrack to complement it. Although the controls can be finicky and the gameplay is not its strong suit, the story is so fantastic that I didn't care. The game's humor is also noteworthy, and it seamlessly integrates with the narrative without detracting from its distinguished nature. Furthermore, the numerous 'Doctor Who' references are a delightful bonus."
122,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"Bastion is a truly exceptional game, boasting a captivating storyline. Set in a post-calamity world, you embark on rebuilding the bastion. The game offers a considerable amount of choice, allowing you to decide what to build to gain an advantage, which weapons to wield, and what power-ups to equip them with, as well as selecting drinks that grant bonus effects. The art style and music are fantastic, with vibrant visuals that defy the notion that a post-apocalyptic world must be dull. One of the standout features is the dynamic narration, which responds to the player's actions, such as switching between weapons in the armoury, prompting the narrator to comment on the new choice."
123,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"I initially purchased this game during its early development stages, when the sole currency was spacebux and there was no 'tech tree'. This was the period when the game truly shone. At that point, all guns were equally overpowered, eliminating any balance issues; players could take each other down at any time. Furthermore, the game offered unlimited gun slots and five loadouts, allowing for greater flexibility. Given the game's claim of having 'bajillions of guns', it's surprising that players are now limited to just six weapon slots and three loadouts, with additional slots and loadouts available only through purchase. I once had an extensive collection of guns, spanning about three pages, and was brainstorming new ideas, as that's where I found the game to be the most enjoyable."
124,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"This game was a surprising gem, defying the often misleading rave reviews associated with certain products. In this case, the reviews accurately reflect the fun of this neat little game, which masterfully blends the classic 2D platformer with the MOBA genre, pulling it off with style. I found myself enjoying characters that I wouldn't typically appreciate in other MOBA games. Initially, I had expected this preference to hold, but I decided to give a melee tank a try anyway. The outcome was pleasantly surprising, and I ended up experimenting with more characters as they were unlocked through gameplay. The art style and interface have an oddly charming quality to them. As a result, I've adopted one of the characters as my avatar and even created a wallpaper from a card set inspired by the game."
125,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"I've just started playing, but I'm already hooked on this game. With my headphones on, I can easily lose myself in the game for hours on end. It's been a while since a game has had such a profound effect on me. The music perfectly sets the mood, the sound effects are spot on, and the controls are flawless. I eagerly anticipate every combat encounter, and the developers have clearly optimized the combat system to near perfection. Initially, I had my doubts about the naval combat system, but it's incredibly enjoyable to take down multiple fleets at once. The key to success lies in knowing when to retreat - if a battle seems overwhelming, it's best to regroup and launch a counterattack. Thanks to the developers for creating such an amazing experience!"
126,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"The reboot of the Devil May Cry franchise has introduced significant changes to the series, particularly for its protagonist, Dante. Although fans of the original series may be disheartened by the transformation of their beloved character, it is undoubtedly an improvement, as evident in this new game by Ninja Theory. DmC serves as an ideal entry point for newcomers to the series, showcasing the origins of a once arrogant and cynical Dante, and chronicling his journey from cynicism to selflessness. Throughout the game, a clear narrative arc is woven for the new Dante, rendering him a compelling character to watch. The story follows Dante as he is thrust into the corrupt world he had previously chosen to ignore."
127,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"Where do I even begin with this absolutely captivating game? Its story is undeniably charming, boasting an impressive level of detail and a delightful blend of happiness, humor, and intrigue. The game seamlessly balances its tone, shifting between serious moments and lighthearted humor with ease. The character design is exceptional, featuring a diverse cast with unique personalities and secrets waiting to be uncovered. What sets it apart from other RPGs is its refreshing approach, allowing players to progress without the need for violence – a concept rarely explored in the genre. Drawing inspiration from the beloved Earthbound, it's clear that this game is something special. The soundtrack, in particular, is outstanding, standing out as one of the best I've heard in a long time."
128,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"I'm recommending this solely because it's free, and it might offer a more enjoyable experience for others. However, personally, the game had little impact on me. Half of the story relies heavily on shock value, which failed to elicit any emotional response from me. I'm either desensitized to such tactics or the execution was too simplistic to evoke a reaction. The other half of the game attempts to portray a person's mental decline through a series of visual representations, exploring themes like obsession, hallucination, and depression. While the concept is intriguing in theory, the game's brevity – it took me only 10 minutes to complete, even with thorough reading and absorption of all available information – undermines its potential."
129,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"Do I even need to explain why Portal is amazing? Portal is a puzzle game that introduces a concept and then steps aside, allowing you to take the reins. It's an incredible way to challenge your mind while still being entertaining. Although this game isn't as story-driven, it did give birth to one of the most popular games of 2011. I still play this game and beat it when I'm feeling bored, and I love to revisit it to see what spawned a legend and what has become a legend. Gameplay: Portal's gameplay is relatively simple to explain. You utilize portals to your advantage, along with buttons that activate a part of the puzzle. There are two types of buttons in the game: one that you press directly and another that requires a cube to be placed on it."

As most reviews focus on system specs, I'll share mine: i5 6600k (~200€), Radeon RX480 (~200€), Z170 Pro Gaming (~150€), and 16GB DDR4 RAM (~70€), totaling ~650€, which falls within the medium price range.

I'm trying not to be overly biased, but the fact that this game allows you to transform into a dragon, supporting and commanding your troops while attacking and directing unit production and spawning, is a major draw. I've grown fond of complex RTS games like Civilization V, but those games often try to cram too many mechanics, charts, and resources into a single, convoluted game mode."
132,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"Undertale transcends the sum of its parts to create something truly remarkable. The solid retro graphics and pleasant music come together to form breathtaking and impactful moments. The script masterfully navigates a wide range of emotions, from comedic to dramatic to heartbreaking and hopeful, often simultaneously, while cleverly subverting RPG tropes. Without even delving into the world, characters, story, and gameplay, there's already so much to explore. But to put it simply: if you're an RPG fan, play this game. If you enjoy video games, play this game. If you have seven free hours to spare, play this game – it's an experience you won't regret."
134,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"I've had this game for just a few months, but in that short time, two DLCs have been released, along with patches that have transformed an already great game into an exceptional one. The developers are highly active in the community, and their engagement is evident in the discussion forums and dev diaries. While the game's mechanics have a fairly steep learning curve, which I'm still working to master, this depth of strategy offers a multitude of ways to achieve goals and capitalize on various situations. In my opinion, the game is nearly infinitely replayable. I find myself completely absorbed in every session, regardless of how the playthrough unfolds."
135,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"Warframe is an enjoyable game for the initial few hours of play, offering an engaging experience. However, as time progresses, the game's limitations become apparent, with repetition in combat, enemies, and gameplay becoming the primary focus. A notable exception is the developers' dedication to regular updates, which often include substantial content additions, such as significant system overhauls, new warframes, and various tweaks and features. This makes Warframe suitable for casual play. Nevertheless, its ability to sustain long-term interest is questionable, unless you have a strong affinity for grinding. On the positive side, the game is free, making it worth trying out, especially if you're looking for a brief gaming fix."
136,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"This game is extremely dull. I purchased it under the impression that it was a PC version of 'Katamari Damacy', a popular and enjoyable PS2 game. Unfortunately, it falls far short of expectations. The gameplay involves absorbing increasingly larger objects to grow bigger and absorb even more, but the experience is marred by a lack of smoothness, unoriginal levels, and a surreal atmosphere that borders on horror. However, it's not the entertaining kind of horror, but rather a bleak and depressing one that makes you question the value of existence. The depiction of 'living' creatures, from small pets to humans, is unsettling, leaving me to wonder if the game's creators have a fascination with taxidermy."
137,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"Let me explain a few things. As someone very interested in politics, I was immediately drawn to this game when I first heard about it. I thought, 'Wow, a simulator of the road to becoming president - that sounds like a lot of fun!' Unfortunately, it didn't quite live up to my expectations. The game begins by asking you to choose a side: Republican or Democrat, with no option for an independent or third-party candidate. Although this was a bit disappointing, I remained optimistic and continued to see what the game had to offer. One aspect that deserves credit is the character customization, which, although limited, is enjoyable to experiment with. It's also amusing to have the option to wear a hat or not during a campaign - a unique touch, indeed."

The aspects I enjoyed were: the visuals, which were impressive until the final level (ice caves), and although the story was not exceptional, the ending (following the closing credits) somewhat redeemed the time I invested in playing the game. On the other hand, I disliked: the unimpressive visuals in the final level, the significantly increased difficulty in the last level, which made the experience frustrating due to the need for repetition to achieve success, and the overly challenging achievements, with 13 out of 15 being achieved by less than 2.1% of players."
140,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"Pros: +graphics. Cons: -bugs, particularly in the environment, can cause issues such as getting stuck or hitting invisible walls despite having a clear line of sight to the enemy. -The game holds your hand excessively, making it feel overly guided. -The AI is unintelligent. -Enemies seem to always know your location once you're spotted. -Enemies have unrealistically high accuracy, which can be frustrating, similar to the first Ghost Warrior. -The checkpoint and save systems are poorly implemented. -The story is dull and unengaging, making it hard to care about the plot. I wouldn't recommend this game unless it's heavily discounted, even then, playing it feels like a chore. Having wasted time on the first Ghost Warrior, which was equally uninteresting and a relief to finish, I'm unlikely to complete this game, and will only play it to move on to the next title in my library."
143,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"I can appreciate why others enjoy this game, but it didn't resonate with me. As a Vive owner, I'm more inclined towards room-scale experiences that utilize controllers. While the game's vast universe is initially awe-inspiring, I found its scale to be a hindrance to my overall enjoyment. The learning curve and time required to accomplish anything meaningful at the beginning were too steep for me. If I had more patience and gaming time, I might find this game compelling. However, with limited time and numerous other VR games vying for my attention, I'd rather focus on those."
144,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"Hands down, my all-time favorite first-person shooter. This game isn't for run-and-gun Rambo types. Recoil and ballistics are remarkably realistic, with single hits to the chest, neck, or head from rifle-caliber weapons almost always resulting in death, unless the shot merely grazes you. Rounds drop significantly over distance, and short, controlled bursts are necessary to stay on target. There's no infinite ammunition pool; if you constantly reload mid-magazine, you'll end up with a pouch full of partially used magazines. Endless sprinting isn't an option either, as prolonged running will leave you gasping for breath, severely impacting your aim until you've caught your breath. To steady your aim, rest your weapon on your elbows while prone or on a windowsill. Accuracy also suffers when standing, making it essential to adapt your shooting stance."
145,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"I'd like to start by saying that I didn't purchase EU when it first launched, instead opting to buy it on sale, which included EW. As a result, I never experienced the issues that some players claim to have had with the game. Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed it, finding it to be challenging in the early stages but incredibly rewarding when executed correctly. Moving on to XCOM 2, I must say that I love the game, and it runs relatively smoothly for me on medium settings, despite my somewhat outdated hardware - a GTX 560 with 2GB of VRAM. Initially, the game defaulted to high settings, resulting in some minor performance issues, but dropping it down to medium resolved the problem. I'm not sure if I'm just fortunate when it comes to avoiding game-related issues or if there's another factor at play, but many of the negative reviews seem to be coming from individuals with unrealistic expectations."

However, the effectively linear interaction between motion and light or electricity limits access to a broader range of quantum states of motion, such as cat states and energy squeezed states.

However, these evaluations can be compromised by fake reviews, or 'spams,' generated by professional spammers who continually adapt and refine their spamming tactics to evade detection. The dynamic nature of these strategies makes them difficult to capture, as they can change rapidly over time, vary across spammers and target products, and often remain unknown. Moreover, existing detectors tend to prioritize detection accuracy, which may not align with the ultimate goal of maintaining trustworthy product evaluations. To address these challenges, we propose a minimax game framework where spammers and spam detectors engage in a competitive dynamic, driven by practical objectives that extend beyond mere detection accuracy. The Nash equilibria of this game yield stable detectors that are robust against diverse detection strategies."

To achieve high fidelity, we employed the Lewis-Riesenfeld method to derive a family of solutions that enable exact transfer, where the solutions follow a single dynamical mode of the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant. Among these solutions, we identified a tracking solution with a single parameter that simultaneously controls the fidelity of the transfer, the population of the excited state, and robustness. We defined a measure of the robustness of an ultra-high fidelity transfer as the minimum percentile deviation in pulse areas at which the infidelity exceeds $10^{-4}$. Our shaped pulses demonstrated superior robustness compared to Gaussian and adiabatically-optimized pulses for moderate pulse areas."

We demonstrate that all local minima exhibit a common structural form, which partially identifies the centers of the true mixture components. Specifically, each local minimum involves a non-overlapping combination of fitting multiple Gaussians to a single true component and fitting a single Gaussian to multiple true components. Our findings hold under a certain separation condition on the true mixture components and remain valid even when the number of components is over- or under-specified. Furthermore, for Gaussian mixtures with three components, we derive sharper results that scale with the separation between the components."

The first construction, due to Berglund-Hübsch-Krawitz (BHK), utilizes another weighted projective space and involves the quotient of a new hypersurface $x_{m^t}$ by a dual group $g^t$.

We demonstrate that this algorithm can accurately resolve near-collisions (with mutual separations of a fraction of the physical radius) using the same time-step as in weakly perturbed systems, such as the solar system. The long-term behaviour of the algorithm is showcased in a system of six super-Earths undergoing strong scattering over 50 kyr.

This witness operator guarantees a positive measurement for all separable states, while potentially yielding a negative result for certain entangled states. However, constructing an efficient entanglement witness for general multipartite entangled states is extremely challenging due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert-space dimension with respect to the system size. In contrast, for $n$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-like states, the most robust witness scheme necessitates $n+1$ local measurement settings and can tolerate up to $1/2$ white noise, whereas the most efficient witness for GHZ-like states requires only two local measurement settings and can tolerate up to $1/3$ white noise."

We have developed a general method for extracting the multipole moments of arbitrary stationary spacetimes, which we apply to a large family of horizonless microstate geometries. These geometries can break the axial and equatorial symmetry of the Kerr metric, exhibiting a more complex multipolar structure that offers a means of phenomenologically constraining fuzzball models. Our numerical analysis reveals that all multipole moments are generally larger in absolute value than those of a Kerr black hole with the same mass and spin. While current measurements of the quadrupole moment of black-hole candidates impose only mild constraints on fuzzballs, future gravitational-wave detections of extreme mass-ratio inspirals by the space mission LISA are expected to significantly improve these bounds, by several orders of magnitude."

A common scenario involves edges representing either short-term interactions, such as messaging, or long-term structural connections, like friendships. In practice, long-term edges are often manually specified by humans, which can be costly and suboptimal for downstream tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a model that leverages temporal point processes and variational autoencoders to learn temporal attention between nodes by observing their communication patterns. By driving between-node feature propagation through temporal attention, this approach offers greater flexibility while avoiding the drawbacks associated with human-specified edges, which are learned from the dynamics of node interactions."

Consequently, the splittings imply that certain long exact homotopy group sequences decompose into short exact sequences.

By referencing a true, yet unknown, population structure, the clustering problem can be framed within a standard inferential setting, where ideal population clustering is defined as the partition induced by the true density function. The nonparametric formulation of this approach, known as modal clustering, establishes a correspondence between groups and the domains of attraction of the density modes. Operationally, a nonparametric density estimate is necessary, and the proper selection of the amount of smoothing, which governs the shape of the density and potentially the modal structure, is crucial for identifying the final partition.

However, helicity selection rules for diboson scattering amplitudes pose an obstruction to the naive interference contributions of dimension-six operators, causing the leading contribution to the total diboson rate correction to cancel. In this case, precise measurements of the azimuthal decay angles can ""resurrect"" the interference, thereby recouping sensitivity to the ""non-interfering"" operators. We explore these signatures in detail and find that the EFT uncertainties associated with higher-dimensional operators are uniquely well-suppressed by constructing an asymmetry variable that is generated solely by these non-interfering operators, effectively relegating the effects of higher-dimensional, interfering operators to the same status as statistical errors in this observable."

Similar to previous frameworks, we categorize the scientific contributions of data science into three primary tasks: description, prediction, and counterfactual prediction, which encompasses causal inference. A clear classification of data science tasks is essential for discussing the data, assumptions, and analytics required to successfully accomplish each task.

This note demonstrates that, for a generic Einstein quantum theory of gravity in AdS, exact stability of extremal black branes is at odds with rigorously established quantum information theorems regarding entanglement entropy. Resolving this contradiction leads to a nonperturbative formulation of the WGC, which reduces to the standard statement at weak coupling.

Notably, it offers a means of grading the voltage drop across high-voltage insulators, thereby enabling the application of higher operational voltages without surface flashover. However, a key concern regarding this method is the long-term stability of the implantation-induced conductivity, particularly when the implanted metal species is prone to oxidation. This study examines the long-term behavior of the surface conductivity of titanium-implanted alumina, revealing an initial decrease of up to 40% in the first few weeks following implantation, followed by a gradual decline of approximately 10% over the subsequent year."
222,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"We introduce a novel Skyrme-like conserved current within the effective theory of pions and vector mesons, grounded in the concept of hidden local symmetry. The corresponding charge is equivalent to the skyrmion charge for any smooth configuration. Furthermore, singular configurations exist that can be identified as n_f=1 baryons, which are charged under this new symmetry. Under this identification, vector mesons assume the role of Chern-Simons vector fields residing on the quantum Hall droplet that constitutes the n_f=1 baryon. We propose that this current provides the correct effective expression for the baryon current at low energies. This proposal offers a unified framework for the two types of baryons, enabling a natural and continuous transformation between them. Additionally, Chern-Simons dualities on the droplet can be interpreted as a manifestation of Seiberg-like duality between gluons and vector mesons."
223,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"Interfacial spin-orbit coupling in Josephson junctions presents a fascinating opportunity to merge anomalous Hall and Josephson physics within a single device. We theoretically investigate how the interplay between these two effects influences the transport properties of superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator/superconductor junctions. The transverse momentum-dependent skew tunneling of Cooper pairs through the spin-active ferromagnetic insulator interface generates substantial transverse Hall supercurrents, which we term anomalous Josephson Hall effect currents. By extending the Furusaki-Tsukada formula, originally developed to quantify conventional Josephson current flows, we evaluate the transverse current components and show that their amplitudes can be broadly tuned through the spin-orbit coupling strengths or the superconducting phase difference across the junction. A distinct spectroscopic signature of Josephson junctions, well-localized subgap bound states form in the vicinity of the interface."
224,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"Following the suggestion from Monte-Carlo experiments in Jiménez (J. Turbul., 2020), which indicate that dipoles are as crucial to the dynamics of decaying two-dimensional turbulence as individual vortex cores, it is discovered that the kinetic energy of this flow is primarily carried by elongated streams formed through the concatenation of dipoles. Vortices separate into two distinct families: small, fast-moving cores and larger, slowly moving ones that can be described as 'frozen' into a slowly evolving 'crystal'. The kinematics of these two families exhibit significant differences, with only the former displaying self-similarity. The latter family is responsible for the majority of the flow's kinetic energy, and its vortices form the dipoles and streams. The mechanisms driving the growth of this slow component are discussed."

The running time of quantum algorithms in this framework is often characterized by the quantum hitting time, which is the time required for the quantum walk to locate a vertex of interest with high probability. This article presents improved upper bounds for the quantum hitting time, applicable to several continuous-time quantum walk (CTQW)-based quantum algorithms. Notably, our techniques are applied to the glued-trees problem, yielding a polynomial improvement in the hitting time upper bound, from O(n^5) to O(n^2 log n). Additionally, our methods also enable an exponential improvement in the precision dependence of the continuous-time quantum walk-based algorithm for finding a marked node on any ergodic, reversible Markov chain, as proposed by Chakraborty et al."

Dry EMRIs, previously considered the primary EMRI sources for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, are primarily generated through multi-body scattering in the nuclear star cluster and gravitational capture. This letter highlights an alternative EMRI formation pathway: the formation of wet EMRIs facilitated by the accretion flow surrounding accreting massive black holes (MBHs) at galactic centers. In this scenario, the accretion disk captures stellar-mass black holes initially on inclined orbits, and subsequently drives their migration towards the MBH, thereby significantly boosting the EMRI formation rate in such galaxies by orders of magnitude."

Despite this, we expect our recommender systems to engage users from the outset, encouraging them to stay on the website and become active users. This challenge falls under the new user cold-start category, which is critical to a company's development and survival. Existing approaches to addressing user cold-start recommendation often require additional user effort, such as participating in an interview process, or rely on supplementary information, including user demographics, locations, and social relationships. However, users may be unwilling to participate in interviews, and such supplementary information is often unavailable for cold-start users."

Its applications in wireless communications have also yielded promising results, despite the existence of well-understood radio systems and optimal algorithms for various tasks. Although learning individual components of a receiver has led to some improvements, a more effective approach involves jointly learning the entire receiver. However, this often results in a complex nonlinear problem, for which the optimal solution is impractical to implement. To address this challenge, we propose a deep fully convolutional neural network, Deeprx, which processes the entire receiver pipeline from frequency domain signal streams to uncoded bits in a 5G-compliant manner. By carefully constructing the input of the convolutional neural network using both data and pilot symbols, we enable accurate channel estimation."
229,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"Mutation-based fuzzing typically utilizes an initial set of non-crashing seed inputs, known as a corpus, to generate new inputs through mutation. A corpus of potential seeds often comprises thousands of similar inputs, resulting in a lack of diversity that can lead to inefficient fuzzing efforts due to exhaustive mutation from all available seeds. To mitigate this issue, fuzzers are often equipped with distillation tools, such as afl-cmin, which select the smallest subset of seeds that trigger the same range of instrumentation data points as the full corpus. It is commonly believed that minimizing the number and cumulative size of the seeds leads to more efficient fuzzing, a notion that we systematically investigate. Our results, based on over 34 cpu-years of fuzzing with five distinct distillation approaches, provide insight into their impact on bug discovery in real-world software."

A scalable supervisor is designed for the case of partial observation, with a state size and computational cost that are independent of the number of agents. Notably, this supervisor does not require recomputation when agents are added to or removed from the system. We extend our previous results to partial observation by proposing sufficient conditions for safety and maximal permissiveness of the scalable least restrictive supervisor at the template level. An illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the proposed scalable supervisory synthesis approach."

A novel approach to ENF estimation is presented, leveraging temporal windowing based on the filter-bank Capon spectral estimator. By exploiting the Toeplitz structure of the model covariance matrix, a type of Gohberg-Semencul factorization is employed. Notably, this approach pioneers the use of a non-rectangular temporal window in the pre-spectral estimation stage within the ENF field. Krylov matrices facilitate efficient matrix inversions, enabling fast implementation. The proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art ENF estimation techniques when utilizing a 1-second time window in power recordings. Furthermore, it yields highly accurate results in speech recordings, striking a balance between time complexity and accuracy."

Additionally, regularized regression estimators based on these reduced dimension spaces are provided, encompassing classical principal component regression to sparse partial robust M regression. The package also includes a range of classical and robust pre-processing utilities, such as generalized spatial signs, along with specialized plotting functionality and cross-validation tools. Notably, direpack is designed to be compatible with the scikit-learn API, allowing its estimators to seamlessly integrate into statistical and machine learning pipelines within that framework."
233,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"The nonlinear fluorescence emission has been extensively utilized for high spatial resolution optical imaging. Here, we investigated the anomalous fluorescence saturation effect of nitrogen vacancy defects in diamond. High-power laser excitation led to a notable reduction in fluorescence, which increased the nonlinearity of the fluorescence emission and altered the spatial frequency distribution of the fluorescence image. To extract high spatial frequency information, we employed a differential excitation protocol. By modulating the excitation laser's power, we achieved an approximate 1.6-fold improvement in spatial resolution compared to confocal microscopy. Given the simplicity of the experimental setup and data processing, we anticipate that this method can be applied to enhance the spatial resolution of sensing and biological labeling using defects in solids."
234,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"When random effects are correlated with sample design variables, the conventional approach of using individual survey weights, constructed to be inversely proportional to the unit survey inclusion probabilities, to form a pseudo-likelihood no longer yields asymptotically unbiased inference. To address this, we develop a weight-exponentiated formulation for the random effects distribution, which enables unbiased inference for generating hyperparameters of the random effects. In contrast to frequentist methods that rely on numerical integration, our Bayesian approach uniquely achieves both unbiased estimation with respect to the sampling design distribution and consistency with respect to the population generating distribution. Through simulations and a real data example from a survey of business establishments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across various modeling formulations and sampling designs. This work represents a culmination of recent efforts to integrate traditional survey estimation approaches with the Bayesian modeling paradigm, bridging the gap between these two distinct yet rich sub-fields."

The reduced symmetries of these emerging materials lead to inhomogeneous responses in electrons, optics, valleys, and spins, as well as novel properties such as ferroelasticity, ferroelectricity, magnetism, spin-wave phenomena, large nonlinear optical properties, photogalvanic effects, and superconductivity. Furthermore, low symmetry enables novel electronic topological properties, nonlinear elastic properties, and structural phase transformations. The special topic ""Beyond Graphene: Low-Symmetry and Anisotropic 2D Materials"" was compiled to showcase recent experimental and theoretical research on these emerging materials."

Notably, this study revealed that, unlike low-molecular-weight mesogens, the relaxation of electric birefringence in a mesogenic polymer melt above the nematic-isotropic phase transition temperature can be described by a sum of multiple exponential processes, with two dominant processes playing a crucial role. These primary processes replace each other within a temperature range of approximately fifty degrees. Furthermore, dielectric spectroscopy enabled the identification of two distinct orientational relaxation processes: one attributed to the rotation of side mesogenic groups, and the other associated with the motion of main chain segments."

Optimizing discrete hash bits remains a primary focus in these methods. A prevalent strategy involves employing an activation function, such as sigmoid or tanh, and minimizing a quantization loss to approximate discrete values. However, this approach can lead to an increasing number of hash bits becoming stuck in the saturated area of the activation functions, never to escape. We refer to this issue as the ""dead bits problem"" (dbp). Furthermore, existing quantization losses can exacerbate dbp. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective gradient amplifier that acts prior to activation functions, thereby alleviating dbp."
238,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"We investigate the phenomenology of a hypercharge-zero SU(2) triplet scalar, motivated by two-step electroweak symmetry-breaking. We examine two scenarios: one where the triplets are stable and contribute to the dark matter density, and another where they decay through mixing with the Standard Model Higgs boson. The former scenario is constrained by disappearing charged track searches at the LHC and by dark matter direct detection experiments, whereas the latter is constrained by existing multilepton collider searches. Our findings indicate that a two-step electroweak phase transition involving a stable triplet with a negative quadratic term is ruled out by direct detection searches, while an unstable triplet with a mass below 230 GeV is excluded at a 95% confidence level."

The standard scenario assumes an initially circular and narrow belt of planetesimals at semi-major axis $a$, which undergoes an increase in eccentricity to $e_f$ after the gas disc has dispersed, due to secular perturbations from an eccentric planet, resulting in a belt of width $2ae_f$. A minor modification to this scenario suggests that narrower belts can form if the planetesimals are initially eccentric, potentially resulting from earlier planet perturbations during the gas-rich protoplanetary disc phase. Alternatively, a primordial eccentricity could be caused by instabilities that increase the disc eccentricity, eliminating the need for planetary involvement."

In one dimension (1D), the physics of interacting electrons is well-captured at low energies by the Tomonaga-Luttinger-Liquid (TLL) model; however, experimental observations beyond this linear regime have been scarce. Here, we present measurements of many-body modes in 1D gated wires using a tunnelling spectroscopy technique. Our findings reveal two distinct Fermi seas at high energies, associated with spin and charge excitations, as well as the emergence of three additional 1D 'replica' modes that intensify with decreasing wire length. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability to vary the effective interaction strength in the wires by modulating the amount of 1D inter-subband screening by over 45%."

By analyzing their dynamical properties, particularly in the space of integrals of motion, we identified clusters with a common origin.

To facilitate easy access to these novel estimators, the package provides high-level, intuitive functions built on a foundation of efficient, low-level routines. Intrinsic encompasses two categories of models: homogeneous and heterogeneous intrinsic dimension estimators.

In contrast, the heterogeneous category features hidalgo, a Bayesian mixture model, which is accompanied by an efficient Gibbs sampler implementation."

Our micromagnetic simulation results, which analyzed the nonlinear responses of MSM and STNO to current pulse stimulation, demonstrate that an RC system utilizing a single MSM achieves outstanding performance in handwritten digit recognition tasks. Furthermore, complex unknown nonlinear dynamic problems can be effectively solved by a physical RC system comprising 24 STNOs, as confirmed by its performance in a second-order nonlinear dynamic system and NARMA10 tasks."

This paper reveals a surprising consequence of popularity-based rankings: when fewer items convey a specific signal, they collectively attract a disproportionately higher share of overall traffic. This 'few-get-richer' phenomenon arises in settings with limited distinct classes of items, such as left-leaning versus right-leaning news sources, where items are ranked by popularity. We analytically demonstrate that this effect emerges when users tend to click on top-ranked items and exhibit heterogeneous preferences for item classes. Through simulations, we examine how the effect's strength varies with different assumptions about the setting and human behavior. We also experimentally validate our predictions in an online study with human participants, yielding findings with significant implications for understanding the dissemination of misinformation."

However, most pruning techniques involve trade-offs between model accuracy and regularity, leading to compromised inference accuracy and limited on-device acceleration capabilities. To address this issue, we propose a novel sparsity dimension, pattern-based sparsity, which combines pattern and connectivity sparsity to achieve both high accuracy and hardware friendliness. By carefully designing patterns, our pruning approach consistently achieves unprecedented accuracy enhancement and improved feature extraction capabilities across different DNN structures and datasets. Furthermore, our pattern-aware pruning framework enables simultaneous pattern library extraction, pattern selection, pattern and connectivity pruning, and weight training. Our approach, based on the new pattern-based sparsity, seamlessly integrates with compiler optimization, enabling highly efficient DNN execution on mobile platforms."

We examine the impact of mountaintop removal mining (mrm) on mortality using a difference-in-differences analysis that leverages the increase in mrm following the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments. For a difference-in-differences analysis of the effect of mrm on mortality, we constructed a more closely matched control group and obtained a 95% confidence interval that encompasses substantial adverse effects, as well as no effect and small beneficial effects."

Instead of investing in physical barriers, it would be more effective to allocate resources to programs that empower refugees to become self-sufficient. (applause) Although we often have to abandon our possessions, we retain our skills and knowledge. If permitted to lead productive lives, refugees can not only support themselves but also contribute to the development of their host countries.

These are the questions I always begin my poetry workshops with, as I believe they help students connect with the art form on a deeper level. At times, poetry can seem like a stagnant art form associated with older white men, as if they were born with a predetermined fate, like Benjamin Button. To help my students find their own voice, I ask them these questions and then share my own answers. I am the daughter of black writers, who are descended from freedom fighters who broke free from their chains and changed the world. They call me. I repeat these words as a mantra before every poetry performance, a ritual that helps me center myself. In fact, I was doing just that in the corner, preparing myself for this moment."

For about five years after graduating from a reputable liberal arts university, this was my day job. (laughter) I was a self-employed living statue, known as the eight-foot bride, and I love sharing this with people, because everyone always wonders, what's the real story behind these street performers. (laughter) Hello. I would paint myself white, stand on a box, place a hat or can at my feet, and when someone came by and dropped in money, I'd hand them a flower – along with some intense eye contact. And if they didn't take the flower, I'd add a gesture of sadness and longing as they walked away."
269,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,speech,"On October 4, 1957, the world witnessed a historic moment with a mix of awe and trepidation as the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the world's first artificial satellite, into space. This small metal sphere, measuring less than two feet in diameter, sparked a space race between the United States and the Soviet Union that would span eighteen years and forever alter the world as we knew it. Although Sputnik was not the first human-made object to enter space, it holds a significant place in history. The V-2 rocket, used by Germany in missile attacks against Allied cities during the final years of World War II, holds the distinction of being the first piece of human technology to reach space. Although the V-2 rocket was not particularly effective, both the United States and the Soviet Union captured the technology and the scientists behind it after the war, utilizing them for their own projects."

Please stand by for a message from the Secretary-General of the United Nations, António Guterres. The climate emergency is the defining crisis of our time. We are in a desperate race against time, and unfortunately, we are falling behind. A growing tide of impatience, particularly among young people, is rising in response to global inaction. We urgently need greater ambition from all stakeholders: governments, cities, businesses, investors, and individuals worldwide. I am pleased to see the launch of TED Countdown, as your influence and innovative ideas can help accelerate momentum towards a carbon-neutral world by 2050. This is the only way to mitigate the worst impacts of global heating. We possess the necessary tools, scientific knowledge, and resources. Now, let us summon the political will and energy to join this critical race."

But why is this the case? As I speak, over 800 million women worldwide are experiencing their period. Without it, none of us would exist, yet it remains a subject often deemed too embarrassing to openly discuss. From my own experiences and those of the women around me, I can attest that it's draining. It's draining to discreetly retrieve a pad from a brown paper bag, hastily stuffing it into your pocket during class, and then rushing to the washroom as unobtrusively as possible. It's equally exhausting to sit through lessons and meetings, pretending to be perfectly normal, while silently suffering from intense period cramps."

Spanning across northern Canada, including Labrador, it is home to the world's largest remaining wild caribou herd, the George River caribou herd, which numbers approximately 400,000 animals. Although I was unable to spot any during my visit, the antlers serve as proof of their presence. Throughout the boreal region, we are fortunate to have an incredible abundance of wetlands. Globally, wetlands are one of the most endangered ecosystems, yet they are crucial for cleaning the air and water, sequestering significant amounts of greenhouse gases, and supporting a vast array of species."

Four brothers, bound together by their shared isolation, wandered this celestial realm, their only family being each other, for they had no knowledge of their parents. One brother, Deminan, stood out from the rest, his skin marred by painful scabs that left him wondering why he alone bore this affliction. One day, while the supreme spirit Yaya tended to his gardens, Deminan and his brothers snuck into Yaya's house, where they indulged in a feast and explored the surroundings. Their curiosity eventually led them to a giant gourd hanging in the corner, but as they attempted to peer inside, it slipped from their grasp and fell."

Following graduation, I attended a career fair on campus, where I secured an interview with a start-up called Theranos. At the time, there was limited information available about the company, but what I found was truly impressive. Essentially, Theranos was developing a medical device that would enable individuals to run their entire blood panel using just a finger-stick of blood, eliminating the need for a large needle injection in the arm. This concept was intriguing not only because it was less painful, but also because it had the potential to open the door to predictive diagnostics."

There, we lived among the Inuit in a small community of 200 Inuit people, where we were one of only three non-Inuit families. In this community, we didn't have the luxury of modern conveniences like television, computers, or even a telephone. As a result, I spent most of my time outdoors with the Inuit, playing and learning. The snow and ice served as my playground, and the Inuit were my guides. It was there that I developed a deep fascination with the polar realm."

I have no control over who comes to us or the duration of their stay. We receive individuals for whom all other avenues have been exhausted, people who have slipped through the cracks of every other social safety net. Since they can't be contained elsewhere, it falls to us to do so. Our role is to contain and control them. Over the years, as a prison system, a nation, and a society, we've become adept at this task, but that's not something to be proud of. Currently, we have the highest incarceration rate per capita of any country in the world. Notably, there are more black men incarcerated today than there were enslaved in 1850."

Escorting and landing the probe on a comet has been my passion for the past two years. To set the stage, I need to explain the origin of our solar system. Going back 4.5 billion years, a vast cloud of gas and dust existed. At its center, our sun formed and ignited, and with it, the planets, comets, and asteroids we know today took shape. According to theory, after the Earth cooled down following its formation, comets collided with our planet, delivering water and likely complex organic materials that may have kick-started the emergence of life."

Today's discussion is particularly significant, one of the most substantial we've had. When we launched the 'Build Back Better' series, our goal was to explore ways to address the challenges arising from the pandemic and reimagine a path forward. However, the tragic events of the past week, including the devastating death of George Floyd and the subsequent daily protests, have introduced a new sense of urgency that we must acknowledge. Can we truly build back better from this? I believe that before we can even begin to answer that question, we must first strive to comprehend the magnitude of this moment.

President Theodore Roosevelt spent the night in a grove of towering sequoia trees, braved a snowstorm, and engaged in hours of conversation around the campfire with his host and guide, renowned conservationist John Muir. While Roosevelt was well-known for his love of the outdoors, Muir's invitation was motivated by more than just a desire for a camping trip: Yosemite was facing a grave threat. Although Yosemite had been designated as protected land in 1864, the valley remained vulnerable to overdevelopment in 1903, lying at the heart of a decades-long struggle to balance preservation and public use – a delicate balance that proved far easier to articulate than achieve. The battle to safeguard Yosemite's future had begun decades earlier, with the 1849 gold rush, which drew a surge of miners to the Sierra Nevada foothills in search of gold."

Unfortunately, that dream never took off. Simply put, I live in Gaza, where there is no airport, and all borders are closed on every side. We are essentially living in one of the world's largest prisons. The only thing I can do is gaze up at the sky. On some days, we're fortunate if we have electricity for four or five hours.

My journey began 14 years ago, when I was a young and ambitious reporter, fresh out of college. I stumbled upon a scoop that, although straightforward, had the potential to create significant impact. The story was about police officers accepting bribes from street vendors, a practice that was widely known but had yet to be exposed. Determined to make a difference, I decided to take an unconventional approach. I went undercover, posing as a vendor, and was able to gather concrete evidence of the corruption. The impact was substantial, and it was a prime example of what is often referred to as immersion or undercover journalism."

A new drug can prolong the lives of patients with a rare disease. Such health headlines are published daily, often presenting conflicting claims. However, there can be a disconnect between attention-grabbing headlines and the specific, incremental results of the medical research they cover. To avoid being misled by sensational headlines, it's essential to examine the original research they report on. We've created hypothetical research scenarios for each of these three headlines. Continue watching for an explanation of the first example, then pause at the headline to answer the question. These scenarios are simplified for clarity."

But then my mom explained, ""Kristen, neither of your brothers has a birth certificate, so how do you suggest we determine their birthdates?"" I was taken aback. Twenty years later, I'm still working on this issue, but instead of trying to solve the mystery of my brothers' missing birth certificates, I'm tackling the problem on a global scale. So, what's the connection between birth certificates and international development?"

If given the choice, would you opt for such an existence? This is the question philosopher Robert Nozick posed through his thought-provoking experiment, known as the Experience Machine. The experiment invites us to consider a world where scientists have developed a machine capable of simulating real life, guaranteeing experiences of pure pleasure and eliminating pain entirely. The trade-off, however, is that you must permanently relinquish reality, although the simulated experiences would be virtually indistinguishable from the real thing. Life's natural ebbs and flows would be replaced with an endless succession of highs. At first glance, this may seem like an attractive proposition."

This incident occurred a couple of years ago. I was consulted to see a woman in her 70s, a retired English professor, who was battling pancreatic cancer. She was experiencing pain, nausea, and vomiting, which prompted the request for my expertise. During our consultation, we discussed her symptoms, and she inquired about the potential benefits of medical marijuana.

This decision was driven by the realization that the next major threat facing not only my city, but also cities across the country, was not the typical one-and-done disaster, where firefighters could simply respond, put out the fire, and leave feeling like they had made a difference, with everything back to normal."
288,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,speech,"Where does all the carbon we release go? Carbon operates within a natural cycle, present in all living organisms: in the soil, oceans, atmosphere, and deep underground rocks. When plants and other living organisms die, a significant portion of their stored carbon is released back into the atmosphere, only to be reabsorbed by new plant growth. However, over millions of years, some of the carbon stored in ancient trees and sea life is transformed into rock and fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas. Natural events, like volcanic eruptions, release some of the carbon trapped in rock, while human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, also release prehistoric carbon. Today, human activities release approximately 60 times more carbon than all the volcanoes on the planet combined each year."
289,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,speech,"Even nature's most reviled creatures hold important secrets, but who would want a swarm of cockroaches approaching them? Yet, one of the greatest differences between natural and human technologies lies in robustness. Robust systems remain stable in complex and unfamiliar environments. Notably, cockroaches can self-stabilize while running over rough terrain. When we equipped them with a jet pack or subjected them to a perturbation like an earthquake, we found that their remarkably tuned legs allowed them to self-stabilize without expending any brainpower. They can navigate complex terrain, such as grass, with ease and without becoming destabilized. We also discovered a new behavior, where, due to their shape, they automatically roll onto their side to pass through a simulated grass environment. Robust systems can perform multiple tasks using the same structure, and we have discovered another example of this behavior."

I'm referring to organized crime. While it's true that organized crime has a long history, its expansion over the last two decades has been unprecedented, now accounting for approximately 15 percent of the world's GDP.

Sperm donors are often referred to as ""biological fathers,"" but is it accurate to use the term ""father"" in this context? As a philosopher and social scientist, I have been studying these questions surrounding the concept of parenthood.
