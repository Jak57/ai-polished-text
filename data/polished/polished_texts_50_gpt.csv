1,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Another week flew by. I drove by the new house yesterday, and the front window was covered in boxes. We may get the keys at closing, and I am getting so excited. If all goes well this week, we will be set for closing a week from Wednesday. I was up until after 3:00 a.m. last night watching movies with Bethany. There has been a lot of movie-watching happening here lately. Here's my rundown: last night we watched ""Thirteen,"" a movie every mother of a teen should see. It was better than I expected. Then we watched ""Gigli,"" and, yes, it was just as bad as the media said, but we had to watch it ourselves."
2,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Summer TV used to be a dead zone full of repeats. However, now there are two great new shows I have been watching religiously for the last week. ""Blow Out"" has the gayest concept ever, seemingly with zero gay people in sight. Hairstylist Jonathan Antin wants to build a second location for his incredibly popular West Hollywood salon, now in Beverly Hills. Normally, no one would care—not me, but as I was flipping through the channels, I caught a glimpse of Jonathan, equally narcissistic and dull, looking at an empty space on Rodeo Drive. He declared, ""I am going to build here the greatest salon in the history of the world ever!"" and I was hooked. Not since ""Rocco"" have I found such a compelling TV moron."
3,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"What a week... My right shoulder has tendonitis, right under my shoulder blade. When I move my arm too much, especially with a mouse on a computer, it really hurts. I can’t move it much now because I was busy updating my website and working on other online tasks. I can barely draw anything. Lack of sleep worsens my pain. I'm not too happy right now, but I'll get better. My mom's surgery went okay. Her eyesight has somewhat returned; she can see fuzzy shapes and make out colors. Other than that, she's still nearly blind. Hopefully, she'll fully regain her vision soon."
4,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Encountering the kindness of strangers... Attempted laundry today with the kids in tow and realized how quickly the simplest things can become an ordeal. I also learned how remarkably sweet strangers can be for no reason other than wanting to be kind. Trust me—it wasn't like they were hoping to impress me or anything. I was covered in kid drool and wearing my 'wash-day' outfit... Also, I'm not entirely sure when I'll be bathing again, so there was no olfactory incentive! I am currently doing two things: composing a post and watching collected No Doubt videos. Both of these things I am doing while sitting at my desk in my room."
5,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"So it is 11:14 PM MST, and here I sit in my bedroom fixing the personal computer of the personnel director from my job. Not that I mind, but I wonder sometimes how often I find myself fixing someone else's computer as a favor. I'm glad to help in this way, but where is the line drawn between kindness and being taken advantage of? The last couple of weeks, I've been staying up late, so I was looking forward to sleeping early until I realized it was best to get this computer back to its owner. No rest for the weary, right? I found myself watching Joe Schmo 2 again tonight."
6,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Remind me, what did I write about before this? A continuation in the ""Is this a date?"" saga. So, after the weird lunch, my confidence shook. I forgot to share an important piece of the story. Before Pat arrives for lunch, Dustin begins talking about what a nice guy Pat is and how he's trying to find a girlfriend for him. I'm listening, nodding, and realizing that we're talking more about finding Dustin's best friend a girl than discussing whatever you discuss with a stranger over pink lemonade. I excused myself to the bathroom, looked in the mirror, and silently asked myself: am I being pawned off to the other guy? Is this what happens now?"
7,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"I would like everyone to think before they act. Actually, I wish each and every person in the world would think before getting out of bed in the morning and make a commitment to keep thinking all day. If they aren't prepared to, I'd strongly prefer that they hop back in bed and drift off to an eternal slumber. I'm tired of dealing with stupid people. I'm not the smartest person in the world, and I'm not talking about things that require much brainpower, so I feel it's fair to criticize the profoundly ignorant. Let's see if I can limit this rant to a few specific types and save some for another day. Sound good? Great."
8,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Two problems with the scenario outlined in my previous post: 1. Although Bush is stimulating the economy, he is doing so ineffectively. Robert Rubin informed NPR's Marketplace today that Bush could have achieved the same stimulus effect without the long-term debt hangover by implementing different tax cuts—temporary cuts benefiting low and middle-income individuals. Ah, Robert Rubin. The mere mention of his name is music to our ears. Quick: name a Bush administration cabinet official on the domestic side with Rubin's gravitas. Still thinking? It'll come to you... 2. We cannot give Republicans control only in wartime because they've ingeniously concocted an endless, global 'war on terrorism.'"
9,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"'She's saying I'm on the run, I'm chasing guys for fun' ~The Offspring. I haven’t updated in a while because there’s not much to report. Went to the Cove to see Supernothing; they were good as usual. Got to chill with Tiago. On Saturday, I worked and then went out with Joe and Rach. Met up with Steve, Tiago, and Tom. Came home around 11:45 PM and woke up at 6:45 AM for a meet. I got there a little late, but it went well. I didn’t fall on floor, placed second on floor and vault, third on beam, and scored 29.45 overall, which is decent since my meets improve as the season progresses."
10,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Do you ever have one of those moments when you begin to reflect on life? Like you're sitting in math class, bored out of your skull, and you wonder what exactly goes on in your brain that makes you understand math? You realize you exist, you're in math class, and you wonder why. Then it hits you—the fact that you're off on this random train of thought feels incredibly pathetic. Ever had that happen? I hate that. You know what else I hate? Block schedules. Who would ever come up with that idea? Anyone can see sitting through a two-and-a-half-hour class in any subject is cruel and unusual punishment."
11,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"I think Monopoly has run its course in my life, and I vow never to lay my hands on that iron (not a hot one, but the piece in the game) again. Tonight, Andy beat me by a few small dollars and won the game, or maybe I let him win because he’s leaving in a few short hours, and I wanted him to feel good on his last night here. However the story goes, it can't compare to this Texas-sized headache I have at the moment. I've taken some Aleve, and I must say that they are doing the trick. All I need now is some well-deserved rest and relaxation; your telephone's the one that helped me wrap the cord around your neck... At the drive-in."
12,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Well... Today's been a long day. We drove home from Indiana. I guess I'll have to be selective about what I write because I could take up a lot of time and space, and I just don't have the energy. First off, I have to say that camp was awesome and even better than I could have expected. God has been doing so much in my life lately, and it's just amazing. I've turned over a new leaf, I guess, but back to the beginning. We arrived at the Twiggs' house on Friday evening and stayed until we left for camp on Monday. Most of our time was spent going to the fair, church, a parade, Walmart, and watching movies."
13,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Today is my last day of summer vacation! Ugh! And I have a dentist appointment at 9. I hate that, but I'd rather get it over with than try to schedule it during the first month of my surgery rotation. I'm definitely nervous, scared, jittery, and anything else you can think of for not wanting to go to school. This is going to be a whole new ball game for me. As a perfectionist, I love excelling at everything I do. But starting new things is tough. I hate being a pawn (like I told Cassie: ""I'm going to be the only pawn on the chessboard who insists on moving like a knight""), and I hate not knowing what's going on."
14,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Arun Shourie discusses how the current governor of Uttar Pradesh had warned as early as 1996 about the potential threat of a ""third Islamic state"" emerging in the subcontinent. T.V. Rajeswar, the former head of the Intelligence Bureau and the current governor of Uttar Pradesh, predicted this serious threat in a series of articles published in the Hindustan Times in 1996. Shourie makes a compelling argument by asking if acknowledging that Rajeswar, not Advani, authored these warnings lends them credibility, or if it leads to the conclusion that Rajeswar is a covert communalist who should not serve as governor."
15,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Attitude: bored; mood: indifferent, but looking forward to tonight. It's been a long, hard day in the trenches here today, folks, leaving almost no time to write for you readers. However, it's good to see Tigger (now Akcron) taking up the reins herself, making an appearance and discussing things. Yesterday was Shakespeare on the Green—a lovely play—but I had to leave before the closing curtain, which was disappointing. Hopefully, someday I'll see an entire Shakespeare play. But I digress. Akcron is right about the shower issues; it’s frustrating. In terms of laughing at her in the shower, you have to admit, the look people get when committing self-torture can be pretty entertaining."
16,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Suddenly, for the past two days, I have been overwhelmed with intense exhaustion. Bone-deep exhaustion. Last evening, I went home and slept, only waking when my mother called around eight-thirty. When I awoke, it was dark, and I hadn’t turned on the lights, so for a few seconds, I couldn't determine the time or date; it was just my mother’s voice in the darkness as I grappled with reality. I wonder why I’m feeling so drained... The weather is nice this morning. It was drizzling when I arrived. Although in Calcutta, I hear it’s been raining for the past three days."
17,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Last night was the worst. I threw away the sweater I was knitting. I only had about 14 inches. I lost probably $10 worth of yarn (it's $8 a skein). It had too many stitches by the time I reached the armholes, and the mohair was knotting itself together as I knitted, so frogging (ripping out rows) didn’t work well. The yarn broke a lot. I didn’t even swear, which is unusual for me. I just morosely unraveled it and listened to season two of Sex and the City (way to go, library!). Then I got sick of it and threw it away. I suppose I could say I learned a lot while attempting this sweater."
18,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Last night in class, we discussed this week's assigned reading, ""Getting Back into Place: Toward a Renewed Study of the Place-World"" by Edward S. Casey. The first chapter covers “implacement” and the second, “displacement.” In the first chapter, Casey argues that our contemporary world and culture revolve around time as the situating force: we are running out of time, we have saved time, we are just in time. He suggests that using place as the center of culture provides a more grounded community. (This is a very rough summation, provided as a disclaimer in case my professor or any other classmate reads this post.) So far, this book is the first reading that has grabbed me by the proverbial shoulders."
19,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Whatever they put into freeze pops to achieve those colors, there should be some sort of warning: may make your life a bit bizarre. While giggling is good, one wonders if we would have found ourselves up that fire escape drinking beer in the fierce wind had we not been eating them earlier. Finding ourselves in a doorway to a bar sadly closed for business, we stopped to examine an office-supplies catalog that had arrived in the mail. Lucky we did. Who could possibly have guessed that within these pages were the special offers of a lifetime? Not I, for certain. I list but a few: buy 36 permanent marker pens, get a stunt kite. Buy 30 lever arch files, get a barbecue."
20,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Currently listening to: ""The Little Drummer Boy"" by Stevan Pasero. And now, my post… Senate Republicans: okay, hands up—who watched the 39-hour judicial nominations spectacle last week? I know I didn't. Well, okay—I did tune in once or twice. The entire colossal waste of time was orchestrated by Republicans who, upset that Democrats wouldn't approve four of Bush's more extreme justices, were trying to score political points with a multi-day display. Never mind that Democrats have already approved 168 of Bush's judicial nominees—no, that's not enough for the power-hungry Republicans, who, for some reason, believe they have a huge mandate for this kind of nonsense."
21,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"This was a good weekend. I enjoyed a lot of nature, and after a long time, I listened to a lot of Nevermore (something I should have started doing much earlier) and read extensively. I finished three books over the weekend: Bruce Sterling's *Heavy Weather*, Larry Niven's *World of Ptavvs*, and Octavia Butler's *Parable of the Sower*. *Heavy Weather* was an engaging cyberpunk adventure set in a near-future USA devastated by global warming and widespread anarchy. While it was clever, well-paced, and altogether convincing, I must confess that I didn't come away with any truly significant sensations about the story or the characters. Though both are well constructed and vividly depicted—it's a good book, but not a great one, I guess."
22,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"The aftermath of the first week back from practicum was a struggle, but it was only in the second week that clarity began to emerge. Post-practicum trauma is a hidden issue now coming to light. I found relief after meeting with the course coordinator, which helped me prevent another from enduring a similarly deficient practicum. Yesterday, I encountered a distressed classmate who was eager to warn the next student about her poor practicum experience. I calmed her and suggested we approach the administrator first."
23,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Well, things get incredibly busy here at times...but there's always time for stress-relieving activities. I've found that I really struggle with 8-ball and ping pong! Rick (the Canuck) often beats me regularly - we have a ping pong table in the front lobby of our building, so there's always time for a quick round. Last night, I participated in an 8-ball tournament at the hot spot (our recreation tent complete with a popcorn machine, numerous TVs, jukebox, DVD rental, pool table, dart board, and ever-present ping pong table). Anyway, I was doing pretty well throughout my one entire game - until I scratched on the eight ball. I still had a good time - the most fun was with the two Dutch soldiers who joined in the tournament."
24,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Fall 1974: I was attempting for what felt like the 13th time to fight my way through the second chapter of my high school algebra book. I was not then nor am I now a math person. I hate math. I am math phobic. You get the picture. As I struggled to make sense of algebra, the doorbell rang. I put down my book and went to open the door. No one was there. Great. I returned to my studies and, just as I was finding a little glimmer of understanding buried in my subconscious, the doorbell rang again. Bam, just like that, my breakthrough disappeared. I went to the door, and once again, no one was there. Just what a struggling math student needs—an uninvited practical joker."
25,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"This past week has been nothing short of exhausting. I spent Tuesday to Thursday finishing the move to my new classroom, which is bigger and closer to my grade-level team. These are important factors to consider as I spend hours preparing my room for this year. Had I known I was going to move before the end of the school year, I would have discarded many books and supplies I no longer use. Unfortunately, it all came with me. So, this week was spent moving, unpacking, and purging profusely. I have to thank my teammate Jill for helping with all of this. She was still teaching this month in my old room, so she and her lovely students moved almost my entire room for me!"

Even if I never carried your child, even if I was never married to you, even if I was never an official pair to you... I loved you immensely, and to this day the feeling echoes through my heart. I will always be reminded of those few nights we spent together, hearts and limbs entwined in a soul-embrace, drenched in the salty darkness of an evening by the beach... Or a kiss under the rain. Whenever I feel a dark glass puncturing my heart, you will be there. That piece of you... Bleeding the eternal love that once lived in me... And still remains."
27,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"I'm uneasy. Investigative reporting feels very wrong to me. Or let me rephrase that, the article I'm working on and its consequences are not exactly something I'm comfortable with. Perhaps it is because I don't believe in it enough to fully engage. The angst behind it. The full-out passion to question. I've grown up in a country where you don't ask questions. Really, you just don't. They punish you for that. They imprison you under internal security acts. I'm not used to this freedom of speech...not used to questioning out loud. Sure, I am not the easiest person to get along with."
28,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"We had an outing yesterday with my coworkers from the bank. We went to Guintubdan, La Carlota. It was the first visit for most of us. We trekked to the falls, a 30-minute walk. We were all out of breath, but we made it. The water was icy cold, numbing our bodies. We stayed for less than an hour before heading to the nearby waterfalls, another 30-minute trek. The trip was worth it, as the falls were calming, and the entire scene was breathtaking. It felt like becoming one with nature. Soaking in the cold water was like communing with Mother Earth. The cold air and water lulled us into tranquility."

It’s something I didn’t inherit from the Buenviajes—the desire to drink. There are a few occasions when I don't mind drinking, but they are rare. We have a month left before Ed leaves, and it’s starting to sink in for all of us. It hit me a long time ago. I hope Ed will be here for Bailey's surgery. We've been monitoring his swelling, which is quite visible."

Thankfully, I brought a bag of eggs just in case. Connor had a great time finding eggs in the park. On Sunday morning, he was thrilled that the Easter Bunny had come. There's nothing better than seeing the excitement on your child's face. After egg hunting, we all went to church. Even though the ""Easter Bunny"" is fun, we make sure our kids know the true meaning of the holidays. This was Megan's first Easter, and she looked so cute in her jean dress and stockings."

I somehow managed to get a flat tire. Luckily, I'm at work, so the guys are going to inflate it for me and ensure it holds air. If not, they're going to change my tire and put the spare on. Thankfully, my spare is full-sized. I may get to buy a new tire tonight, woohoo! Hamad Tire, here I come! I thought I had found another VW."

Parents think they know everything about us, maybe even to the point where they believe they can read our emotions just by looking at our faces. But they can't. They actually know very little about us. And after I finish arguing with Nicole about Kelli, like I just did a few minutes ago, they expect me to tell them what's wrong. Honestly, sometimes I just want to tell them to back off. I don't need to share my problems all the time. Here's the situation with Nicole and Kelli: they don't like each other. At all."

Fortunately, I skillfully maneuvered my car from the far left lane to the far right and got onto Route 50. All of this means little unless you're familiar with the area. Yesterday, Sara decided to Google me and, to my surprise, discovered that my email to Ivan Meisel on ESPN.com was published online!

Yes, that's right—I saw it on the opening day! (Thanks, Mike, for the ticket.) Daniel Radcliffe, aka Harry Potter, has grown up so fast, and he is so cute! Malfoy too, haha. Well, the movie was great. I give it 4 1/2 stars because they left out important details! Overall, the movie was good. I didn't really dress up for the movie, but I was wearing a Ravenclaw tie even though I like Gryffindors better. I might go see the movie again in two weeks."

I have firm pears this time, and my own jar of peanut butter to dip the pears into, but it is still crunchy, not smooth, and I definitely think it makes a difference. I am also slightly perturbed as I thought this was a healthy snack and just noticed that per fifth of a jar (and our jars are much smaller) per 100g there are 614 calories! Don’t dwell on it. I have just returned from an evening out at my old music teacher/friend's house. Yes, I know... I missed her for that—but I did tape it!

With this dot: a baker's dozen of Congressional Democrats, including four New Yorkers, have petitioned U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to send international observers to Florida for this year's presidential balloting. I humbly disagree. Based on the information available, the OSCE seems to be coming here to learn from the U.S. election process, not to oversee it, contrary to the original partisan and immature call for U.N. intervention."

The citizenship ceremony there seemed routine, with nearly 200 people becoming new Americans. Before leaving the June 29 event, an immigration official encouraged attendees to visit a voter registration table—a common feature at such ceremonies. However, this table was unusual: Republican volunteers were handing out forms with the party affiliation box pre-checked to enroll new voters as GOP members. Linda Cross found it suspicious while witnessing her husband, Dario Cruz, take his citizenship oath."

Nothing like 48 hours of daydreaming to recharge one's creative energy. I have it good for a foreigner, and my timing was good, too. The illustration part is the icing on the cake. I'd probably complain more if that didn't fall in my lap. I'm not blind to the fact that I'm getting ripped off. Getting hungry.

44,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"I liked the idea of that as an offense—perhaps a way to avoid being burned as a witch. As a non-American blogger, I've been a bit hesitant to engage in some of these discussions, especially about flags. However, since I initiated the subject (not the flag-burning), I suppose I should comment. Firstly, I believe that having a law against flag-burning is completely absurd. The moment a symbol of any kind receives automatic reverence and protection, you've taken a small but significant step toward totalitarianism. Symbols are inherently changeable—they don't inherently represent anything; it’s all about the perceptions or meanings attributed to them."

However, too much energy was spent on the set (which was magnificent) and not enough on creating a solid tone and theme. It retold the story, but was not particularly gripping, and I didn't feel like I gained anything from watching it. The character development was rather weak. Additionally, I thought the score was poor, essentially a knock-off of Gladiator. Gladiator used the background music of a moaning woman effectively because it complemented a genuinely gripping narrative."

A standout feature is that each post acts as a separate entity, allowing users to move, store, label, and delete them. This capability is likely to please news trackers.

The emergency tariff filing by the California ISO last Friday has adversely impacted the PX Day Ahead Auction market. The combination of soft and hard caps leads to a disconnect and poses unacceptable risks to all participants. This will likely not achieve the ISO's desired reduction in real-time energy sales and procurement. Consequently, supply will still defer to the higher price opportunities offered by the ISO. The PX is petitioning Terry Winter of the ISO to immediately allow for adjustment bids on any submitted schedule at any relevant price."

If Grays Harbor Paper notifies RT of a unit derate or outage, RT should notify BPA dispatch immediately and adjust the schedule during the next ramp.

The order provides for $69 million in potential refunds, requiring either repayment or cost justification. Enron was not named as one of the 13 overcharging parties, but PGE was ($3.18 million). It's not over yet, though. The order only addresses January 2001 and indicates further orders concerning December 2000 and benchmark prices through April 2001. The prices used to determine refunds were fairly high ($273/MWh based on gas prices, emissions costs, and an assumed heat rate of over 16,000). Regarding sales to California, we have concluded at least one short-term sale and have discussed longer-term deals with the California Department of Water Resources, but we were still struggling with credit issues."

Absolutely amazing, have nothing negative to say about this game as it's exceeded my expectations and will probably exceed yours too. Fluid movement, bug/crash free, lots of story/content to put you through, options every day such as multiple practices, events (sponsorships) and even games. This review is purely based on playing mycareer, and so far it's 10/10. Facescan worked really well for me (used it two times, first one gave me a different look though..).

97,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Magic fans, beware... Wizards is hesitant to create a quality digital game. At its core, Magic: The Gathering is a social experience. It’s a game to enjoy with friends (or frenemies), filled with laughter, friendly banter, and thrilling victories. Wizards of the Coast seems to have lost sight of this. Playing with friends doesn't earn you gold, which is crucial in the game. Gold's importance is underscored by the daily cap, understandable since it unlocks everything. Prepare for a lengthy and dull 1v1 grind against the computer or random opponents, with whom you can't interact. Playing for free demands roughly four hours daily for a month, alone, to unlock the cards."
98,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Being the third installment in the trilogy, I'll address the negative aspects first. I quite dislike prequels as they technically move backwards in a story rather than forwards, which is an issue for every prequel. Granted, they offer more story-wise. The combat feels sloppy and doesn't match the sharpness Arkham City achieved. As of this writing (26/10/2013), there's a game-breaking bug that prevents a side mission from being completed (main story unaffected). Some gadgets have a ridiculous hotkey, requiring your hand to travel across the keyboard to access them. It might sound minor, but during combat, this could potentially disrupt your combo."
99,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"They have improved Shadow Warrior (2013): the boss fights are thrilling, and the weapons feel satisfying (perhaps not as great as those in Doom, but still impressive). Enemies aren't overly durable, provided you manage elemental effects and upgrades wisely. The upgrade system is balanced, and once you understand it, doesn't become tedious. The elemental effects and limited ammo encourage using various weapons. There's a variety of cool, unique weapons that remain effective throughout the game. The music is excellent, particularly the main theme and, of course, Stan Bush's contributions."
100,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"So many things were done wrong. I don't even know how to start this review. This all refers to MyCareer. My player is an outside scorer, PG, 1.71m, with maxed stats and all necessary perks. Ok, and now tell me, why does shooting skill depend on a person's height? Why can't someone who is 1.74m become as good at shooting as someone who is 1.71m? I'm 1.87m in real life, made my first player with this height, and noticed I can't reach a higher skill than 89. Why? That's pure discrimination! And why doesn't the game tell me that before I create a character, or even when I reach the skill limit after weeks of playing?!"
101,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"I think this Assassin's Creed nailed the mechanics on all fronts (ship battles, sailing, hunting, parkour, etc.). I felt much more attached to this character as well. The story starts out extremely rough but improves significantly as you play (I think this is true of every AC game personally). Edward was quite an interesting character, as were all the side characters. I felt like all the collectibles actually meant something in this AC game that I never got from the previous ones. They definitely were not required, but they were fun to collect, and you were rewarded in a very balanced way."
102,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"While I personally cannot recommend this game, it wasn't absolutely terrible. The gunplay is decent, as long as you have the money to purchase gun parts, which constitutes my main complaint: it's pay-to-win. If I could get past that, the game would be enjoyable, as the hardsuit is fun and HRV is an excellent idea. I'd choose this game over any Call of Duty title any day, but its pay-to-win microtransaction format is off-putting for me. If you are comfortable with this model, then by all means, have fun. But if you're like me and dislike pay-to-win games, just let this one slide; it's not our cup of tea."
103,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Though not flawless, this game has been immensely enjoyable. The save system and potential for sudden death can be frustrating. During my first playthrough, I lost my main character around hour 10 of a 20-hour session. I wished I could reload a save at that point. I've since used a third-party mod/save tool to prevent catastrophic failures. Additionally, the aiming reticle is small, and the zoom is weak. Despite these issues, it's been a blast. I'm not typically a zombie fan, but the mix of strategy, missions, and first-person shooter/beat-em-up elements is fantastic. I've been playing as often as possible... Just one more mission, just one more supply run—or I'm escaping to a safe spot before closing the game."
104,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"An absolutely great strategy game! Having played every other wargame (European Escalation and ALB), I must say this one fits well. The number of units is impressive—though I'm not sure exactly how many, there are a ton! The graphics are beautiful, the sounds are great, and the gameplay is epic. The in-game chat box at the main menu is entertaining as well—I'm not kidding. However, if you're new to the strategy genre, it might take some time to master. Don't get upset; you will lose units. Just plan ahead and always have anti-air and anti-tank."
105,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"I was negatively biased towards this game before I played it. I wasn’t even sure about buying it. I don’t know, the whole portal gun and portals thing seemed weird to me even though I like science fiction. Boy, was I wrong. The jokes and voice acting are phenomenal—just amazing. It’s not cheesy (okay, it’s sometimes cheesy). Different story characters each have their own sense of humor. Those characters truly have different personalities. And the level design; it's just rad. By the way, I never played the first Portal game. One of these days, I’m planning to if I can spare the time. I would never have played it if I hadn’t played the sequel."
106,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Let's start with the pros and cons, followed by my thoughts on the game. + Some of the best characters + Good story + Lots of content + Customizable character (you can be male or female) + You can have a relationship with most of your companions (yes, fangirls, you can have a love interest) - Bad graphics (I don't think graphics really matter anyway) - Awkward love scenes - Invisible walls - There's one mission that, in my opinion, was boring, but everyone has different tastes -+ This isn't really bad or good, but for those who care, your protagonist can't talk. Now for my thoughts: I love this game. It is probably one of the best RPGs or games in general I have ever played. If you're an RPG fan, you probably already have this game."
107,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Yes, this is a nostalgia trip for thirty-somethings who remember (at least in the UK) watching the ever-irritating Timmy Mallet just for the five-minute Transformers cartoon. The voice actors for Optimus, Megatron, Bumblebee, and many others are back and instantly recognizable. The distinctive cartoon transformation sound is present. Graphically, the cel-shaded presentation is perfect, and very, very Generation One. But aside from that, it's actually a very fun game. The combat mechanics are exceptionally well executed. Transforming mid-fight is often necessary and seamlessly integrated into combos, making it quite different from High Moon's excellent War for/Fall of Cybertron games. Another distinction is the heavy focus on melee combat, but some enemies (e.g., Seekers) require a switch to a ranged blaster."
108,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"I downloaded the game and played for a while, but it was nothing special. I spent more time trying to log in than actually playing. There's a bug where it says there's an update to the terms of service, and when you click 'accept,' it just pops up again. You have to restart the client for it to work. Why do I need to link my Steam and Gface accounts? They say it's for DLC, but why is that necessary? It's also irreversible, so now a company I don't care about has access to my Steam information. The game itself is mediocre. It's recognizable as a COD clone, except somehow they made the gunplay worse."
109,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"4K+ at 60fps (GTX 970), dual audio options, and includes Neptune gear. What's not to love? Excellent port and a great entry point if new to the series. Just keep in mind there is lots of (skippable) talking. As usual, I would suggest using a gamepad, but I had no problems with key/mouse setup, both completely rebindable. Price is about right and wouldn't have been unhappy about a purchase. More than half the DLC is included free, which is still plenty to play with. Recommended game to all JRPG/anime/visual novel fans, provided you don't mind long breaks between the action. Cheers."
110,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"I experienced no performance problems even at release, and after all these patches, it plays extremely well. In my opinion, this is a great and fun game, although the format can be somewhat irritating, with the free-roam city area repopulating with new enemies every time you progress the story. I particularly enjoyed the 'dual play' segments where you can play as Batman and another character. The ability to use the controller for most parts of the game, but switch to mouse and keyboard for the tank combat segments, was greatly appreciated. Driving the Batmobile around the free-roam city, especially when chasing the APC commanders, is quite enjoyable once you master skidding around corners. When you master that, driving around the city becomes a real pleasure!"
111,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"An excellent AAA FPS shooter—that’s the bottom line. It looks, sounds, and plays superbly with outstanding FPS mechanics, an engaging story, cool characters, impeccable voice acting, and a fantastic soundtrack. However, it’s not for the faint-hearted—some cutscenes are quite intense. But when a game is so great overall, its flaws become more apparent, and here are the ones I noticed: - No SLI support—I had to shelve the game until I upgraded my card, as it ran poorly on my old dual GPU GTX 590. Ensure you have a fairly decent single GPU card. - Frustratingly small obstacles are often unclimbable."
112,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"English is not my native language. I am Dutch, so please excuse any typing or grammatical mistakes in my review of this fantastic game. I will break down this review into a few categories: graphics, controls, sound, gameplay, and replayability. Graphics: The game is set in a comic-like style, with slick visuals and no unnecessary details. The color schemes are nice and effective for this game. The graphics can be set on 'high' without stressing your system. I run this game on an i5 Pentium processor with an NVIDIA GeForce 710m card and 8GB memory, and it operates smoothly on Windows 8.1. Controls: The game can be played with a keyboard and mouse or with an Xbox controller."
113,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"You can see by the hours I put into this game that I enjoy it. This is everything I wished a search game from COD would be. But don't buy this game thinking it's like COD, Battlefield, or any other shooter. It's in a class of its own and should be treated as such. Can't tell you how many times I hear new players complain about getting killed quickly. It's not like that doesn't happen in real life or anything. Edit: I've been playing this game for awhile now and thrown all kinds of money at it. One of the best multiplayer games around. A good choice when you're not feeling CS:GO."
114,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"I'm two hours in and thoroughly enjoying this game. It's hilarious. The gameplay is solid, the art design is beautiful, and the music is surprisingly high quality and fitting. The story and world keep me interested, and the puzzles are fun. However, the standout feature is the comedy. If you've played RPGs since their inception, you'll enjoy the jokes, parodies, and references. Even if you're new to RPGs, the humor is entertaining. If you've played Final Fantasy 7 or X, you must try this game. I had to pause after two hours because I was laughing and smiling so much. What a delight so far!"
115,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"I'm really sorry. I try to be supportive of free-to-play games and indie developers, but I really didn't enjoy this game. The description sounded perfect for me, but the execution did nothing for me. I love puzzle and exploration games, but I found this one completely unintuitive. Even after looking up how to progress, I simply didn’t find the gameplay fun. It also lacks a pause button, or if it does, I never found it. Considering that many sequences in the game are timed, this seems like a critical oversight. I also feel like this game is more cut scene than it is game, and I end up just sitting around drumming my fingers a lot."
116,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"This game... Phew, where do I even begin? It was breathtaking, from the story to the graphics; I was completely captivated. The narrative wasn't just a tale; it genuinely made me feel like I was that character, trying to uncover what came next in their journey. The gameplay was outstanding, and I discovered a lot about myself, particularly my fear of heights, which was never an issue until the ice caverns. My stomach churned throughout, but I persevered for Uncle Fred! If you created a DLC or a sequel, I would be the first to purchase it and recommend it to everyone I know. Thanks to everyone involved in creating this; you made an absolutely beautiful game."
117,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth is a turn-based game where you build your civilization to achieve a specific goal or ""victory."" Previously, the series focused on Earth's timeline, progressing through periods like the Stone Age, Medieval Age, and Modern Age. In contrast, this game is set in the future, centered on colonizing a new planet. I enjoy how 2K adopted a fresh approach by introducing new mechanics such as the affinity system and orbital layer. However, these innovations can make the game feel overwhelming at times. I believe the game could be improved by incorporating new artwork, especially regarding the environment you experience during interactions with other leaders."
118,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Great game! Tons of replayability and a very fun zombie survival game! Definitely in my top 5 zombie games ever played. Edit: After playing 60+ hours, I can honestly say this is one of the better, more ""realistic"" zombie games. It's very much designed like survival horror as you must conserve ammo, treat your own wounds when bleeding out, take pills when infected, etc. Also, I find zombies to feel very natural and are well-animated for a free-to-play game. P.S.: I would recommend getting 1 or 2 friends to play with, but the community is super friendly and you can usually make friends or chat with people in the chat or over voice comms."
119,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"02/07/2014 - It's unfortunate I can't fully recommend or enjoy this game. From the brief time I've played it, I know I'd be hooked if it weren't for these two significant issues. No Australian servers mean one red bar puts you at a severe disadvantage and creates unbearable lag. Additionally, when I played the offline training mode, it was also stuttering (how does that even happen?). Coupled with poor ping, it ruins the experience. Everything, including menus, backgrounds, training, and in-game visuals, artifacts excessively. I've never had this issue before with this card and thought it might dislike my overclocking. I returned my GPU to stock settings, yet it made no difference."
120,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Late last night, I finished this. The story itself might not be very deep or intriguing, but the storytelling sets it apart. The atmosphere is immersive, and the many collectibles effectively flesh it out. I learned much about Batman's world, so it was somewhat disappointing that there were so few bosses. However, future games can address this. The combat provides a decent challenge, although leaning towards the easier side. Leveling up Batman felt unsatisfying. The gadgets you upgrade and acquire during the campaign introduce new gameplay mechanics that are quite enjoyable. Gaining access to previously unreachable areas imparts a satisfying sense of progression."
121,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"'To the Moon' is no mere game; it is a veritable experience, and one of the best of my life at that. Think Telltale's The Walking Dead is sad? It's no match for To the Moon! Never before have I felt so depressed yet fulfilled over something purely fictional. This masterpiece is the pinnacle of storytelling in my opinion, and the soundtrack is a charming and perfect accompaniment. Yes, the controls are a bit finicky, and the gameplay is not the strong point, but the story is so fantastic that I didn’t care. Plus, the humor of the game is great and does not intrude upon the distinguished nature of the story. The Doctor Who references are endless."
122,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Bastion is a brilliant game with an exceptional storyline. Set after a calamity, you begin rebuilding on the bastion. The game offers significant choices, like what to construct for an advantage, which weapons to use, and which power-ups to apply. You can also select drinks for bonus effects. The art style and music are fantastic, with vibrant visuals that defy typical apocalyptic dullness. Best of all, the game features narration based on your actions. For instance, if you pick up a weapon then switch it in the armory, the narration will comment on you taking the new weapon."
123,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"I originally bought this game during its early development phase, when the only currency was spacebux, and there was no 'tech tree'. This was when the game was at its best. All the guns were equally overpowered, so there were no issues with imbalance; everyone could eliminate anyone at any time. The game used to offer unlimited gun slots and five loadouts. You would think that a game boasting 'bajillions of guns' would provide more than 6 weapon slots and 3 loadouts before requiring payment for additional options. At one point, I had about 3 pages worth of guns and was planning new ideas for more, because for me, that's where the fun was."
124,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"This game was a surprising gem. Often, rave reviews are misleading, but in this case, they truly capture the fun of this neat little game. It is an intriguing mix between a classic 2D platformer and a MOBA, executed with style. I found myself enjoying characters I wouldn't typically enjoy in other MOBA games. Expecting this trait to continue, I decided to try a melee tank anyway. I was pleasantly surprised by the experience and ended up exploring more as they were unlocked from playing. The art style and interface are charmingly unique. Now, I use one of the characters as my avatar and created a wallpaper from a card set for the game."
125,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"I just started playing, but I love this game. I put on my headphones and lose myself for hours. It's been awhile since a game had that effect on me. The music sets the mood, sound effects are spot on, and controls are perfect. I look forward to every combat, and they've optimized it extremely well. I had doubts about the naval combat system, but it is so much fun to lay waste to multiple fleets! The only way to lose is to fail to retreat. If combat looks overwhelming, just retreat, regroup, and counter-assault. Thanks, devs, for an awesome experience!"
126,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"The reboot of the Devil May Cry franchise has introduced many changes, particularly for the series' protagonist, Dante. While fans of the original series may be upset by the changes to their beloved character, it's undeniably for the better, as this new game by Ninja Theory demonstrates. DMC is an ideal entry point for newcomers to the series, showcasing the origins of an arrogant, cynical Dante and chronicling his journey from cynicism to selflessness. Throughout, the game weaves a clear narrative arc for the new Dante, making him a compelling character to follow. The story follows Dante as he's introduced to the corrupt world he previously chose to ignore."
127,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Where do I begin with this absolutely beautiful game? Its story is utterly charming, brimming with detail, humor, quirky dogs, and secrets. It balances seriousness with humor seamlessly. The character design is exceptional, featuring a diverse array of personalities and intriguing secrets. It stands out from other RPGs by not requiring players to kill, a unique concept in the genre. Drawing inspiration from EarthBound, one of the best RPGs I've encountered, it promises an exceptional experience. The soundtrack is truly the best I've heard in ages."
128,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"I recommend this solely because it's free, and it might offer a more enjoyable experience for others. As for my experience, the game did nothing for me. Half the story relies on shock factor. I was not shocked or emotionally moved. Maybe I'm desensitized, or perhaps it was too simple to elicit a reaction. The other half of the game attempts to depict a person in mental decline, dealing with obsession, hallucination, and depression. In theory, it's a cool idea. However, the game took me 10 minutes to complete, even with reading and absorbing every bit of information."
129,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Do I even need to explain why Portal is amazing? Portal is a puzzle game that introduces a concept and then lets you engage. It's an excellent way to challenge your mind while remaining enjoyable. Although this game isn't heavily focused on story, it spawned one of the most popular games of 2011. I still play and complete it when I'm bored, appreciating what gave birth to a legend. Gameplay: Portal's gameplay is quite simple, at least in explanation. You utilize portals to your advantage, alongside buttons that activate parts of the puzzle. There are two types of buttons in the game: one you press and another requiring a cube."
130,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"If you can overlook the bugs (I personally encountered only two: one minor and the other quite annoying), both of which have been resolved, I can definitely recommend this space exploration game. One fix increased my FPS from 60-90 to 80-120. Since most reviews focus on specs, I'll include mine: i5 6600k (~200€), Radeon RX480 (~200€), Z170 Pro - Gaming (~150€), 16GB DDR4 RAM (~70€). This ~650€ setup is in the medium price range, albeit quite new, with almost constant 60+ FPS on high settings with Vsync enabled. I genuinely can't believe 90% of the comments saying they have an overkill setup and get 20 FPS."
131,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Remember Age of Mythology? It’s been quite some time since there’s been an RTS game of similar quality. Divinity: Dragon Commander comes impressively close to these benchmarks of my personal favorite RTS games. Coupled with a substantial, risk-like grand strategy mode, it truly hits the mark. I strive not to be overly biased, but the game’s feature allowing you to transform into a dragon—supporting, attacking, and even commanding unit production and direction simultaneously—is impressive. I genuinely appreciate complex RTS games today, like Civ V. However, these games often attempt to incorporate complex mechanics, charts, and resources into a single, intricate game mode."
132,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Undertale comes together to create something greater than the sum of its parts. The graphics are solid for a retro title, and the music is captivating. Paired together, they form truly beautiful and impactful moments. The script ranges from comedic to dramatic to heartbreaking to hopeful, sometimes all at once, while cleverly subverting RPG tropes. And this is without even delving into the world, characters, story, or gameplay... I could write pages about it. Instead, I'll just say: if you like RPGs, play this game. If you like video games, play this game. If you have seven free hours between now and the end of your life, play this game."
134,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"I've only had this game for a few months, but in that short time, two DLCs have been released, along with patches that have transformed an already great game into an excellent one. The developers are very active in the community, which is evident in the discussion forums and dev diaries. There is a steep learning curve to the game's mechanics, which I'm still learning; however, this breadth of strategy offers myriad ways to achieve goals and take advantage of situations. In my opinion, the game is almost infinitely replayable. I find myself drawn into every session, regardless of how the playthrough is going."
135,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Warframe is entertaining for the first few hours. Afterward, you'll notice that the game mainly offers repetition in its combat, enemies, and gameplay. The major highlight is the developers' commitment, evident in their semi-frequent updates, adding substantial content, ranging from changes to some of the game's systems to new warframes and other features. It's suitable for casual play. However, it may not captivate you for more than a few months unless you're fond of grinding. The advantage is that the game is free, so I'd recommend giving it a try. If you're seeking a quick fix, try it out."
136,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"This game is incredibly boring. I bought it believing it was a PC version of 'Katamari Damacy,' a popular and enjoyable PS2 game. Sadly, it's far from it. In this game, you absorb increasingly larger things to grow bigger and absorb even larger things. However, the gameplay lacks smoothness, the levels are not inventive, and what's present is a surreal horror show. It's not an entertaining horror show but one that leaves you rather depressed, questioning if life is all it should be. Every 'living' creature in this game, from small pets to humans, makes me wonder if the creators were interested in taxidermy."
137,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Alright. Let me explain a few things. As someone very interested in politics, I was intrigued by this game when I first heard about it. I thought, ""Oh wow! A simulator of the road to becoming president! That sounds fun!"" Well, it really wasn't. The game starts off by requiring you to pick a side: Republican or Democrat, with no option for independent or third-party.

Some keys are hardcoded and cannot be rebound. Glitches are rampant. At one point, my Pip-Boy vanished permanently, requiring research into console commands to restore it. You don’t have to earn power armor; it’s practically given from the start, with power cores abundantly available in trader shops. The value of power armor has diminished significantly from previous Fallout games. The story is mediocre, and overall, the game is unimpressive, although it doesn't crash every 10 minutes like Fallout 3, making it very stable in comparison. Is it better than Fallout 3? No. Is it better than New Vegas? No. This title was so overhyped for how disappointing it actually is."

There’s no magic ammo pool; reloading halfway will leave you with a pouch full of partial mags. You can't run endlessly. Sprinting for a while affects your aim as you gasp for breath.

Specifically, each local minimum involves fitting multiple Gaussians to a single true component and fitting a single Gaussian to multiple true components without overlap. Our findings apply when the true mixture components satisfy a specific separation condition and remain valid whether the number of components is over- or under-specified. For Gaussian mixtures with three components, we obtain sharper results concerning the scaling with the separation between the components."

For $n$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-like states, the most robust witness scheme requires $n+1$ local measurement settings and can tolerate up to $1/2$ white noise.

These geometries can disrupt the axial and equatorial symmetry of the Kerr metric and possess a significantly richer multipolar structure, offering a pathway to constrain fuzzball models phenomenologically. We find numerical evidence that all multipole moments are generally larger (in absolute value) than those of a Kerr black hole with the same mass and spin.

Existing approaches to user cold-start recommendation either require additional user effort, such as conducting interviews, or utilize side information like demographics, locations, and social relations. However, users may be unwilling to participate in interviews, and side information about cold-start users is often unavailable."
228,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,paper_abstract,"Deep learning has solved many problems beyond the reach of heuristic algorithms. It has also been successfully applied in wireless communications, despite the fact that current radio systems are well-understood and optimal algorithms exist for numerous tasks. While some improvements have been achieved by learning individual parts of a receiver, a more effective approach is to jointly learn the entire receiver. This often results in a challenging nonlinear problem, for which the optimal solution is infeasible to implement. To address this, we propose a deep fully convolutional neural network, deeprx, which executes the whole receiver pipeline, from frequency domain signal stream to uncoded bits, in a 5g-compliant manner. We enhance accurate channel estimation by constructing the input of the convolutional neural network in a very specific manner using both the data and pilot symbols."
229,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,paper_abstract,"Mutation-based fuzzing typically begins with an initial set of non-crashing seed inputs (a corpus) to generate new inputs through mutation. A corpus often contains thousands of similar inputs, and this lack of diversity can result in wasted effort due to exhaustive mutation from all available seeds. To counter this, fuzzers provide distillation tools (e.g., afl-cmin) that select the smallest subset of seeds, triggering the same range of instrumentation data points as the full corpus. It is commonly believed that minimizing the number and size of seeds enhances fuzzing efficiency. We systematically explore this and present results of over 34 CPU-years of fuzzing using five distillation approaches to assess their impact in uncovering bugs in real-world software."
230,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,paper_abstract,"In this paper, we investigate multi-agent discrete-event systems with partial observation. The agents can be divided into groups wherein each has similar (isomorphic) state transition structures and can be relabeled into the same template. Based on this template, a scalable supervisor is designed, whose state size and computational cost are independent of the number of agents, even in partial observation. Regardless of how many agents are added or removed from the system, the scalable supervisor does not need to be recomputed. We extend our previous results to partial observation by proposing sufficient conditions for safety and maximal permissiveness at the template level. An example is provided to illustrate the proposed scalable supervisory synthesis."
231,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,paper_abstract,"Electric network frequency (ENF) fluctuations are a powerful tool in multimedia forensics. An efficient approach for ENF estimation is introduced using temporal windowing with the filter-bank Capon spectral estimator. A type of Gohberg-Semencul factorization of the model covariance matrix is employed due to the Toeplitz structure. Moreover, this approach utilizes, for the first time, a non-rectangular temporal window preceding spectral estimation. Krylov matrices are used for fast implementation of matrix inversions. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in ENF estimation, especially when a short time window of one second is utilized in power recordings. In speech recordings, the proposed approach yields high accuracy in terms of both time complexity and overall precision."

The dimension reduction methods included fall into three categories: projection pursuit-based dimension reduction, sufficient dimension reduction, and robust M-estimators for dimension reduction. Additionally, regularized regression estimators based on these reduced dimension spaces are offered, ranging from classical principal component regression to sparse partial robust M regression. The package also includes various classical and robust pre-processing utilities, such as generalized spatial signs, along with dedicated plotting functionality and cross-validation utilities. Moreover, direpack is designed to be consistent with the scikit-learn API, enabling seamless integration of its estimators into learning pipelines within that framework."
233,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,paper_abstract,"Nonlinear fluorescence emission is widely used for high spatial resolution optical imaging. We studied the fluorescence anomalous saturating effect of the nitrogen vacancy defect in diamond. With high power laser excitation, fluorescence reduction was observed. This increased the nonlinearity of the fluorescence emission and altered the spatial frequency distribution of the fluorescence image. A differential excitation protocol was employed to extract high spatial frequency information. By modulating the excitation laser's power, imaging spatial resolution improved approximately 1.6 times compared to confocal microscopy. Given the simplicity of the experimental setup and data processing, we expect this method to enhance spatial resolution in sensing and biological labeling applications using defects in solids."
234,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,paper_abstract,"When random effects are correlated with sample design variables, the typical use of individual survey weights (designed to be inversely proportional to the unit survey inclusion probabilities) to form a pseudo-likelihood no longer yields asymptotically unbiased inference. We create a weight-exponentiated formulation for the random effects distribution that achieves unbiased inference for generating hyperparameters of the random effects. We compare our approach with frequentist methods that rely on numerical integration, demonstrating that only the Bayesian method succeeds in achieving both unbiased estimation regarding the sampling design distribution and consistency with respect to the population generating distribution. Our simulations and real data examples, including a survey of business establishments, display the utility of our method across various modeling formulations and sampling designs. This work serves as a capstone for recent developmental efforts combining traditional survey estimation methods with the Bayesian modeling paradigm and bridges the two rich, distinct sub-fields."

The reduced symmetries of these emerging materials lead to inhomogeneous electron, optical, valley, and spin responses, as well as novel properties like ferroelasticity, ferroelectricity, magnetism, spin-wave phenomena, large nonlinear optical properties, photogalvanic effects, and superconductivity. Novel electronic topological properties, nonlinear elastic properties, and structural phase transformations can also occur due to low symmetry. The ""Beyond Graphene: Low-Symmetry and Anisotropic 2D Materials"" special topic was assembled to highlight recent experimental and theoretical research on these emerging materials."
236,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,paper_abstract,"The orientational dynamics in the isotropic phase of a comb-shaped nematic polymer with mesogenic and functional side groups were studied using the Kerr effect and dielectric spectroscopy. For the first time, it was discovered that in a mesogenic polymer, unlike low-molecular-weight mesogens, the relaxation of the electric birefringence in a melt above the nematic-isotropic phase transition temperature can be expressed as a sum of several exponential processes, two of which are crucial. These primary processes replace each other over a temperature range of about fifty degrees. Dielectric spectroscopy enabled the distinction of two processes of orientational relaxation: the first involves the rotation of the side mesogenic groups, and the second is linked to the motion of the main chain segments."
237,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,paper_abstract,"Deep hashing methods have demonstrated excellent retrieval accuracy and efficiency in large-scale image retrieval. Optimizing discrete hash bits is crucial in these methods. A typical approach is to use an activation function, such as $\operatorname{sigmoid}(\cdot)$ or $\operatorname{tanh}(\cdot)$, and minimize a quantization loss to approximate discrete values. However, this can result in hash bits getting stuck in the wrong saturated areas of activation functions. We refer to this as the ""dead bits problem~(dbp)."" Furthermore, the existing quantization loss exacerbates dbp. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective gradient amplifier, applied before activation functions, to mitigate dbp."

We consider the possibility that triplets are stable and contribute to dark matter density, or that they decay via mixing with the Standard Model Higgs boson. The former is constrained by disappearing charged track searches at the LHC and dark matter direct detection experiments, while the latter is constrained by existing multilepton collider searches. We find that a two-step electroweak phase transition involving a stable triplet with a negative quadratic term is ruled out by direct detection searches, while an unstable triplet with a mass less than $230\ \mathrm{GeV}$ is excluded at $95\%$ confidence level."
239,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,paper_abstract,"This paper demonstrates that the eccentric debris rings observed around the stars Fomalhaut and HD 202628 are narrower than anticipated in the standard eccentric planet perturbation scenario (sometimes referred to as ""pericenter glow""). The conventional scenario suggests an initially circular and narrow belt of planetesimals at semi-major axis $a$, whose eccentricity increases to $e_f$ after the gas disc disperses, due to secular perturbations from an eccentric planet, resulting in a belt of width $2ae_f$. In a slight alteration of this scenario, narrower belts can form if the planetesimals are initially eccentric, possibly resulting from earlier planet perturbations during the gas-rich protoplanetary disc phase. However, primordial eccentricity could alternatively be driven by instabilities that enhance the disc's eccentricity, independent of any planets."

In one dimension (1D), the physics of interacting electrons is captured well at low energies by the Tomonaga-Luttinger-liquid (TLL) model, yet little has been observed experimentally beyond this linear regime. Here, we report on measurements of many-body modes in 1D gated wires using a tunneling spectroscopy technique. We observe two separate Fermi seas at high energies, associated with spin and charge excitations, together with the emergence of three additional 1D 'replica' modes that strengthen with decreasing wire length. The effective interaction strength in the wires is varied by changing the amount of 1D inter-subband screening by over 45%."

It is likely that the globular cluster system of our galaxy has followed a similarly intricate formation path. To constrain this formation path, we explore the link between the globular clusters and the known merging events that the Milky Way has experienced. To this end, we combined the kinematic information provided by Gaia for almost all galactic clusters, with the largest sample of cluster ages available after carefully correcting for systematic errors. To identify clusters with a common origin, we analyzed their dynamical properties, particularly in the space of integrals of motion. We find that about 40% of the clusters likely formed in situ."

Our micromagnetic simulation results on the nonlinear responses of MSM and STNOs with current pulse stimulation demonstrate that an RC system using a single MSM excels in image classification. Moreover, complex unknown nonlinear dynamic problems are effectively solved by a physical RC system consisting of 24 STNOs, confirmed in both a second-order nonlinear dynamic system and NARMA10 tasks."

This paper identifies a surprising outcome of popularity-based rankings: fewer items reporting a specific signal attract a disproportionately high share of overall traffic. This few-get-richer effect occurs in contexts with limited distinct item classes (e.g., left-leaning vs. right-leaning news) where items are ranked by popularity. We analytically show that this effect arises when users frequently click top-ranked items and have varied class preferences. Simulations explore how the effect's intensity varies with different setting and behavior assumptions. Additionally, we experimentally test our predictions with human participants. Our findings are significant for understanding misinformation spread."

However, many pruning techniques involve trade-offs between model accuracy and regularity, which result in impaired inference accuracy and limited on-device acceleration. To address this, we introduce a new sparsity dimension called pattern-based sparsity, comprising pattern and connectivity sparsity, which is both highly accurate and hardware-friendly. With carefully designed patterns, the proposed pruning achieves unprecedented and consistent accuracy enhancement and improved feature extraction across different DNN structures and datasets. Our pattern-aware pruning framework also includes pattern library extraction, pattern selection, pattern and connectivity pruning, and weight training simultaneously. Our approach to pattern-based sparsity naturally integrates with compiler optimization for highly efficient DNN execution on mobile platforms."

Creating a more closely matched control group by aligning a subset of the overall control group with the treated group may reduce bias. We explore this phenomenon through simulation studies. We examine the effect of mountaintop removal mining (MRM) on mortality using a difference-in-differences analysis that utilizes the increase in MRM following the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments. For this analysis of MRM's impact on mortality, we constructed a more closely matched control group and found a 95% confidence interval that includes significant adverse effects, as well as no effect and minor beneficial effects."

This procedure is a generic method that is generally straightforward to apply.

They had no family other than each other—they didn’t even know their parents. One of the brothers, Deminan, looked different from the others. His skin was covered in painful scabs, and he wondered why only he bore this affliction. One day, while the supreme spirit Yaya was away in his gardens, Deminan and his brothers sneaked into Yaya’s house. After feasting and exploring, they noticed a giant gourd hanging in the corner. When they tried to look inside, they accidentally dropped it."
275,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"Seven years ago, I graduated from Berkeley with a dual degree in Molecular and Cell Biology and Linguistics. At a campus career fair, I secured an interview with a start-up called Theranos. At the time, there was limited information about the company, but what was available was impressive. The company aimed to create a medical device capable of running a full blood panel from a finger-stick of blood. This innovation was intriguing not only because it was less painful than traditional methods but also because it could potentially pave the way for predictive diagnostics."
276,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"My journey to becoming a polar specialist, focusing on photographing and studying the polar regions, began when I was four years old. My family moved from southern Canada to northern Baffin Island, near Greenland. We lived with the Inuit in a small community of 200 people, where we were one of three non-Inuit families. Without television, computers, or even a telephone, I spent all my time outside with the Inuit. The snow and ice became my playground, and the Inuit were my teachers. This is where I developed a deep obsession with the polar realm."
277,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"We're seen as the organization that absorbs the consequences of failed social policy. I can't decide who comes to us or how long they stay. We take in those for whom nothing else has worked, individuals who have slipped through all other social safety nets. They can't contain them, so we must. That's our job: manage and control them. Over the years, as a prison system, as a nation, and as a society, we've become very proficient at that, but that shouldn't bring you satisfaction. Today, we incarcerate more people per capita than any other country in the world. We have more black men in prison today than were under slavery in 1850."
278,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"I'd like to take you on the epic quest of the Rosetta spacecraft. Escorting and landing the probe on a comet has been my passion for the past two years. For this mission, I need to explain something about the origin of the solar system. Going back four and a half billion years, there was a cloud of gas and dust. In the center of this cloud, our Sun formed and ignited. Along with that, planets, comets, and asteroids formed. What then happened, according to theory, is that when the Earth cooled down after its formation, comets impacted Earth and delivered water. They probably also delivered complex organic material, which may have bootstrapped the emergence of life."
279,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"Chris Anderson: Hello, TED community, welcome back for another live conversation. Today, it's a big one, as big as they get. When we created this ""Build Back Better"" series, our thought was how we could address issues arising from the pandemic and imagine rebuilding from that. However, the events of this past week, the horrific death of George Floyd and the daily protests that have followed, have provided a new urgency that we, of course, simply have to address. Can we build back better from this? Before we can even begin to answer that question, we must first seek to understand the immensity of this moment. Whitney Pennington Rodgers: That's right, Chris."
280,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"In 1903, the President of the United States went on a three-day camping trip in California’s Yosemite Valley. President Theodore Roosevelt spent nights among towering sequoia trees, camped in a snowstorm, and had extensive discussions around the campfire with his host and guide, the conservationist John Muir. While Roosevelt was a known outdoor enthusiast, Muir invited him for more than just camping; Yosemite was under threat. Although designated protected land in 1864, the valley faced risks of overdevelopment in 1903. This area was central to a long-standing struggle to reserve land for preservation and public use—two objectives that were challenging to achieve. The battle over Yosemite began during the 1849 Gold Rush when miners flocked west, seeking riches in the Sierra Nevada foothills."
281,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"Hello. This is my first trip and the first time in my life that I'm outside the walls of Gaza. I'm so happy to be here. (applause) My ambition has always been to be a pilot, to fly a plane, and to feel free to soar through the sky. But that didn't happen. Simply put, I live in Gaza, where there is no airport, and all borders are closed on every side. We live in one of the biggest prisons in the world. The only thing I can do is look up to the sky. On some days, we are lucky if we have electricity for four or five hours. When it's cold, we make a fire in front or on our roofs."
282,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"I'm sorry I cannot show you my face because, if I do, the bad guys will come for me. My journey began 14 years ago. I was a young reporter, fresh out of college. Then I got a scoop—a simple story: police officers were taking bribes from hawkers on the streets. As a young reporter, I wanted to handle it uniquely to maximize its impact. Everyone knew it was happening, yet nothing changed, so I decided to act as a seller. This allowed me to document hard-core evidence. The impact was incredible; it was fantastic. Many call this immersion journalism or undercover journalism."
283,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"One simple vitamin can reduce your risk of heart disease. Eating chocolate reduces stress in students. A new drug prolongs the lives of patients with a rare disease. Health headlines like these are published every day, sometimes making contradictory claims. There can be a disconnect between broad, attention-grabbing headlines and the often specific, incremental results of the medical research they cover. So how can you avoid being misled by sensational headlines? The best way to assess a headline’s credibility is to look at the original research it reports on. We’ve devised a hypothetical research scenario for each of these three headlines. Keep watching for the explanation of the first example; then pause at the headline to answer the question. These are simplified scenarios."
284,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"When I was 14, my family was adopting my little brothers from Ethiopia. One day, my mom asked, ""What day should we put for their birthday?"" I thought, ""The day they were born, obviously?"" A ridiculous question. Then my mom explained, ""Kristen, neither of your little brothers have a birth certificate, so how do you suggest we find out when that was?"" Mind blown. Now, 20 years later, I'm still working on it. Instead of solving the mystery of my brothers' missing birth certificates, I address this problem globally. So, what do birth certificates have to do with international development?"
285,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"Imagine if you could connect your brain to a machine that would provide you with ultimate pleasure for the rest of your life. If you were offered a chance to live this way, would you? That’s the question philosopher Robert Nozick posed through a thought experiment called the Experience Machine. The experiment asks us to imagine a world where scientists have developed a machine that simulates real life while ensuring only pleasurable experiences. The catch? You have to permanently leave reality behind, but you’ll hardly notice. Your experiences will be indistinguishable from reality. Life’s natural ups and downs are replaced with an endless series of ups. Sounds appealing, right?"
286,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"I would like to share the most embarrassing incident from my career as a palliative care physician. This occurred a few years ago. I was consulted to see a woman in her 70s—a retired English professor with pancreatic cancer. I was asked to see her due to her pain, nausea, and vomiting. During our consultation, she inquired whether medical marijuana might help her. I recalled what I had learned in medical school about medical marijuana, which didn't take long since I had learned absolutely nothing."
287,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"For the past 24 years, I have been a firefighter in Huntington, West Virginia. As firefighters, my team and I are tasked with saving lives and protecting property from disasters like car wrecks, house fires, and life-threatening medical emergencies. I am a woman leading a department in a male-dominated profession. Ten years ago, I decided to enhance my medical knowledge by earning a nursing degree. It became evident that the next big threat facing my city and others nationwide was not a simple disaster where you can rush in, extinguish the fire, and leave, feeling like everything is okay."
288,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"Where does all the carbon we release go? Carbon follows a natural cycle and is present in all living things: in the soil, oceans, atmosphere, and rocks deep underground. When plants and other organisms die, much of their stored carbon returns to the atmosphere until new plants grow and reabsorb it. Over millions of years, the carbon stored in ancient trees and sea life becomes rock or fossil fuels: coal, oil, and natural gas. Natural events like volcanic eruptions release carbon trapped in rock, and human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, also release prehistoric carbon. Today, humans release around 60 times more carbon than all the volcanoes on the planet each year."
289,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"Even nature's seemingly most unsightly creatures hold important secrets. However, who would want a swarm of cockroaches approaching them? One of the greatest distinctions between natural and human technologies is robustness. Robust systems are stable in complex and unfamiliar environments. Remarkably, cockroaches can self-stabilize while traversing rough terrain. When equipped with a jet pack or subjected to a disturbance like an earthquake, their finely tuned legs enable them to maintain stability without using any brainpower. They can navigate complex terrain like grass without becoming destabilized. We discovered a behavior where, due to their shape, they naturally roll to their side to navigate this artificial patch of grass. Robust systems can perform multiple tasks with the same structure. Here's a new behavior we've discovered."
290,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"These are grim economic times, fellow TEDsters, grim economic times indeed. I would like to cheer you up with one of the great, albeit largely unknown, commercial success stories of the past 20 years. Comparable, in its own peculiar way, to the achievements of Microsoft or Google. It's an industry which has bucked the current recession with equanimity. I refer to organized crime. Now, organized crime has been around for a very long time, I hear you say, and these would be wise words indeed. But in the last two decades, it has experienced an unprecedented expansion, now accounting for roughly 15 percent of the world's GDP. I like to call it the global shadow economy, or McMafia, for short. So, what triggered this extraordinary growth in cross-border crime?"
291,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"If you ask people which aspect of psychology they find challenging and mention ""thinking and emotions,"" most will respond, ""Emotions are incredibly complex. I have no idea how they work. But thinking is straightforward; it's just logical reasoning."" However, that's not the difficult part. So, here's a list of problems that arise. One notable issue is addressing health. Recently, I read that possibly the largest single cause of disease in the West is handshaking."
292,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"What is a parent? This question isn't easy to answer. Today, with adoption, stepfamilies, and surrogate mothers, many parents face challenging questions and decisions. Should we tell our child about the sperm donation? If so, when and what words should we use? Sperm donors are often called ""biological fathers,"" but should we use the term ""father""? As a philosopher and social scientist, I have studied these questions about parenthood. Today, I'll share what I've learned from speaking with parents and children, revealing that they understand what truly matters in a family, even when their family appears different."
293,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"When I look in the mirror today, I see a justice and education scholar at Columbia University, a youth mentor, an activist, and a future New York State senator. I see all that, and a man who spent a quarter of his life in state prison—six years, to be exact, starting as a teenager on Rikers Island for an act that nearly cost a man his life. But what got me from there to here wasn't the punishment I faced as a teenager in adult prison or the harshness of our legal system. Instead, it was a classroom environment that introduced me to something I didn't think was possible for me or our justice system. A few weeks before my release on parole, a counselor encouraged me to enroll in a new college course being offered in the prison."
294,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"What do you think when you look at me? A woman of faith? An expert? Maybe even a sister. Or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist. Or just an airport security line delay. That one's actually true. (Laughter) If some of your perceptions were negative, I don't really blame you. That's just how the media has been portraying people who look like me. One study found that 80 percent of news coverage about Islam and Muslims is negative. And studies show that Americans say most don't know a Muslim. I guess people don't talk to their Uber drivers. (Laughter) Well, for those of you who have never met a Muslim, it's great to meet you."
295,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"We need to build a weather service for water. Until we collectively demand accountability, the incentives for funding it will not exist. The first time I spoke at a conference was here at TED, eight years ago. Fresh out of grad school, little did I know that in those few minutes onstage, I was framing the questions I would be asked for the next decade. Like many 20-somethings, I expected to solve the world's water problems with my technology. I had a lot to learn. It was seductive to believe that our biggest water quality problems persist because they're hard to identify—I presumed we just needed simpler, faster, and more affordable sensors. I was wrong."
296,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"For 20 years, I worked in finance and was well-versed in the field, along with the global economy, which was central to my life. Topics like ecology and doomsday predictions, which I knew thoroughly, never held much weight for me. However, in 2007, the subprime crisis—a dramatic collapse of major American banks—served as a wake-up call. Many intense discussions with my wife followed, focusing on my career and the limitations of the existing model. Beyond just the crisis, I came to understand that I was entirely mistaken and that we were on a disastrous path."
297,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"So, I'll be speaking to you using language because I can. This is one of these magical abilities that we humans possess. We can convey complex thoughts to one another. What I'm doing right now is making sounds with my mouth as I exhale. I'm creating tones, hisses, and puffs, generating vibrations in the air. These air vibrations travel to you, striking your eardrums. Your brain then takes those vibrations and transforms them into thoughts. I hope that's happening. With this ability, humans can transmit ideas across vast expanses of space and time. We're able to share knowledge across minds."

Well, well. That’s unusually prescient for a human. Looking for a wedding dress? Try a new take on a timeless classic. It’s sleek, flattering, and modest—just like the traditional dress. Commercials. Could anything be more insufferable? It’s 1997, and the United States Senate has called a hearing about global warming.

It's an honor, as a politician, to give a TED talk, especially here in the U.K., where the reputation of politics, due to the expenses scandal, has sunk so low. There was even a story that scientists considered replacing rats in experiments with politicians. When asked ""why,"" they said, “well, there's no shortage of politicians, no one really minds what happens to them, and, after all, there are some things that rats just won't do.” (Laughter) Now, I know you all love data, so I'm starting with a data-rich slide."
