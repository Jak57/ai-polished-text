1,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"Another week flew by me. I drove by the new house yesterday and the front window was covered in boxes. I'm getting excited about getting the keys at closing this week. If everything goes well, we'll be set for closing a week from Wednesday. I was up until after 3 00 am last night watching movies with Bethany. There's been a lot of movie-watching going on around here lately. Here's my rundown  we watched ""Thirteen"" - a movie every mother of a teenager should see. It was better than I expected. Then we watched ""Gigli"" - yeah, it was just as bad as the media said it was, but we had to see for ourselves."
2,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"Summer TV used to be a barren landscape of reruns, but now there are two exceptional new shows that have captivated me for the past week. I stumbled upon the most unlikely concept  a hairstylist, Jonathan Antin, aiming to expand his popular West Hollywood salon to Beverly Hills. Initially, I wouldn't have given it a second thought, but while channel surfing, I caught a glimpse of Jonathan, equally self-absorbed and unremarkable, surveying an empty space on Rodeo Drive, boasting (in a public voice) ""I will build here the greatest salon in the world's history!"" I was hooked. Not since Rocco have I found a character so mesmerizing to watch."
3,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"What a week has been challenging for me. My right shoulder has tendonitis, located under my shoulder blade. When I move my arm excessively, particularly when using a mouse on a computer, it exacerbates the pain. I've been on a spree updating my website and working on other online projects, which has left me with little strength to draw or lift anything. Lack of sleep has added to my discomfort. I'm not feeling well at the moment, but I'm hopeful that I'll recover soon. My mom's surgery was successful, and her eyesight has partially recovered. She can now see fuzzy shapes and distinguish colors. Her vision is still not fully restored, but I'm optimistic that she will regain her sight soon."
4,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"Kindness of strangers is something I experienced firsthand today while attempting to do laundry with the kids in tow. I was struck by how quickly the simplest tasks can become overwhelming. I also learned that total strangers can be surprisingly kind and sweet, often for no reason other than a genuine desire to be kind. It wasn't as if they were trying to get something from me or anything. I had a child's drool all over me and was wearing my ""wash-day"" outfit. Additionally, I'm not sure I'll ever be bathing again, so there was no real incentive there! I'm doing two things simultaneously  composing a post and watching collected no-doubt videos. I'm doing both tasks sitting at my desk in my room."
5,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"It's 11 14 pm MST, and I'm currently in my bedroom, fixing the personal computer of my job's personnel director. I don't mind doing it, but I often wonder when I find myself fixing someone else's computer as a favor. I'm grateful to be able to serve and support others, but I sometimes question where the line is drawn where it becomes exploitation. Over the past couple of weeks, I've been staying up late reading, so I was looking forward to an early bedtime, until I realized it would be more practical to get this computer back to its owner."
6,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"After lunch, my confidence wavered, I forgot to share an important piece of the story. Before Pat arrived for lunch, Dustin started discussing what a nice guy Pat is and his efforts to find a girlfriend for him. I listened and nodded, realizing we were talking more about finding Dustin's best friend a girl than discussing something with a stranger over pink lemonade. I excused myself to the bathroom, looked in the mirror, and silently asked  Am I being pawned off to the other guy? Is this what happens now?"
7,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"I implore everyone to pause and reflect before acting impulsively. It would be beneficial for each individual to take a moment to contemplate before arising from bed in the morning, and to commit to a day of thoughtful consideration. If they are not prepared to do so, I would suggest that they reconsider their actions and return to a restful slumber. I'm exhausted by the thought of people acting without thinking. I'm not claiming to be the most intelligent person in the world, but I believe it's reasonable to criticize the foolish. Let's focus on a specific type of person for now, and save some for another occasion."
8,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"Two problems with the scenario outlined in my previous post  1. The stimulus package, while stimulating the economy, has a lasting impact that is not desirable. Robert Rubin, a renowned expert, told NPR's Marketplace that the same economic boost could have been achieved without the long-term debt burden by enacting targeted tax cuts that benefit low- and middle-income individuals. Ah, Robert Rubin, his name is music to our ears. Quickly  name one Bush administration cabinet official with Rubin's gravitas. Still thinking? It'll come to you... 2. We cannot cede control to the Republicans solely during wartime because they've cleverly crafted a perpetual, global ""war on terror."""
10,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"Do you ever have those moments when you begin to reflect on life, feeling disconnected from the monotony of daily routine? Like sitting in math class, you start to wonder what exactly goes on in your brain that makes you understand complex mathematical concepts. And then you realize that you exist, and you're in math class, and you wonder why. Suddenly, it hits you â€“ the fact that you're going on this random train of thought is incredibly humbling. Ever had that happen? I detest that. I also detest block schedules. Who would ever come up with that idea? Anyone can see that sitting through a two and a half hour class in any subject is an unusual punishment."

Tonight, Andi beat me by a few small dollars and won the farqu game. Perhaps I let him win because he left in a few short hours, and I wanted him to feel good on his last night here. However, the story goes, it can't compare to this Texas-sized headache I have at the moment. I've taken some Aleve, and I must say they're doing the trick. All I need now is some well-deserved R&R."
12,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"Today has been a long day. I'm going to have to be selective about what I write about, as I could take up a lot of time and space and I just don't have enough energy. First, I have to say that camp was amazing and even better than I could have expected. God has been doing so much in my life lately, and it's just incredible. I've turned over a new leaf, but anyway, back to the beginning. We arrived at the Twiggs' house on Friday evening and stayed until we left for camp on Monday. Most of what we did was visit the fair, attend church, watch a parade, shop at Walmart, and watch movies."

I'm excited to be done with it, but I have a dentist appointment at 9 a.m. I'm a bit nervous about it, but I'd rather get it over with than try to schedule it during the first month of my surgery rotation. As a perfectionist, I strive for excellence in everything I do. However, starting new things can be challenging. I'm anxious about being a pawn in unfamiliar territory and not knowing what's to come."
14,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"Arun Shourie discusses how, as far back as 1996, the then-governor of Uttar Pradesh had warned of the impending threat of a ""third Islamic state"" in the subcontinent. T.V. Rajeswar, the former head of the Intelligence Bureau and current governor of Uttar Pradesh, had published a series of articles in the Hindustan Times, foreseeing this dire threat. Shourie raises a pertinent question, asking whether the fact that Rajeswar, not he or Mr. Advani, authored these warnings lends credibility to the predictions or whether it merely implies that Rajeswar is a closet communalist, disqualifying him from continuing as governor."
15,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"Attitude  indifferent, looking forward to tonight, it's been a long and challenging day in the trenches here, with little time to write anything for you readers. However, it's good to see Tigger taking up the reins and making an appearance, discussing things. Not much to say about yesterday, but it was a lovely day at the park, where I saw a Shakespeare play, but I had to leave before the closing curtain, which was a bit disappointing. I hope to see the entirety of a Shakespeare play someday. On a different note, Akcron is right about the problems with the shower, it's quite amusing to laugh at oneself in the shower, as people's reactions can be quite entertaining."

Last evening, I went home and just slept off, only getting up when my mother called me around 8 30. When I woke up, it was all dark, and I hadn't switched the lights on, so I couldn't figure out what time or date it was for a few seconds, it was just my mother's voice in the darkness and me grappling with reality. I wonder why I'm feeling so drained..."
17,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"Last night was a disappointing evening. I regretfully discarded the sweater I was crafting. With only 14 inches completed, I lost approximately $10 worth of yarn, as each skein costs $8. Unfortunately, the yarn became increasingly knotted as I reached the arm holes, making frogging (ripping out rows) challenging. The yarn broke frequently. I refrained from cussing, a rare feat for me. Instead, I morosely ripped and indulged in season two of Sex and the City (a welcome distraction). Eventually, I grew tired of it and discarded the project. I suppose I gained some valuable experience from the experience."
18,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"Last night in class, we explored the assigned reading, ""Toward a Renewed Study of the Place-World"" by Edward S. Casey. The first chapter, ""Implacement,"" and the second, ""Displacement,"" introduced key concepts. Casey argues that our contemporary world and culture revolve around time as the situating force. He contends that we're running out of time, have saved time, and are just in time. The author is making the case that using place as the center of culture fosters a more grounded community. This book has captivated me, providing a unique perspective that resonates deeply."
19,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"Whatever it is they put into freeze pops to make them those colours, there should be some sort of warning. And while giggling is good, one wonders if we would have found ourselves up that fire escape drinking beer in the fierce wind had we not been eating them earlier. Finding ourselves in a doorway to a bar sadly closed for business, we stopped to examine an office-supplies catalogue that had arrived in the post. We discovered some surprising offers. Who could have guessed that within these pages were the special offers of a lifetime? Not I, for certain."
20,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"Currently listening to  The Little Drummer Boy by Stevan Pasero... And now, my post... Senate Republicans, okay, hands up - who watched the 39-hour judicial nomination marathon last week? I know I didn't. Well, okay - I did tune in once or twice. The entire colossal waste of time was perpetrated by Republicans who, upset that Democrats wouldn't roll over and nominate four of Bush's nominees, were trying to score political points by holding a multi-day spectacle."
21,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"This was a satisfying weekend. I devoted quality time to nature, after a long hiatus, and indulged in a lot of never-before-listened-to music. I finished three books over the weekend - Bruce Sterling's ""Heavy Weather"", Larry Niven's ""World of Ptavvs"", and Octavia Butler's ""Parable of the Sower"". ""Heavy Weather"" was a thrilling cyberpunk adventure through a near-future USA ravaged by global warming and anarchy. While it was well-paced and convincingly written, I must admit that I didn't come away with any profound insights about the story or characters. Both are well-crafted and vividly portrayed - it's a good book, but not a standout."
22,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"After the first week back from practicum, I struggled, but it wasn't until the second week that the smoke started to clear. Post-practicum trauma was a hidden epidemic that's only now coming to light. Meeting with the course coordinator allowed me to release my burden, preventing another student from being stuck with a pedagogically deficit practicum experience. On Monday, I ran into another agrieved classmate who was determined to warn a fellow student about the terrible experience. I calmed her down and suggested we report to the administrator first."
23,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"Well, things have been incredibly busy lately, but there's always time for stress-relieving activities. I've found that I'm not particularly skilled at 8-ball and ping pong! Rick, also known as the Canuck, consistently beats me in a regular game - we have a ping pong table in the front lobby of our building, always available for a quick match. Last night, I participated in an 8-ball tournament at the hot spot, our recreation tent, which features a popcorn machine, multiple TVs, jukebox, DVD rentals, pool table, dartboard, and the ever-present ping pong table. I had a decent showing, until I scratched on the eight ball, unfortunately. Still, I had a great time, and the highlight was the two Dutch soldiers who joined in the tournament."
24,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"Fall 1974  I was attempting for what felt like the 13th time to fight my way through the second chapter of my high school algebra book. I'm not a math person, and I hate math - I'm math phobic. You get the picture. As I struggled to make sense of algebra, the doorbell rang. I put down my book and went to open the door. No one was there. I returned to my studies, just as I was finding a glimmer of understanding, the doorbell rang again. Just what a struggling math student needs, an uninvited practical joke."
25,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"This past week has been a whirlwind of activity. I spent Tuesday to Thursday finishing the move to my new classroom. The new room is larger and closer to my grade-level team, which are the things I need to consider as I spend hours preparing my space for this year. If I had known I was going to move prior to the end of my school year, I would have discarded much of the books and supplies I no longer use. Unfortunately, it all came with me. This week was spent moving, unpacking, and purging. I have to thank my teammate Jill for helping with all of this. She was still teaching this month in my old room, so she and her lovely students moved almost my entire room for me."

Even if I never carried you as a child, even if I was never married to you, even if I was never an official partner to you... I loved you immensely, and to this day, the feeling carries an echo through my heart. Forever, I'll always be reminded of the few nights we spent together, our hearts and limbs entwined in a soul-embrace, bathed in the salty darkness of an evening by the beach, or a kiss under the rain. Whenever I feel the sting of a dark glass piercing my heart, you will be there. That piece of you... the eternal love that once lived in me... and still remains."
27,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"I'm uncomfortable with investigative reporting. The article I'm doing and its consequences is not something I'm comfortable with. Perhaps it's because I don't believe in it enough, so I cannot get the complete feel for it. The angst behind it. The full-out passion towards it to question. I've grown up in a country where you don't ask questions. You just don't. They shoot you for that. They put you in jail with internal security acts. I'm not used to this freedom of speech, not used to question out loud."
28,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"We embarked on an outing with my colleagues from the bank to Guintubdan, La Caralota, a destination we had never visited before. The trek to the falls took approximately 30 minutes, and we were all grateful to have made it, catching our breaths as we arrived. The water was icy cold, and the chill was palpable, leaving our bodies numb. We spent less than an hour at the falls before continuing to the nearby waterfalls, another 30-minute trek. Despite the challenges, the trip was rewarding, as the falls presented a serene and breathtaking scene, evoking a sense of oneness with nature. Soaking in the cold water was a meditative experience, as if communing with Mother Earth. The crisp air and water lulled us into a state of relaxation, almost sleep."

With a month left before Ed leaves, I think it's starting to sink in with Ed and all of us. I think it's sunk in with me a long time ago. I just hope Ed will be here for Bailey's surgery.

Thank goodness I brought a bag of eggs with me just in case. So Connor had a great time finding eggs out in the park. Sunday morning when he woke up, he was so excited that the Easter bunny had come. There's nothing better than seeing the excitement on your child's face. After egg hunting, we all went to church. Even though the Easter bunny is fun and all, we do make sure our kids know the true meaning of the holidays. This was Megan's first Easter, she looked so cute in her jean dress and stockings."

When I went upstairs to discuss my issues with Nicole about Kelli, I felt frustrated and didn't want to burden them with my problems. They often want me to share my concerns, but I don't have to explain everything to them. The situation with Nicole and Kelli is that they don't get along."

However, I believe too much energy was spent on the set, which was magnificent, and not enough on creating a solidifying tone, theme, and so on. It retold the story, but it was not particularly gripping, and I don't feel like I gained anything from watching it. The character development was rather weak. Additionally, I thought the score was poor, and was basically a knock-off of the Gladiator. The Gladiator used the background music of a moaning woman, and it worked because it backed up and complemented a genuinely gripping narrative."

Since transacting these currency transactions with our energy customers is a new area of business for us, I just wanted us all to be mindful to check these old resolutions and not to rely solely on the ""restrictions"" contained in Lotus notes."

I felt like all the collectibles actually served a purpose in this game, something I never got from any of the previous ones, perhaps because I felt they had a greater significance in the game. They were not essential, but they were enjoyable to acquire and you were rewarded in a well-balanced manner."

I'm on my first playthrough and I lost my main character around hour 10 of 20ish. I would have liked a save to reload at that point. I've since picked up a 3rd party mod/save tool to avoid catastrophic failures. The aiming reticule is on the small side and zoom is underpowered. Despite these issues, it's been a blast. I'm not normally a zombie fan, but the combination of strategy, missions, first-person shooter/beat-em-up is great."
104,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"An absolute great strategy game! Having played every single other war game (European Escalation and Albion), I have to say this one fits well. The number of units is great. Not sure exactly how many units there are, but there's a crap ton! Graphics are just beautiful, sounds are great, and the gameplay overall is epic. The in-game chat box at the main menu is very entertaining, as well. However, if anyone thinking this game is 'easy', or if you're new to the strategy genre, it could take you quite some time to get it nailed down. Don't get upset, you'll lose a lot of units. Just make sure you plan ahead, always have anti-air, and anti-tank."

The game has a glitch where it prompts you to update the terms of service, but clicking ""accept"" doesn't work. You need to restart the client for it to function. While it's not a major issue, I'm concerned about linking my Steam and Gface accounts. They claim it's for DLC, but I don't see why that's necessary. Moreover, it's not reversible, so now I know a company I don't care about has access to my Steam information. The game itself is unoriginal, easily recognizable as a Call of Duty clone, except they somehow managed to make the gunplay worse."

However, be aware that there is considerable dialogue, which can be skipped. I recommend using a gamepad, but the keyboard and mouse setup worked seamlessly, with both controls fully customizable. The price is reasonable, and I wouldn't have been disappointed with a purchase. Over half the DLC is included at no extra cost, providing ample gameplay. I highly recommend this game to JRPG, anime, and visual novel fans, provided you can tolerate occasional breaks between action sequences."
110,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"I experienced no performance issues at release, and after numerous patches, the game plays exceptionally well. In my opinion, this is a truly great and enjoyable game, with a few minor drawbacks. The format may be somewhat inconvenient, particularly in the free-roam city area, where the environment repopulates with new enemies upon progressing the story. I particularly enjoyed the 'dual play' segments, where you can play as Batman and another character, and the option to use the controller for most parts of the game, while using the mouse and keyboard for the tank combat sections was greatly appreciated. Driving the Batmobile around the city, including when chasing the APC commanders, is actually quite enjoyable once you master the braking technique to navigate around corners."
111,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"The bottom line is a damn fine fps shooter. It looks, sounds, and plays great, with great fps mechanics, a nice story, cool characters, flawless voice acting, and a badass soundtrack. Not for the faint of heart, though - some cutscenes were pretty darn cruel and vivid. However, when a game is this great, it's easier to spot the flaws, and here they are as I saw them  no SLI support - what a weird issue. I had to put the game away until I upgraded my card, as it ran too poorly on my old dual GPU GTX 590. Make sure you have a fairly decent single GPU card. Stupidly small obstacles are often unclimbable."
112,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"The game's graphics have been set in a comic-like style, with very slick visuals and nice color schemes. The graphics can be set to ""high"" without straining your system. I run the game on an i5 Pentium processor, with an Nvidia GeForce 710M card and 8GB of memory, and it runs smoothly on Windows 8.1. The controls are also flexible, allowing for play with a keyboard and mouse or an Xbox controller."

But don't buy this game thinking it's like CD Projekt, Battlefield, or any other shooter game. It's a game in its own class and should be treated as such. I can't tell you how many times I've heard new players complain about getting killed really fast. Oh, god forbid you get shot in the face and die. It's not like that doesn't happen in real life or anything. I've been playing this game for a while now, throwing all kinds of money at it. One of the best multiplayer games around. A good thing to play when you're not feeling CS GO."
114,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"I'm two hours in and I'm dying from laughter from this game. The gameplay is solid, the art design is beautiful, the music is surprisingly high-quality and fitting, and the story/world has me hooked. The puzzles are fun, but the best part is the comedy. If you've played any RPG since the dawn of video game RPGs, you'll laugh at the various jokes, parodies, and references. If you're new to RPGs, you'll still enjoy the game for its humor. If you played Final Fantasy 7 or X, you absolutely need to play this game. I had to stop playing after two hours to give my cheeks a break from laughing and smiling so much. What a delight so far."
115,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"I'm truly sorry to say, but I tried to be supportive of free-to-play games and indie developers, but I simply didn't enjoy this game. The description sounded right up my alley, but the execution fell short for me. I love puzzle and exploration games, but I found this game to be completely unintuitive, and even after looking up how to progress, I still just simply didn't find the gameplay itself engaging. It also lacks a pause button, which is a critical oversight, especially considering that many sequences in the game are timed. I feel like this game is a lot more cutscene than it is game, and I often find myself simply sitting around waiting for something to happen."
116,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"This game was an incredible experience from start to finish. It was absolutely beautiful, with a story that drew me in and graphics that kept me engaged. The story wasn't just a narrative, but it felt like I was the character, trying to unravel the mystery of what was to come next. The gameplay was excellent, and I learned a lot about myself through this game, particularly about my fear of heights, which I never had a problem with until the ice caverns. My gut was churning the whole time, but I persisted for Uncle Fred! If you guys created a DLC or second game, I would be the first to buy it and recommend it to everyone I know. Thank you to everyone involved in making this, you created an absolutely beautiful game."
117,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Sid Meier's Civilization  Beyond Earth is a turn-based game where you build your civilization to a specific goal or 'victory'. In this game, you're set in the future on a mission to colonize a new planet. I enjoy the 2K approach, which added new mechanics like the affinity system and orbital layer. However, the game can be overwhelming at times. To improve this, incorporating new artwork, such as the environment when communicating with another leader, could be beneficial."
118,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Great game! It offers tons of replayability and is very fun, a zombie survival game! In my top 5 zombie games ever played. After playing 60+ hours, I can honestly say this is one of the better, more realistic zombie games. It's very much designed like a survival horror, as you must save up your ammo, heal your own wounds when you bleed out, take pills when you're infected, etc. I find zombies to feel very natural to be well animated, for a free-to-play game. I would recommend getting one or two friends to play with, but the community is super friendly, and you can usually make friends/talk with the people in the chat or over voice comms."
119,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"It's a shame I can't thoroughly recommend or enjoy this game, as from the short time I've played it, I know I'd be addicted if it didn't have the following two game-breakers. No Aussie servers - one red bar puts you at a severe disadvantage, and creates unbearable lag. I played through the offline training mode and it was stuttering and lagging as well (how does that even happen?). Couple that with the poor ping, and it just ruins the game. Everything is artifacts like crazy - the menus, backgrounds, training, and in-game. I've never had this happen before with this card, and thought it might not like my OC."
120,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"I recently completed this game, and while it may not be particularly deep or engrossing, the storytelling is what truly stands out. The atmosphere is richly detailed, and the many collectibles do an excellent job of fleshing it out. I learned a lot about the world of Batman, which was a pleasant surprise. Although it was a bit disappointing that there were so few boss battles, there are certainly enough future games to rectify that. The combat is moderately challenging, but it's more on the easy side. Leveling up Batman wasn't particularly satisfying, but the gadgets you acquire and upgrade during the campaign add a nice layer of depth to the gameplay. The ability to access previously unreachable areas is a nice touch, providing a sense of progression."
121,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"To the moon is no mere game; nay, it is a veritable experience, and it was one of the best of my life at that. Telltale's The Walking Dead is sad? Hohoho! Well, it's no match for to the moon! Never before have I been so depressed yet fulfilled over something purely fictional. This masterpiece represents the pinnacle of storytelling in my opinion, and the soundtrack is a gorgeously charming and perfect accompaniment. Yes, the controls are a bit finicky, and the gameplay is not the strong point, but the story is so fantastic that I did not care one bit. Plus, the humor is great, and it definitely does not intrude upon the distinguished nature of the story."
122,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Bastion is a brilliant game with a great storyline. After a calamity, you start rebuilding on the bastion, with many choices to give you an advantage. You choose what to build, what weapons to use, what power-ups for those weapons, and what drinks for a bonus effect. The art style and music are fantastic, making the game visually stunning. The narration is based on your actions, so if you pick up a weapon, the narrator will comment on your choice."
123,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"I originally acquired this game in its early development phase, when the primary currency was spacebux and the tech tree was non-existent. At this stage, the game was enjoyable. All the weapons were equally overpowered, eliminating the issue of balance; any player could kill anyone at any time. Additionally, the game provided unlimited gun slots and five loadouts. One might expect that for a game with 'billions of guns', they would at least provide more than six weapon slots and three loadouts before requiring additional purchases. I once had approximately three pages worth of weapons, and was planning new ideas for more, as I found it enjoyable."
124,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"This game was a delightful surprise. One often sees glowing reviews of certain products that can be misleading. In this case, the reviews reflect the fun of this charming little game. It's an intriguing blend of a classic 2D platformer and a MOBA, and it pulls it off with style. I found myself enjoying characters that I wouldn't typically enjoy in other MOBA games. I had expected this trait to continue, but decided to give a melee tank a try anyway. I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome and ended up trying out more as they were unlocked from playing games. The art style and interface is charmingly unique. As such, I now use one of the characters as my avatar and a wallpaper from creating a card set for the game."
125,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"I recently discovered a game that has captivated me, and I find myself engrossed in it for hours on end. The immersive experience is unparalleled, with the music setting the tone, sound effects precisely calibrated, and controls finely tuned. I eagerly anticipate each combat encounter, which is expertly executed. Initially, I had reservations about the naval combat system, but I now find it thrilling to unleash havoc on multiple fleets at once. The only way to lose is to fail to retreat. If the combat appears overwhelming, simply retreat, regroup, and counter-attack. Thank you to the developers for crafting an exceptional experience."

While fans of the original series may be upset at the change to their beloved character, it's certainly for the better; and this new game by Ninja Theory proves it. The game serves as the perfect point for newcomers to jump into the series. It shows the origins of an arrogant, cynical Dante, and it chronicles his journey from cynicism to selflessness."
127,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Where do I start on this absolutely beautiful game? It's story is absolutely charming, with so much detail put into it, and it is a bundle of happiness, bad puns, and annoying dogs, secrets. The character design is on point, with various characters having various personalities and secrets to them. It stands out from other RPGs because you don't have to kill anyone, which is an unused concept in RPGs."
128,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"I'm recommending this solely because it's free, and it might be a more enjoyable experience for others. As for my experience, the game did nothing for me. Half the story relies on shock factor. I wasn't shocked nor emotionally moved in any way by this. Maybe I'm desensitized, or maybe it was too simple to warrant a reaction out of me. The other half of the game tries to paint a picture of a person in mental decline. It deals with obsession, hallucinations, depression, and a few other things."
129,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Do I even need to explain why Portal is amazing? Portal is a puzzle game that presents a concept, then takes it away. It's an engaging way to test your mind while still being enjoyable. Although this game isn't as story-driven, it gave birth to one of the most popular games of 2011. I still play this game when I'm feeling bored and I love to come back and see what gave birth to a legend and what is a legend. The gameplay is quite simple  use portals to your advantage, along with buttons that activate a part of the puzzle."
130,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"If you can overlook the bugs, which I personally only had two  one minor and the other quite annoying, I can definitely recommend this space exploration game. I'll include my specs for reference  i5 6600k, Radeon RX480, Z170 Pro - Gaming, 16GB DDR4 RAM, and a price tag of ~650â‚¬. This setup is definitely within the medium price range."
131,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Remember the age of mythology? Yeah, it's been that long since there's been an RTS game of such quality. Divinity  Dragon Commander reaches awfully close to these borders of my personal most favourite RTS game. Combine this with a huge risk-like grand strategy mode and there, it hits the spot. I am not overly biased due to the fact that this game allows you to turn into a dragon, aiding your troops by supporting, attacking, and even commanding unit production, direction, and spawning at the very same time. Honestly, I do like the complicated RTS games nowadays. Think of Civ V and so on. However, such games attempt to cram complex mechanics, charts, and resources all into one complicated game mode."
134,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"I've had this game for a relatively short period, but in that brief time, two DLCs have been released, along with patches that have transformed an already impressive game into an outstanding one. The developers are highly active in the community, which is evident in the various discussion forums and developer diaries. While there is a considerable learning curve to the game's mechanics, this breadth of strategy allows for a multitude of ways to achieve goals and capitalize on certain situations. In my opinion, the game is almost infinitely replayable. I find myself fully immersed in every session I play, regardless of how the play-through unfolds."
135,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Warframe is a fun game for the first few hours of play. After those few enjoyable hours, you'll begin to see that the game's content is repetitive in its combat, enemies, and gameplay. The one major high point is that the developers are working hard and do semi-frequent updates, which generally include a lot of content, such as sweeping changes, new Warframes, and other tweaks and features. It's a good game to play casually."
136,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"This game is somewhat disappointing. I purchased this game because I thought it was a PC version of ""Katamari Damacy,"" a popular and enjoyable PS2 game. Unfortunately, it's far from it. In this game, you progress by absorbing increasingly larger objects to grow bigger and absorb even bigger things. However, the gameplay isn't as smooth as it could be, and the levels lack inventiveness, with a surreal horror show that leaves me feeling rather depressed and questioning whether being alive is all it should be. Every living creature in this game, from small pets to human beings, makes me wonder if the creators of this game had an interest in taxidermy."
137,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"I'm a keen observer of politics, and when I first learned about this game, I was intrigued. I thought, ""Ah, a simulator of the road to becoming president! That sounds engaging!"" However, it didn't quite live up to my expectations. The game begins by asking you to choose a side  Republican or Democrat, with no independent or third-party options available. I was a bit disappointed, but still optimistic, I decided to continue playing to see what I could do. I'll give the game credit where it's due, the character customization, although limited, is enjoyable to experiment with. It's the only time it's an option to wear your head or not in a campaign, literally."
138,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"The Fallout 3 story is marred by the presence of settlements, which can hinder the experience to the point where you'll find yourself baby-sitting them instead of playing the story. Some keys are hard-coded and cannot be rebound. Bugs abound. My Pip-Boy disappeared permanently at one point and I had to research console commands to get it back. You don't have to work for power armor; it's essentially given to you from the beginning of the game, and power cores are abundant in trader shops. The value of power armor is diminished greatly from previous Fallout games. The story is mediocre, with everything about this game being average except for its stability, which is significantly better than Fallout 3. It doesn't crash every 10 minutes like Fallout 3, making it a more stable experience. Is it better than Fallout 3? No. Is it better than New Vegas? No. The title was overhyped for how bad it actually is."

What I liked  - visuals up until the last level (ice caves) - story is not that great, but the ending (after the closing credits) kind of made me not regret so much spending my time playing this game. What I disliked  - visuals in the last level are uninteresting - gameplay in the last level gets much harder, making it become a frustrating experience of having to do a lot of things over and over again until you get it right."

143,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"It's not difficult for me to see why others enjoy this game, but it wasn't for me. For one thing, I have a preference for playing room-sized games with controllers. Beyond that, the game's awe-inspiring scale is initially impressive, but I felt that same scale hindered my enjoyment. The learning curve and the time it takes to do anything interesting at the start were too great for me."
144,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"My favorite first-person shooter of all time is hands down. Run-and-gun rambos are not necessary. Recoil and ballistics are realistic. Single hits to the chest, neck, or head from rifle-caliber weapons almost always result in death unless they just graze you. Rounds drop over distance and short, controlled bursts are required to remain on target. There is no magical ammunition pool. If you reload half-way through your magazine, you'll have a pouch full of half-full mags. You can't run forever. If you sprint for a while, your aim will suffer as you gasp heavily until you've caught your breath. Rest your weapon on your elbows while prone or on a window sill to steady your aim. Accuracy suffers when standing."
145,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Let me start by saying I didn't purchase Eu when it first came out, and I got it on sale, which included Ew, so I never experienced the issues some people claim to have had with that game. I loved the game, however, it was unforgiving in the early stages, but rewarding when you did things right. As for XCOM2, I love it; the game plays well on medium for me, running a GTX560 with 2GB of VRAM. Initially, the game set it to high, and it was running a bit sluggishly, but not to the point of being unplayable. When I dropped it down to medium, it smoothed out."
146,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"This game offers a wide variety of ship types, featuring physics-based movement for both ships and projectiles/missiles. The resource management is easy to learn and understand. While it may not be perfect, the game has some enjoyable moments. The game starts off quickly and maintains a good pace. Although there's a limited selection of equipment and leveling skills, it still feels like there's always something new to unlock or level up. The best way to enhance the game is through mods, which add new content and variety to the game. The main focus is on the fight for survival, but the big battles for resources are also very engaging."

Among this family, we identify a tracking solution with a single parameter to control simultaneously the fidelity of the transfer, the population of the excited state, and robustness. We define a measure of the robustness of an ultra-high-fidelity transfer as the minimum percentile deviation on the pulse areas at which the infidelity rises above 10^-4. The robustness of our shaped pulses is found superior to that of Gaussian and adiabatically-optimized pulses for moderate pulse areas."

We show that all local minima share the same form of structure that partially identifies the component centers of the true mixture, in the sense that each local minimum involves a non-overlapping combination of fitting multiple Gaussians to a single true component and fitting a single Gaussian to multiple true components. Our results apply to the setting where the true mixture components satisfy a certain separation condition, and are valid even when the number of components is over- or under-specified. For Gaussian mixtures with three components, we obtain sharper results in terms of the scaling with the separation between the components."

However, helicity selection rules for the diboson scattering amplitudes set an obstruction to the naive interference contributions of dimension-six operators, causing the total diboson rate correction's leading contribution to cancel. In this case, measuring the azimuthal decay angles ""resurrects"" the interference, recouping sensitivity to the non-interfering operators. We explore these signatures in detail, finding that the EFT uncertainties associated with higher-dimensional operators are uniquely well-suppressed by the construction of an asymmetry variable, which is only generated by these non-interfering operators, relegating the effects of higher-dimensional, interfering operators to the same status as statistical errors in this observable."

We propose that this current accurately represents the baryon current at low energies.

Consistent with the scikit-learn API, direpack estimators can be seamlessly integrated into statistical and machine learning pipelines."
233,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,paper_abstract,"The nonlinear fluorescence emission has been widely applied for high spatial resolution optical imaging. Here, we studied the fluorescence anomalous saturating effect of the nitrogen vacancy defect in diamond. The fluorescence reduction was observed with high power laser excitation. It increased the nonlinearity of the fluorescence emission, and changed the spatial frequency distribution of the fluorescence image. We used a differential excitation protocol to extract high spatial frequency information. By modulating the excitation laser's power, the spatial resolution of imaging was improved approximately 1.6 times compared to confocal microscopy. Due to the simplicity of the experimental setup and data processing, this method is expected to be used for improving the spatial resolution of sensing and biological labeling with defects in solids."
234,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,paper_abstract,"When random effects are correlated with sample design variables, the standard approach of employing individual survey weights (constructed to be inversely proportional to the unit survey inclusion probabilities) no longer produces asymptotically unbiased inference. We construct a weight-exponentiated formulation for the random effects distribution that achieves unbiased inference for generating hyperparameters of the random effects. Our approach contrasts with frequentist methods that rely on numerical integration, revealing that only the Bayesian method achieves both unbiased estimation with respect to the sampling design distribution and consistency with respect to the population generating distribution. Our simulations and real data example demonstrate the utility of our approach across different modeling formulations and sampling designs."

The reduced symmetries of these emerging materials give rise to inhomogeneous electron, optical, valley, and spin responses, as well as novel properties, including ferroelasticity, ferroelectricity, magnetism, spin-wave phenomena, large nonlinear optical properties, photogalvanic effects, and superconductivity."
236,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,paper_abstract,"Orientational dynamics in the isotropic phase of a comb-shaped nematic polymer with mesogenic and functional side groups was studied using the Kerr effect and dielectric spectroscopy. It was found that in a mesogenic polymer, unlike low-molecular-weight mesogens, the relaxation of the electric birefringence of a melt above the temperature of the nematic-isotropic phase transition can be presented by a sum of several exponential processes, with two playing a decisive role. These main processes replace each other in a temperature range of about fifty degrees. Dielectric spectroscopy also enabled the distinction of two processes of orientational relaxation  the first is due to the rotation of side mesogenic groups, and the second is associated with the motion of main chain segments."
237,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,paper_abstract,"Deep hashing methods have shown great retrieval accuracy and efficiency in large-scale image retrieval. Optimizing discrete hash bits is always the focus in deep hashing methods. A common strategy in these methods is to adopt an activation function, e.g., sigmoid or tanh, and minimize a quantization loss to approximate discrete values. However, this paradigm may lead to more and more hash bits stuck into the wrong saturated area of the activation functions, and never escape. We call this problem ""dead bits problem."" Besides, the existing quantization loss will exacerbate dbp as well. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective gradient amplifier, which acts before activation functions to alleviate dbp."
238,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,paper_abstract,"We study the phenomenology of a hypercharge-zero SU(2) triplet scalar, whose existence is motivated by two-step electroweak symmetry-breaking. We consider both the possibility that the triplets are stable and contribute to the dark matter density, or that they decay via mixing with the standard model Higgs boson. The former is constrained by disappearing charged track searches at the LHC and by dark matter direct detection experiments, while the latter is constrained by existing multi-lepton collider searches. We find that a two-step electroweak phase transition involving a stable triplet with a negative quadratic term is ruled out by direct detection searches, while an unstable triplet with a mass less than 230 GeV is excluded at 95% confidence level."
239,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,paper_abstract,"This paper demonstrates that the eccentric debris rings surrounding the stars Fomalhaut and HD 202628 are narrower than expected in the standard eccentric planet perturbation scenario, also known as the pericenter glow. The standard scenario assumes an initially circular and narrow belt of planetesimals at semi-major axis a, whose eccentricity is increased to ef after the gas disc has dispersed by secular perturbations from an eccentric planet, resulting in a belt of width 2ae_f. In a minor modification of this scenario, narrower belts can arise if the planetesimals are initially eccentric, which could result from earlier planet perturbations during the gas-rich protoplanetary disc phase."
240,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,paper_abstract,"An electron is usually considered to possess only one type of kinetic energy, but could it have more, potentially due to its spin and charge, or by exciting other electrons? In one dimension (1D), the physics of interacting electrons is captured well at low energies by the Tomonaga-Luttinger-liquid (TLL) model, yet little has been observed experimentally beyond this linear regime. Here, we report on measurements of many-body modes in 1D gated-wires using a tunnelling spectroscopy technique. We observe two separate Fermi seas at high energies, associated with spin and charge excitations, together with the emergence of three additional 1D'replica' modes that strengthen with decreasing wire length."

It is likely that the globular cluster system of our galaxy has followed a similarly intricate formation path. To constrain this formation path, we explore the link between the globular clusters and the known merging events that the Milky Way has experienced. We combined the kinematic information provided by Gaia for almost all galactic clusters, with the largest sample of cluster ages available after carefully correcting for systematic errors. To identify clusters with a common origin, we analyzed their dynamical properties, particularly in the space of integrals of motion. Our results show that about 40% of the clusters likely formed in situ."

Two physical RC systems based on a single magnetic skyrmion memristor (MSM) and 24 spin-torque nano-oscillators (STNOS) were proposed and modeled to process image classification tasks and nonlinear dynamic system prediction, respectively. Based on our micromagnetic simulation results on the nonlinear responses of MSM and STNOS with current pulses stimulation, the handwritten digits recognition task demonstrates that an RC system using one single MSM has outstanding performance on image classification. Additionally, the complex unknown nonlinear dynamic problems can also be well solved by a physical RC system consisting of 24 STNOS confirmed in a second-order nonlinear dynamic system and NARMA10 tasks."

We identify a surprising consequence of popularity-based rankings  the fewer the items reporting a given signal, the higher the share of the overall traffic they collectively attract. This few-get-richer effect emerges in settings where there are few distinct classes of items, and items are ranked based on their popularity. We demonstrate analytically that the few-get-richer effect emerges when people tend to click on top-ranked items and have heterogeneous preferences for the classes of items. We analyze how the strength of the effect changes with assumptions about the setting and human behavior."
245,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,paper_abstract,"Weight pruning has been widely acknowledged as a straightforward and effective method for eliminating redundancy in deep neural networks (DNNs), thereby achieving acceleration on various platforms. However, most pruning techniques are essentially trade-offs between model accuracy and regularity, leading to impaired inference accuracy and limited on-device acceleration performance. To solve this problem, we introduce a new sparsity dimension, namely pattern-based sparsity, which comprises pattern and connectivity sparsity, and becomes both highly accurate and hardware-friendly. With carefully designed patterns, the proposed pruning approach consistently achieves accuracy enhancement and better feature extraction ability on different DNN structures and datasets, and our pattern-aware pruning framework also achieves pattern library extraction, pattern selection, pattern, and connectivity pruning, and weight training simultaneously."

Constructing a more closely matched control group by matching a subset of the overall control group to the treated group may result in less bias. We study this phenomenon in simulation studies. We study the effect of mountaintop removal mining (mrm) on mortality using a difference-in-differences analysis that makes use of the increase in mrm following the 1990 clean air act amendments. For a difference-in-differences analysis of the effect of mrm on mortality, we constructed a more closely matched control group and found a 95% confidence interval that contains substantial adverse effects and small beneficial effects."

This can be done through visual predictive checks (VPC), consisting of (1) several reproductions of the original study by simulation from the model under evaluation, (2) calculating estimates of interest for each simulated study and (3) comparing the distribution of those estimates with the estimate from the original study. This procedure is a generic method that is straightforward to apply, generally."

We discuss how similar protocols, relying both on repeated quantum measurements and dynamical decoupling control pulses, enable us to confine and protect quantum dynamics from decoherence in accordance with the zeno physics. This allows us to analytically predict the probability that a quantum system is transferred into a target quantum state by means of stochastic sequential measurements. We also discuss the optimal reconstruction of environmental noise sources by orthogonalizing in the frequency domain the filter functions driving the designed quantum-sensor. The achievement of these tasks will enhance our capability to observe and manipulate open quantum systems, thus bringing advances to quantum science and technologies."

286,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"I recall the most embarrassing moment in my years as a palliative care physician. It occurred a couple of years ago. I was consulted by a woman in her 70s, a retired English professor, who had pancreatic cancer. She was experiencing pain, nausea, and vomiting. During our consultation, she inquired about whether medical marijuana might help her. I reflected on everything I had learned in medical school about medical marijuana, which didn't take long because I had learned absolutely nothing."
287,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"For the past 24 years, I have been a firefighter in Huntington, West Virginia. As a firefighter, my team and I are tasked with saving lives and property from disasters such as car wrecks, house fires, and life-threatening medical emergencies. I am a woman leading a department in a male-dominated profession. Ten years ago, I decided to increase my medical knowledge and I received a nursing degree. This was because it became clear that the next big threat facing not only my city, but other cities around the country, was not the one-and-done disaster, where you can ride in like the cavalry, as a firefighter, put out the fire and leave, feeling like you have made a difference and everything is okay."
288,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"Where does all the carbon we release go? Carbon works in a natural cycle, present in all living things  in the soil, in the oceans, in the atmosphere, and in rocks deep underground. When plants and other living things die, much of their stored carbon makes its way back to the atmosphere until new plants grow and reabsorb the carbon. Over millions of years, some of the carbon stored in ancient trees and sea life becomes rock, and some becomes fossil fuels  coal, oil, and natural gas. Natural events like volcanic eruptions release some of the carbon trapped in rock. However, human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, also release a significant portion of that prehistoric carbon. Today, humans release around 60 times more carbon than all the volcanoes on the planet each year."
290,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"These are challenging economic times, fellow entrepreneurs, challenging economic times indeed. I'd like to lift your spirits by sharing an inspiring, albeit lesser-known, commercial success story from the past two decades. Comparable to the achievements of Microsoft or Google, it's an industry that has weathered the current recession with remarkable resilience. I'm referring to organized crime. Organized crime has a long history, as you may say, and these words of wisdom are well-timed. However, over the past two decades, it has experienced an unprecedented surge, now accounting for roughly 15% of the world's GDP. I like to call it the global shadow economy, or the McMafia, for short. So, what sparked this extraordinary growth in cross-border crime?"
292,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"What is a parent? It's not an easy question. Today, we have adoption, stepfamilies, and surrogate mothers. Many parents face tough questions and tough decisions. Shall we tell our child about the sperm donation? If so, when? What words to use? Sperm donors are often referred to as ""biological fathers,"" but should we really be using the word ""father""?"
293,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"When I gaze into the mirror today, I behold a justice and education scholar at Columbia University, a youth mentor, an activist, and a future New York State Senator. I see a man who spent a quarter of his life in state prison, a six-year sentence that began as a teenager on Rikers Island for an act that nearly cost a man his life. Yet, what propelled me from that darkness to this moment wasn't the punishment I faced as a teenager in adult prison or the harsh realities of our legal system. Instead, it was a transformative learning environment that introduced me to possibilities I never thought were within my grasp or our justice system's reach. A few weeks before my release on parole, a counselor encouraged me to enroll in a new college course being offered in the prison."
294,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"What do you think when you look at me? A woman of faith, an expert, maybe even a sister, or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist, or just an airport security line delay? That one's actually true. If some of your perceptions were negative, I don't really blame you. That's just how the media has been portraying people who look like me. One study found that 80% of news coverage about Islam and Muslims is negative. And studies show that Americans say that most don't know a Muslim. I guess people don't talk to their Uber drivers."
295,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"We need to build a weather service for water. However, until we collectively demand accountability, the incentives to fund it will not exist. My first speaking engagement was at a TED conference eight years ago. Fresh out of graduate school, I was unaware that in those few minutes onstage, I was framing the questions I would be asked for the next decade. Like many 20-somethings, I expected to solve the world's problems, particularly the world's water issues, with my technology. I had a lot to learn. It was seductive, believing that our biggest water quality challenges persist because they're so hard to identify. I assumed that we just needed simpler, faster, and more affordable sensors. I was wrong."
296,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"Indeed, for 20 years, I worked in finance, and I was certain about finance. I knew the global economy like the back of my hand. All topics that you could bring up about ecology, the end of the world, etc., I knew like the back of my hand. In 2007, an event occurred, the subprime crisis, the collapse of big American banks. It was an electric shock. I had a few stormy conversations with my wife about the matter, on the limits of the model. Besides the crisis, I realized that I was wrong, that we were heading for disaster."
297,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"So, I'll be speaking to you using language because I can. This is one of the magical abilities that we humans possess. We can transmit complex thoughts to one another. As I'm speaking, I'm making sounds with my mouth as I exhale. I'm creating tones, hisses, and puffs, and those air vibrations are traveling to you, hitting your eardrums, and your brain transforms them into thoughts."
298,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"I'm drawn to a quote by Jello Biafra, an activist and punk rock musician, which resonates with me  ""Don't hate the media. Be the media."" As an artist, I appreciate working with media and technology because I'm familiar with their capabilities and the immense power they wield. However, I also fear the potential for abuse of this power. I recall a striking interview in 2003 between Tony Snow, a Fox News host, and Donald Rumsfeld, then-US Defense Secretary. They discussed the Iraq invasion, and Rumsfeld's response to a question about the number of civilian casualties was telling  ""We don't do body counts on other people."""
299,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"Baking an apple pie? A fruit's a fruit, right? It's 1988, and scientist James Hansen has just testified to the United States Congress that global warming trends are caused by human activity, and will pose an increasing threat to humanity in the future. Looking for a wedding dress? Try a new take on a timeless classic."
300,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"Someone once said that politics is, of course, ""showbiz for the unsavory."" So, on that basis, I feel like I've really arrived. The other thing to consider is what an honor it is, as a politician, to give a TED Talk, particularly here in the UK, where the reputation of politics, following the expenses scandal, has sunk so low. There was even a story recently that scientists had thought about replacing rats in their experiments with politicians. And someone asked, ""Why?"" and they said, ""Well, there's no shortage of politicians, and no one really minds what happens to them, as there are some things that rats just won't do."""
