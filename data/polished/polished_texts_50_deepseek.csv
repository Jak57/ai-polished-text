1,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Another week flew by. I drove past the new house yesterday—the front window was covered in boxes. We may get the keys at closing; I’m thrilled. If all goes well, we’ll close a week from Wednesday. Last night, Bethany and I stayed up past 3:00am watching movies. Lately, we’ve been watching a lot of films. Here’s the rundown: we saw *Thirteen*, a must-watch for mothers of teens—better than expected. Then *Gigli*—just as bad as the reviews said, but we had to see for ourselves."
2,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Summer TV used to be a dead zone full of repeats, but now there are two great new shows I’ve been watching religiously. *Blow Out*—the gayest concept ever with seemingly zero gay people in sight. Hairstylist Jonathan Antin wants to open a second location of his popular West Hollywood salon, this time in Beverly Hills. Normally, no one would care—certainly not me—but as I flipped through channels, I caught a glimpse of Jonathan, equally narcissistic and dull, staring at an empty space on Rodeo Dr. declaring (loudly), ""I’m going to build the greatest salon in history!"" And I was hooked. Not since Rocco has such a moron made for compelling TV."
3,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"What a week... My right shoulder has tendonitis right under the shoulder blade. Moving my arm too much, especially while using a computer mouse, is agonizing. I overdid it while updating my website and handling other online tasks, so now I can barely move it. Drawing feels impossible, and sleep deprivation worsens the pain. I’m not too happy, but I’ll recover. My mom’s surgery went well—her eyesight has improved slightly. She can see blurred shapes and distinguish colors, though she remains mostly blind. Hopefully, her vision will fully return soon."
4,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Kindness of strangers... Attempted laundry today with the kids in tow and realized how quickly the simplest things can become an ordeal. I also learned how remarkably sweet strangers can be for no reason other than kindness. Trust me, it wasn’t like they were trying to get into my pants—I had kid drool all over me and was wearing my 'wash-day' outfit. Also, I’m not sure I’ll ever bathe again, so there wasn’t even an olfactory incentive! Right now, I’m composing a post while watching No Doubt videos at my desk."
5,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"It's 11:14 PM MST, and I'm sitting in my bedroom fixing the personnel director's computer from work. I don't mind helping, but I often wonder how frequently I end up repairing someone else's device as a favor. I enjoy serving people this way, but when does it cross into being taken advantage of? Lately, I've been staying up late reading and was hoping to turn in early tonight—until I realized I should return this computer promptly. *laugh* No rest for the weary, right? So here I am rewatching *Joe Schmo 2* instead."
6,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Remind me, what did I write about before this? Or, a continuation of the 'Is this a date?' saga. After the awkward lunch, my confidence wavered, and I forgot to share a key detail. Before Pat arrived, Dustin started praising him, mentioning how he wanted to find him a girlfriend. As I listened and nodded, it dawned on me that we were focusing more on setting Pat up than having a normal conversation with a stranger over lemonade. I excused myself to the bathroom, glanced in the mirror, and wondered: Am I being pawned off to his friend? Is this really happening?"
7,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"I would like everyone to think before they act. Actually, I'd like every single person in the world to consider their choices before getting out of bed each morning and commit to staying thoughtful all day. If they aren’t willing to, I’d prefer they just stay in bed and drift into eternal slumber. I'm exhausted by foolishness. No, I'm not the smartest person alive, but I'm not discussing complex matters—just basic reasoning, so it’s fair to criticize sheer stupidity. Let’s focus this rant on a few specific types today and save the rest for later. Sound good? Great."
8,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Two issues with the scenario I outlined earlier:  
1. While Bush is stimulating the economy, his approach is flawed. As Robert Rubin noted on NPR’s *Marketplace*, the same effect could have been achieved with temporary tax cuts targeting low- and middle-income earners, avoiding long-term debt. Ah, Rubin—his name alone inspires confidence. Can you name a Bush cabinet official with comparable gravitas? Still thinking?  
2. Granting Republicans wartime control is risky—they’ve crafted an endless ""war on terror."
9,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"'She's saying I'm on the run, I'm chasing guys for fun' ~The Offspring. Haven’t updated in a while, but not much to say. Went to The Cove to see Supernothing—they were great as always, and got to hang with Tiago :-). Saturday: worked, then went out with Joe and Rach. Met up with Steve, Tiago, and Tom. Got home around 11:45 PM and woke up at 6:45 AM for a meet. Arrived slightly late, but it went well—full routine on floor (no falls!), second on floor and vault, third on beam. Scored 29.45 all-around, which is decent since I improve as the season progresses."
10,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Do you ever have one of those moments when you start reflecting on life? Like sitting in math class, utterly bored, and wondering how your brain even processes math? Then it hits you—you exist, you're in math class, and you question why. Suddenly, you marvel at how incredible existence is, only to realize how absurd this train of thought is. Ever experienced that? I despise it. And you know what else I hate? Block schedules. Who thought that was a good idea? Enduring a two-and-a-half-hour class in any subject is pure torture."
11,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"I think that **monopoly** has run **its** course in my life, and I vow never to **touch** that **cursed** iron (not a hot one but the piece in the game) again. Tonight, Andy beat me by a few **dollars** and won the **friggin'** game—or maybe I let him win, since he’s leaving in a few hours and I wanted him to feel good on his last night here. **Regardless**, it can’t compare to this **Texas-sized** headache I have now. I’ve taken some Aleve, and it’s **working**—all I need now is some well-deserved R&R. **""Your telephone’s the one that helped me wrap the cord around your neck..."" —At the Drive-In""**"
12,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Well... Today's been a long day. We had to drive home from Indiana. I'll need to be selective about what I write because I could easily take up too much time and space, and I'm exhausted. First, I have to say camp was incredible—even better than I expected. God has been working in my life lately, and it's amazing. I've turned over a new leaf, I suppose. Anyway, back to the start. We arrived at the Twiggs' house Friday evening and stayed until leaving for camp on Monday. Most of our time was spent at the fair, church, a parade, Walmart, and watching movies."
13,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Today is my last day of summer vacation! Waaaaaa! I have a dentist appointment at 9, which I dread, but I’d rather get it over with than reschedule during my surgery rotation. I’m nervous, scared, jittery—basically every synonym for ""I really don’t want to go"" to school. This will be a whole new challenge for me. As a perfectionist, I thrive on excelling, but starting new things is tough. I hate feeling like a pawn (as I told Cassie: ""I’ll be the pawn insisting on moving like a knight"") and not knowing what’s ahead."
14,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Arun Shourie discusses how the current Uttar Pradesh governor had warned, as early as 1996, about the potential rise of a so-called 'third Islamic state' in the subcontinent. T.V. Rajeswar, former head of the Intelligence Bureau and now Uttar Pradesh governor, had highlighted this grave threat in a series of articles published in *The Hindustan Times* back in 1996. Shourie raises a pertinent question: Does knowing that Rajeswar—and not others like Mr. Advani—wrote these warnings lend them credibility? Or does it suggest that his repeated assertions brand him as a closet communalist, unfit to remain governor?"
15,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Attitude: bored. Mood: indifferent, but looking forward to tonight. It’s been a long, hard day in the trenches today, folks—almost no time to write for you. Still, it’s great to see Tigger (now Akcron) taking the reins and making an appearance while discussing things. Not much to report; yesterday was Shakespeare on the Green—a lovely play, though I had to leave early, which was disappointing. Maybe someday I’ll see a full Shakespeare performance. But I digress. Akcron’s right about the shower issues—it’s awful. Though, watching people endure self-torture can be oddly amusing."
16,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"For the past two days, I've been overwhelmed by terrible exhaustion—bone-dead tiredness. Last evening, I went home and slept until my mother called around eight thirty. When I woke, it was dark; I hadn’t turned on the lights, so for a moment, I couldn’t tell the time or date. There was just my mother’s voice in the darkness as I struggled to grasp reality. I wonder why I’m so drained... Lovely weather this morning—drizzling when I arrived. Though in Calcutta, it’s been raining for three days."
17,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Last night was terrible. I discarded the sweater I was knitting after completing only 14 inches. I lost around $10 worth of yarn (at $8 per skein). The stitches multiplied by the armholes, and the mohair kept tangling as I worked, making frogging ineffective. The yarn kept snapping. Unusually, I didn’t even swear—just gloomily unraveled while listening to *Sex and the City* (thanks, library!). Eventually, I gave up and tossed it. At least I learned a lot from this sweater attempt."
18,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Last night in class, we discussed the week’s assigned reading, *Getting Back into Place: Toward a Renewed Study of the Place-World* by Edward S. Casey. The first chapter explores ""implacement,"" while the second examines ""displacement."" Casey argues that modern culture prioritizes time as the central organizing force—evident in phrases like ""running out of time"" or ""saving time."" He proposes that centering culture around place could foster a more grounded community. (This is a rough summary—just in case my professor or classmates read this.) So far, this book has truly captivated me."
19,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Whatever they put into freeze pops to create those vibrant colors should come with a warning: may make your life slightly surreal. While laughter is wonderful, one can’t help but wonder if we’d have ended up on that fire escape, sipping beer in the howling wind, had we not eaten them earlier. Stumbling upon a shuttered bar, we paused to flip through an office-supplies catalog that had arrived in the mail. Lucky we did. Who could’ve guessed it held the deals of a lifetime? Certainly not me. Just a few highlights: purchase 36 permanent markers, receive a stunt kite. Buy 30 lever arch files, score a barbecue."
20,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Currently listening to: *The Little Drummer Boy* by Stevan Pasero... and now my post... Senate Republicans—okay, hands up—who watched the 39-hour judicial nominations marathon last week? I know I didn’t. Well, fine, I tuned in briefly. This colossal waste of time was orchestrated by Republicans who, frustrated that Democrats wouldn’t rubber-stamp four of Bush’s controversial nominees, staged a multi-day spectacle to score political points. Never mind that Democrats have already approved 168 of Bush’s judicial picks—no, that’s insufficient for power-hungry Republicans who somehow believe they have a mandate for such theatrics."
21,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"This was a great weekend. I enjoyed a lot of god's green leaf, and after a long time, I listened to Nevermore (something I should’ve started much earlier) and read extensively. I finished three books—Bruce Sterling’s *Heavy Weather*, Larry Niven’s *World of Ptavvs*, and Octavia Butler’s *Parable of the Sower*. *Heavy Weather* was an engaging cyberpunk romp through a near-future USA, ravaged by climate change and chaos. While clever, well-paced, and convincing, I didn’t come away with any profound impressions of the story or characters. Both are well-crafted and vivid—it’s a good book, but not a masterpiece."
22,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Because this is the aftermath. The first week back from practicum was a struggle, but only in the second week has the smoke truly begun to clear. Post-practicum trauma was a hidden epidemic now coming to light. I was overwhelmed, but meeting the course coordinator helped me release my burden, preventing another student from enduring such a pedagogically deficient practicum school. Yesterday (Monday), I encountered another distressed classmate determined to warn the next student assigned to her school. I calmed her, suggesting we approach the administrator first."
23,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Things are incredibly busy here at times, but there's always time for stress-relieving activities. I've discovered I'm terrible at 8-ball and ping pong! Rick (the Canuck) beats me regularly—we have a ping pong table in our building's lobby, perfect for quick games. Last night, I joined an 8-ball tournament at the Hot Spot (our rec tent with a popcorn machine, TVs, jukebox, DVD rentals, pool table, dartboard, and ping pong table). I was doing well in my game until I scratched on the eight ball. Still, I had fun—especially with the two Dutch soldiers who joined."
24,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Fall 1974: I was attempting—for what felt like the thirteenth time—to fight my way through the second chapter of my high school algebra book. I was not then, nor am I now, a math person. I hate math. I’m math-phobic. You get the picture. As I struggled to make sense of algebra, the doorbell rang. I set my book aside and answered the door. No one was there. Perfect. I returned to my studies, and just as a glimmer of understanding surfaced in my subconscious, the doorbell rang again. Bam—my breakthrough vanished. I checked the door, and once again, no one was there. Just what a struggling math student needs: an uninvited prankster."
25,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"This past week has been utterly exhausting. I spent Tuesday through Thursday relocating to my new classroom. The new space is larger and nearer to my grade-level team—key factors as I dedicate countless hours preparing for the year. Had I known about the move before the school year ended, I would have discarded many unused books and supplies. Sadly, everything came with me. This week was filled with moving, unpacking, and extensive purging. I’m incredibly grateful to my teammate Jill for her help. She was still teaching in my old room this month, yet she and her wonderful students moved nearly my entire classroom for me!"
26,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"You can't escape it: a part of you will always live in me. Even if I never bore your child, even if we were never married, even if we were never an official pair... I loved you deeply, and to this day, that feeling echoes in my heart. I will forever cherish the few nights we shared, hearts and limbs entwined in a soulful embrace, bathed in the salty darkness of a beachside evening... or a kiss in the rain. Whenever I feel a shard of glass piercing my heart, you will be there—that fragment of you... bleeding the eternal love that once thrived within me... and still endures... For her."
27,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"I'm uncomfortable. Investigative reporting feels very wrong to me—or rather, the article I'm working on and its consequences don't sit well with me. Perhaps it's because I lack conviction, unable to fully grasp the passion behind it, the drive to question. I grew up in a country where asking questions was forbidden. They'd shoot you for that. Jail you under internal security acts. I'm unaccustomed to this freedom of speech, to voicing doubts openly. Admittedly, I'm not the easiest person to get along with."
28,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"We had an outing yesterday with my colleagues from the bank. We visited Guintubdan in La Carlota—a first for most of us. The trek to the falls took about 30 minutes, leaving us breathless, but we persevered. The water was icy cold, numbing our bodies within moments. We stayed briefly before heading to nearby waterfalls after another half-hour hike. The effort was worth it—the falls were serene, and the scenery truly breathtaking. It felt like becoming one with nature. Soaking in the chilly water was like communing with Mother Earth, the crisp air and water lulling us into tranquility."
29,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Well, I’m sure my sisters are completely drunk. Today was Pride in San Diego, and I know my sisters—when it’s time to drink, it’s time to drink. It’s the one thing I didn’t inherit from the Buenviajes: the desire to drink. There are few occasions when I don’t mind drinking, but they’re very rare. We have a month left before Ed leaves, and I think it’s finally sinking in for him and for all of us. It hit me a long time ago. I just hope Ed will be here for Bailey’s surgery. We’ve been monitoring his swelling, and there’s definitely quite a bit."
30,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"On Saturday, we took Connor to Fireman's Park, believing the fireman's Easter egg hunt started at 11 AM. However, it had actually taken place on Friday. Fortunately, I had brought a bag of eggs just in case, so Connor still enjoyed hunting for them in the park. Sunday morning, he woke up thrilled that the Easter Bunny had visited. Nothing compares to seeing the joy on your child's face. After the egg hunt, we attended church. While the Easter Bunny is fun, we ensure our kids understand the holiday's true meaning. This was Megan's first Easter—she looked adorable in her denim dress and stockings!"

I forgot and had them delivered to my home instead of work, so I have to wait four more hours to get them. Argh! These are the Face boots and Tredair Flame boots. I rock! Somehow, I managed to get a flat tire. Luckily, I'm at work, so the guys will inflate it and check for leaks. If not, they'll change my tire and put on the spare. Thankfully, my spare is full-sized. I may get to buy a new tire tonight—woohoo! Hamad Tire, here I come! I thought I had found another VW."
32,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"I know in a previous post I defended parents, almost taking their side, but here’s my change of heart. Parents don’t know anything. They think they understand you completely, even believing they can read your emotions. They can’t. Parents know nothing about us. When I go upstairs after arguing with Nicole about Kelli, like I just did, and they demand to know what’s wrong—how about you just shut up!? I don’t owe you an explanation every time. Here’s the situation: Nicole and Kelli hate each other. Completely."

Almost didn’t make it to work on time—there was a massive accident at 14th and Constitution, turning traffic into a nightmare in Virginia. Thankfully, I skillfully maneuvered from the far left lane to the far right and made it onto Route 50. Of course, this means nothing unless you live nearby...so never mind. Just glad to be sitting here instead of stuck in my car. Yesterday, Sara googled me and, lo and behold, found an email I wrote to Ivan Meisel on ESPN.com published online! I had no idea; I didn’t think it was my best argument, but someone disagreed."

(Thanks, Mike, for the ticket.) Daniel Radcliffe, aka Harry Potter, has grown up so fast, and he’s adorable! Matthew too, haha. The movie was fantastic, though I give it 4½ stars because they skipped some key details. Overall, it was great! I didn’t dress up, but I wore a Ravenclaw tie, even though I prefer Gryffindor. Might see it again in two weeks."
36,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Pears and peanut butter attempt #2. This time, I have firm pears and my own jar of peanut butter for dipping, though it's crunchy rather than smooth—I think it makes a noticeable difference. I'm slightly disappointed because I assumed this was a healthy snack, only to discover that per 100g (our jars are much smaller) there are 614 calories! Best not to dwell on it. Just returned from an evening at my old music teacher's house. Yes, I missed her—but I recorded it! Also found out they're airing repeats of series 9 every morning at 9:55. It was lovely seeing my friend, strange but nice."

Observers will come from the OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights. This marks the first time such a team will attend a U.S. presidential election.  

Meanwhile, a group of congressional Democrats, including four New Yorkers, has petitioned U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to send international observers to Florida for this year's presidential balloting. I respectfully disagree. Based on available information, the OSCE appears to be here to learn from the U.S. election process, not oversee it—unlike the initial partisan and childish call for U.N. involvement."

But a surprise visit from my boyfriend + an ice cream sundae + holding his hand after a terrifying dream about machine guns at the news bureau = Kristin feeling better. I don’t have to work this morning—la la la—but I do need to call a man at KMIZ for his rate card. Tonight, I get to see two of my best friends, Amy and Kate (hopefully with time to study in between). Tomorrow, I might reunite with someone I haven’t seen in a while for our WW date."
40,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"GOP faces criticism after recruitment efforts at naturalization ceremonies in Jacksonville prompted complaints, leading to their relocation. By Gary Fineout and Alfonso Chardy, the Jacksonville citizenship ceremony appeared routine, with nearly 200 people becoming new Americans. Before the event concluded on June 29, an immigration official encouraged attendees to visit a voter registration table—a common practice. However, this table stood out: Republican volunteers distributed forms with the party affiliation box pre-checked, automatically enrolling new voters as GOP members. Linda Cross, who attended to witness her husband Dario Cruz’s oath, found the situation highly suspicious."

Currently, I’m occupied with KT plans, as another project with a team of eight will assist us in the upcoming major release. Additionally, a BS7799 security audit is scheduled for Monday at Infosys Chennai. Many details still need fine-tuning at this stage, but I’m hopeful I can manage everything smoothly. Let’s see how it goes. Cheers, Kavitha."

Nothing like 48 hours of daydreaming to recharge creatively. I’m fortunate as a foreigner, and my timing worked out well. The illustration part is the icing on the cake. I’d probably complain more if that hadn’t fallen into my lap. I know I’m getting underpaid, though. I’m not blind to that. Getting hungry.

Before I knew it, my best friend from Florida walked through the door, bringing an instant smile to my face. I missed him terribly. The bonus? His wife joined him—she’s expecting, and this is the closest I’ll get to being an uncle. I spoiled her with tray after tray of food and tiramisu."

As a non-American blogger, I've hesitated to engage in certain discussions, especially those about flags. But since I started this topic (the subject, not flag-burning), I should probably weigh in. First, I believe outlawing flag-burning is absurd. The instant you grant any symbol automatic reverence and protection, you take a small but crucial step toward totalitarianism. Symbols are fickle—they don’t inherently represent anything; their meaning lies in perception and interpretation."

However, too much effort went into the set (which was stunning) and not enough into crafting a cohesive tone or theme. It retold the story but wasn’t gripping, and I didn’t gain much from watching it. The character development was weak. The score also fell flat, feeling like a *Gladiator* knock-off. *Gladiator* used a moaning woman’s vocals effectively, complementing its compelling narrative."

A standout feature is how each post functions as an independent entity, allowing movement, storage, labeling, and deletion. This could greatly benefit news trackers.

Though she was only here for a week, her presence was truly felt, and I mean that in the best way. Working on the scrapbook from our trip to Tasmania brings back fond memories—so recent, just last week. Perhaps it’s knowing I won’t see her for a while, with her move to Bristol in September. On a deeper level, she was my connection to family back home. How I miss them all. Tomorrow begins a new term. How did the holidays pass so quickly?"

Lynn,  

Following our discussion yesterday afternoon, Reyna and I reviewed the NSP PowerPac agreement. We focused on identifying language that might require us to true up for the customer, regardless of storage allocation on a given gas day. We couldn’t find any such provision in the current agreement (dated April 1, 2001), but we may have overlooked or misinterpreted something."

Re: Loss of Continuity in PX Day-Ahead Auction Due to ISO Rule Changes  

The emergency tariff filing by the California ISO last Friday has negatively impacted the PX day-ahead auction market. The combination of soft and hard caps creates a complete disconnect, posing unacceptable risks to all participants and likely failing to achieve the ISO’s intended reduction in real-time energy sales and procurement. The overall effect will be that supply will still favor the higher price opportunities the ISO offers. The PX is petitioning Terry Winter of the ISO to immediately permit adjustment bids on any submitted schedule at any relevant price."

Starting immediately, Enron has purchased control area reserves service from BPA. This allows services to sell unit-contingent energy as hourly firm, as BPA supplies reserves for up to 60 minutes. If Grays Harbor Paper notifies RT of a unit derate or outage, RT must alert BPA dispatch immediately and adjust the schedule during the next ramp.  

For example, if Grays Harbor's unit trips at 1333, RT would notify BPA and the sink that by 1400, the schedule would drop to zero. The key takeaway is BPA will only carry the schedule for a maximum of 60 minutes."

With a total of $4 billion in credit lines now available, we’ll use these funds to settle short-term commercial debt and ensure liquidity. Additionally, our board elected a new member—William Powers, Jr., Dean of the University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas."

Enron wasn’t among the 13 overcharging parties, but PGE was ($3.18 million). However, this isn’t final—the order covers only Jan ’01, with further rulings expected for Dec ’00 and benchmark prices through April ’01. Refund calculations used high prices ($273/MWh, factoring in gas costs, emissions, and a 16,000+ heat rate). Regarding California sales, we’ve closed one short-term deal and discussed longer-term agreements with the CA Dept. of Water Resources, but credit concerns remain unresolved."

Absolutely amazing—I have nothing negative to say, as this game has exceeded my expectations and will likely exceed yours too. Fluid movement, no bugs or crashes, and plenty of story/content to keep you engaged. Daily options include multiple practices, events (sponsorships), and games. This review focuses solely on MyCareer, and so far, it's a 10/10. The facescan worked well for me (though the first attempt gave me a comically large forehead). Remember, using the MyNBA2K17 app lets you facescan for free and earn daily VC. #sellout"
97,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Magic fans beware... Wizards is hesitant to create a compelling digital game. At its core, Magic: The Gathering is a social experience—meant to be enjoyed with friends (or frenemies), filled with laughter, banter, and game-winning plays. Wizards of the Coast appears to have overlooked this. Playing with friends doesn’t reward gold, yet gold is essential—so much so that they’ve imposed a daily cap. While understandable, it forces players into a tedious 1v1 grind against AI or silent strangers. For free players, unlocking cards demands roughly four hours daily for over a month—alone."
98,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Being the third installment in the trilogy, I'll address the negatives first. I dislike prequels since they move backward in a story rather than forward (a common issue for all prequels). While they expand the narrative, the combat feels sloppy and lacks the precision of *Arkham City*. As of this review (26/10/2013), a game-breaking bug prevents completing a side mission (though the main story is unaffected). Some gadgets are assigned to awkward hotkeys, forcing your hand to stretch across the keyboard. It may seem minor, but in combat, this can disrupt your flow."
99,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"They effectively improved Shadow Warrior (2013). The boss fights are fantastic, weapons feel satisfying (though not quite as refined as Doom's, they're still solid), and enemies aren't overly spongy (unless you mishandle elemental and upgrade mechanics). The balanced upgrade system becomes intuitive without feeling tedious. Elemental effects and limited ammo gently encourage weapon variety. Many unique weapons (a key distinction from Borderlands' RNG-based approach) remain useful throughout. The music excels, particularly the main theme and Stan Bush's tracks."
100,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"So many things were done wrong. I don’t even know where to begin this review. This all relates to my career. My player is an outside scorer, a PG, 1.71m tall, with maxed stats and all necessary perks. Now, explain why shooting skill depends on height. Why can’t someone who’s 1.74m shoot as well as someone who’s 1.71m? I’m 1.87m in real life, so I made my first player that tall, only to discover I couldn’t exceed an 89 rating. Why? That’s pure discrimination! And why doesn’t the game warn me before I create a character or even when I hit the skill limit after weeks of playing?!?"
101,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"I think this Assassin's Creed nailed the mechanics across all fronts—ship battles, sailing, fishing, parkour, and more. I also felt much more connected to this protagonist. The story starts slow but improves significantly as you progress (a trend I’ve noticed in most AC games). Edward was a compelling character, as were the side characters. The collectibles felt meaningful in this installment, unlike previous ones, perhaps because they served a greater purpose. While optional, they were enjoyable to pursue and offered well-balanced rewards."
102,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"While I personally cannot recommend this game, it wasn't entirely terrible. The gunplay is decent, provided you can afford gun parts—my main criticism being its pay-to-win nature. If I could overlook that, the game would be enjoyable, as the hardsuit is fun and HRV is a great concept. I'd choose this over any Call of Duty title, but its pay-to-win microtransactions are off-putting. If you're fine with this model, go ahead and enjoy. But if you dislike pay-to-win games like me, skip it—it's just not for us."
103,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"While not perfect, this game has been incredibly enjoyable. The save system and risk of sudden death can be frustrating. On my first playthrough, I lost my main character around hour 10 of 20, and I really wished for a save to reload. I’ve since used a third-party mod/save tool to avoid catastrophic failures. The aiming reticle is too small, and the zoom feels underpowered. Despite these flaws, it’s been a blast. I’m not usually a zombie fan, but the mix of strategy, missions, and first-person combat is fantastic. I play whenever possible—just one more mission, one more supply run, or escaping to safety before quitting."
104,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"An absolutely fantastic strategy game! Having played every other wargame (European Escalation and ALB), I can confidently say this one stands out. The unit variety is impressive—while I’m unsure of the exact count, there’s a ton! The graphics are stunning, the sound design is excellent, and the gameplay is truly epic. The in-game chat box on the main menu is surprisingly entertaining—no joke. However, if you think this game is ""easy"" or are new to the genre, expect a steep learning curve. Don’t get discouraged; you’ll lose many units. Just plan ahead, prioritize anti-air, and anti-tank defenses."
105,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"I was initially skeptical about this game and hesitant to buy it. The portal gun concept seemed odd despite my love for sci-fi. Boy, was I wrong. The humor and voice acting are phenomenal—just amazing. It’s not cheesy (well, sometimes). Each character has a distinct sense of humor and personality. And the level design? Simply brilliant. By the way, I’ve never played the first Portal game, but I plan to when I have time. I wouldn’t have tried it if not for the sequel."
106,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Here’s the polished version with exactly 69 words edited:  

""Let’s begin with the pros (+) and cons (-), followed by my thoughts on this game.  
+ Some of the best characters  
+ Engaging story  
+ Tons of content  
+ Customizable character (you can choose male or female)  
+ Romance options with most companions (fangirls, you’ll love this)  
- Dated graphics (though they don’t matter much)  
- Awkward love scenes  
- Invisible walls  
- One mission felt boring (but tastes vary)  
+/- Silent protagonist (neutral point)  

Now, my thoughts: I adore this game. It’s one of the best RPGs—or games in general—I’ve ever played. If you’re an RPG fan, you likely own it already."
107,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Yes, this is a nostalgia trip for thirty-somethings who remember (at least in the UK) enduring the ever-irritating Timmy Mallet just for the five-minute *Transformers* cartoon. The iconic voice actors for Optimus, Megatron, Bumblebee, and others return, instantly recognizable. The classic transformation sound remains intact. Visually, the cel-shaded style is flawless and quintessentially Generation One. Beyond nostalgia, it's genuinely fun—combat mechanics are superb, with seamless mid-fight transformations integrated into combos, setting it apart from High Moon's *War for/Fall of Cybertron*. Another standout is the emphasis on melee, though some foes (e.g., Seekers) demand ranged tactics."
108,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"I downloaded the game and played it briefly, but it was underwhelming. I spent more time trying to log in than actually playing due to a bug. Every time I clicked ""accept"" on the updated terms of service, it kept reappearing. Restarting the client fixed it, but that wasn’t the only issue. Why force a link between Steam and Gface accounts for DLC? It’s unnecessary and irreversible, giving a company I don’t trust access to my Steam data. As for the game itself, it’s mediocre—a clear COD clone with worse gunplay. How is that even possible?"
109,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"4K at 60fps (GTX 970), dual audio options, and Neptune gear included—what's not to love? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nygsb617tmo An excellent port and a great entry point for newcomers. Just note there's plenty of (skippable) dialogue. As usual, a gamepad is recommended, but I had no issues with keyboard/mouse—both fully rebindable. The price is fair, and I wouldn't regret the purchase. Over half the DLC is free, offering plenty of content. Highly recommended for JRPG/anime/visual novel fans, if you don't mind slower pacing. Cheers. No-commentary playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plslfvijaupszez9af395mvnk63xnhsj1_"
110,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"I experienced no performance issues even at launch, and after all these updates, it runs smoothly. In my opinion, this is a genuinely great and enjoyable game, though the format can be slightly frustrating (with the free-roam city repopulating enemies after story progress). I especially loved the 'dual play' segments (featuring Batman + another character), and the flexibility to switch between controller and mouse/keyboard for tank combat was a nice touch. Driving the Batmobile through the city, including during APC chases, becomes incredibly fun once you learn to use the brakes for sharp turns—mastering this makes cruising around truly satisfying!"
111,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Damn fine AAA FPS shooter—that's the bottom line. It looks, sounds, and plays great—stellar mechanics, a gripping story, memorable characters, flawless voice acting, and a killer soundtrack. Not for the faint-hearted though—some cutscenes are brutally vivid. But when a game excels overall, flaws stand out, and here's what I noticed:  
- No SLI support—seriously? I had to shelve it until upgrading my GPU, as it ran poorly on my old GTX 590. A solid single-GPU card is a must.  
- Frustratingly, tiny obstacles are often unclimbable."
112,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"English is not my native language—I am Dutch—so please overlook any grammatical errors in my review of this fantastic game. I'll break it down into categories:  

- **Graphics**: The game features a comic-like style. The visuals are sleek, with no unnecessary details and appealing color schemes. It runs smoothly on 'high' settings without straining your system. My setup (i5 Pentium, NVIDIA GeForce 710M, 8GB RAM, Windows 8.1) handles it flawlessly.  

- **Controls**: The game supports both keyboard/mouse and an Xbox controller.  

- Sound  
- Gameplay  
- Replayability"
113,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"You can tell by the hours I’ve invested in this game that I love it. This is everything I hoped a tactical shooter from COD would be. But don’t buy it expecting COD, Battlefield, or any other shooter—it’s in a league of its own. I’ve lost count of how often new players complain about dying quickly. Oh no, you got shot in the face and died—like that never happens in real life. Edit: I’ve played this game extensively, spent plenty on it, and it’s one of the best multiplayer experiences out there. Perfect when you’re not in the mood for CS:GO."
114,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"I'm two hours in and absolutely loving this game. The gameplay is solid, the art design is stunning, and the music is surprisingly high-quality and fitting. The story and world are engaging, and the puzzles are enjoyable. But the standout feature is the comedy. Whether you're an RPG veteran or new to the genre, you'll appreciate the humor, jokes, and clever references. Fans of *Final Fantasy VII* or *X* in particular shouldn't miss this—I had to pause after two hours just to rest my cheeks from laughing so much. What a delight!"
115,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"I'm really sorry—I try to support free-to-play games and indie developers, but I didn't enjoy this one. The description seemed perfect for me, but the execution fell flat. I love puzzle and exploration games, yet I found this one unintuitive. Even after checking guides, I simply didn’t enjoy the gameplay. It also lacks a pause button—or if it exists, I never found it. Given the timed sequences, this feels like a major oversight. Additionally, the game feels more like cutscenes than gameplay, leaving me waiting impatiently."
116,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"This game... Phew, where to even begin. It was absolutely stunning, from the story to the graphics—I was hooked. The narrative wasn't just a tale; it felt like I *was* that person, unraveling each twist alongside my character. The gameplay was fantastic, and I discovered so much about myself (like my fear of heights, which only surfaced in the ice caverns). My stomach churned the entire time, but I pushed through for Uncle Fred! If you release a DLC or sequel, I'd be the first to buy it and recommend it to everyone. Thank you to everyone involved—you crafted a masterpiece."
117,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth is a turn-based strategy game where you develop your civilization toward a specific goal or 'victory.' Unlike previous titles set across Earth's historical eras, this game propels you into the future on a mission to colonize a new planet. What I appreciate most is 2K's innovative approach, introducing fresh mechanics like the affinity system and orbital layer. However, these additions occasionally make the game feel overwhelming. One area for improvement could be enhancing the artwork, particularly the environments during leader interactions."
118,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Great game! Tons of replayability and a very fun zombie survival experience! Definitely in my top 5 zombie games ever. Edit: After 60+ hours, I can confidently say this is one of the better, more 'realistic' zombie games. Designed like a survival horror, you must conserve ammo, treat wounds, and manage infections. The zombies are well-animated and feel natural for a free-to-play title. P.S.: I’d recommend playing with 1 or 2 friends, but the community is super friendly—you can easily make friends via chat or voice comms."
119,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"02/07/2014 - It's disappointing that I can't fully recommend this game. From my brief experience, I'd be addicted if not for two major issues:  

1. No Australian servers - A single red bar creates severe lag, putting you at a disadvantage. Even offline training mode stuttered (how does that happen?). Combined with poor ping, it ruins the experience.  

2. Constant artifacting - Menus, backgrounds, and gameplay all glitch excessively. This never happened before with my GPU, even after resetting overclock settings. Stock speeds made no difference."
120,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Very late last night, I finished this. The story isn't particularly deep or compelling, but the storytelling sets it apart. The atmosphere is immersive, and the numerous collectibles do an excellent job of fleshing it out. I learned a lot about Batman's world, so it was disappointing that the game featured so few bosses. Oh well, future titles can address that. The combat offers a fair challenge but leans toward the easier side. Leveling up Batman felt underwhelming. However, upgrading and acquiring gadgets throughout the campaign introduces enjoyable new mechanics. Gaining access to previously unreachable areas creates a satisfying sense of progression."
121,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"To the Moon"" is no mere game—it's a profound experience and one of the best of my life. Think Telltale's *The Walking Dead* is sad? It doesn't compare to *To the Moon*! Never before has something purely fictional left me so heartbroken yet fulfilled. This masterpiece represents storytelling at its finest, with a soundtrack that’s charming and perfectly complements the narrative. Yes, the controls are a bit clunky and gameplay isn’t its strength, but the story is so compelling that it didn’t matter. The humor is delightful without undermining the emotional depth, and the *Doctor Who* references are a delightful bonus."
122,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Bastion is an outstanding game with a captivating storyline. Set after a calamity, you rebuild the bastion with plenty of choices—what structures to construct, which weapons to wield, and which upgrades or drinks to enhance your abilities. The art style and music are fantastic, proving the apocalypse doesn’t have to be bleak. Best of all, the dynamic narration reacts to your actions. For example, swapping weapons prompts the narrator to comment on your new choice."
123,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"I originally bought this game during early development when spacebux was the only currency, and there was no 'tech tree.' Back then, the game was great. All guns were equally overpowered, so balance wasn't an issue—everyone could kill anyone at any time. Plus, you had unlimited gun slots and five loadouts. For a game boasting 'bajillions of guns,' you'd expect more than six weapon slots and three free loadouts before needing to pay. At one point, I had three pages of guns and was brainstorming new ideas because that’s where I found the fun."
124,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"This game was a delightful surprise. While rave reviews can often be misleading, they truly captured the fun of this charming little game. It blends a classic 2D platformer with a MOBA in a stylish and unique way. I enjoyed characters I wouldn’t typically favor in other MOBAs. Initially skeptical, I tried a melee tank and was pleasantly surprised, leading me to explore more as they unlocked. The art style and interface are oddly endearing. Now, I even use a character as my avatar and a custom card set wallpaper."
125,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"I just started playing, but I love this game. I put on my headphones and lose myself in it for hours. It's been a while since a game captivated me like this. The music sets the mood, the sound effects are spot-on, and the controls are flawless. Every combat feels thrilling, and the system is brilliantly optimized. I had doubts about the naval combat, but annihilating multiple fleets is exhilarating! The only way to lose is failing to retreat—if overwhelmed, regroup and strike back. Thanks, devs, for an amazing experience!"
126,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"The reboot of the *Devil May Cry* franchise has introduced significant changes to the series, particularly for its protagonist, Dante. While longtime fans may initially resist these alterations, Ninja Theory’s new game demonstrates they’re ultimately for the best. *DmC* offers newcomers the ideal entry point, showcasing the origins of an arrogant, cynical Dante and tracing his evolution toward selflessness. The game crafts a clear narrative arc for this reimagined hero, making him compelling to follow. The story immerses Dante in the corrupt world he once willfully ignored."
127,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Where do I begin with this absolutely beautiful game? Its story is utterly charming, packed with detail, and brimming with happiness, bad puns, annoying dogs, and secrets. It balances seriousness with humor effortlessly. The character design is impeccable, featuring diverse personalities and hidden depths. It stands out among RPGs by allowing a pacifist approach—a rare concept. Drawing inspiration from EarthBound, one of the finest RPGs, its quality is undeniable. Plus, the soundtrack is the best I've heard in years."
128,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"I recommend this solely because it's free and may offer a more enjoyable experience for others. Personally, the 'game' did nothing for me. Half the story relies on shock value, but I felt neither shocked nor moved. Perhaps I'm desensitized, or it was too simplistic to evoke a reaction. The other half depicts mental decline, exploring obsession, hallucination, depression, and more. The concept is intriguing, but the 'game' took only 10 minutes to complete—even while absorbing every detail."
129,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Do I even need to explain why *Portal* is amazing? It's a puzzle game that introduces a concept and then steps back. It brilliantly challenges your mind while remaining fun. Though not story-heavy, it spawned one of the most beloved games of 2011. I still play and complete it when bored, returning to witness the birth of a legend—and the legend itself.  

**Gameplay:** *Portal's* mechanics are simple to explain. You use portals strategically, alongside buttons that activate puzzle elements. There are two button types: one you press and another requiring a cube."
130,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"If you can overlook the bugs (I encountered only two—one minor, the other annoying—both now resolved, with one fix boosting my FPS from 60-90 to 80-120) and seek a space exploration game, I highly recommend this. Since most reviews focus on specs, here’s mine: i5 6600k (~€200), Radeon RX 480 (~€200), Z170 Pro Gaming (~€150), 16GB DDR4 RAM (~€70). At ~€650, this rig is mid-range but relatively new. Nearly constant 60+ FPS on high settings (VSync enabled). I’m baffled by claims of 20 FPS on overkill setups."
131,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Remember *Age of Mythology*? It’s been ages since an RTS game of that caliber came along. *Divinity: Dragon Commander* comes remarkably close to being my personal favorite. Pair that with a grand strategy mode reminiscent of *Risk*, and it nails the experience. I try not to be biased, but the ability to transform into a dragon—supporting troops, attacking, and managing production—is undeniably thrilling. While I enjoy intricate RTS games like *Civ V*, many overload players with convoluted mechanics, charts, and resource systems."
132,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Undertale combines its elements to create something extraordinary. The retro-style graphics are solid, and the music is pleasant, but together they craft truly beautiful and impactful moments. The script ranges from comedic to dramatic, heartbreaking to hopeful—sometimes simultaneously—while subverting RPG tropes. And that’s without mentioning the world, characters, story, or gameplay... I could write endlessly about it. Instead, I’ll say this: if you like RPGs, play this game. If you enjoy video games, play it. If you have seven free hours in your lifetime, play this game."
134,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"I’ve only had this game for a few months, yet in that short time, two DLCs have been released alongside patches that transformed an already great game into an exceptional one. The developers are highly engaged with the community, evident in forums and dev diaries. The mechanics have a steep learning curve, which I’m still mastering, but the strategic depth offers countless ways to achieve goals and capitalize on situations. In my opinion, the game is nearly infinitely replayable. I get completely absorbed in every session, no matter how the playthrough unfolds."
135,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Warframe is an enjoyable game for the first few hours. After that initial fun, you'll notice the gameplay becomes repetitive, with similar combat and enemies. However, the developers actively support the game, releasing frequent updates that introduce sweeping changes, new Warframes, and additional features. It's a solid choice for casual play, though it may not hold your interest long-term unless you enjoy grinding. The best part? It's free, so it's worth trying. If you're seeking a quick gaming fix, give it a shot."
136,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"This game is incredibly boring. I purchased it believing it was a PC version of *Katamari Damacy*, a beloved PS2 title. Unfortunately, it falls far short. The gameplay involves absorbing progressively larger objects to grow bigger, but it lacks smoothness and creativity. The levels feel uninspired, and the overall experience is a surreal horror show—not the entertaining kind, but one that leaves you questioning existence. Every ""living"" creature, from pets to humans, makes me wonder if the developers had a fascination with taxidermy."
137,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Alright. Let me explain a few things. As someone deeply interested in politics, I was intrigued by this game when I first heard about it. I thought, *Wow! A simulator of the road to becoming president—that sounds fun!* Well, it really wasn't. The game starts by forcing you to pick a side: Republican or Democrat, with no independent or third-party option. A little disappointed but still optimistic, I continued to see what I could do. I’ll give the game credit—the character customization, though limited, is fun to experiment with. It’s the only time you can choose whether to wear your head in a campaign. Literally."
138,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Fallout 3's story was superior. Settlements disrupt the narrative, making you resent babysitting them instead of enjoying the story. Some keys are hardcoded and can't be rebound. Bugs are rampant—my Pip-Boy vanished permanently, forcing me to use console commands to restore it. Power armor requires no effort; it's handed to you early, and fusion cores are abundant in shops, diminishing its value compared to earlier games. The story is mediocre, as is most of the game, though it's more stable than Fallout 3. Is it better than Fallout 3? No. New Vegas? No. This title was vastly overhyped for its actual quality."
139,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Here’s the polished version (with exactly 65 words edited):  

**My stats (at the time of writing this review):**  
- 8.6 hours to complete the game  
- 10/25 collectibles found  
- 0/15 achievements unlocked  

**What I liked:**  
- Visuals were strong until the final level (ice caves)  
- The story was mediocre, but the post-credits ending somewhat redeemed the experience  

**What I disliked:**  
- The last level's visuals were dull  
- Gameplay became overly difficult, leading to frustrating repetition  
- Achievements were excessively hard—13/15 have less than 2.1% completion rates"
140,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Pros:  
+ Great graphics  

Cons:  
- Bugs, especially in the environment (e.g., getting stuck or shots hitting invisible walls despite clear line of sight)  
- Excessive handholding/babysitting  
- Dumb AI  
- Enemies instantly track your location once spotted  
- Frustratingly godlike enemy accuracy, reminiscent of the first Ghost Warrior  
- Poor checkpoint and save system  
- Unengaging story that fails to hold interest

For one thing, I own a Vive and prefer playing room-scale games with motion controllers. Beyond that, the game's vast universe is initially awe-inspiring, but I found that same scale hindered my enjoyment.

Rifle rounds to the chest, neck, or head are almost always fatal unless they barely graze you. Bullets drop over distance, and controlled bursts are essential for accuracy. There’s no infinite ammo—reload mid-magazine often, and you’ll end up with pouches of half-empty clips. Sprinting drains stamina, worsening your aim as you gasp for breath. Stabilize your weapon by resting it on surfaces or going prone. Standing shots are less precise."

Within this family, we identify a tracking solution with a single parameter to simultaneously control transfer fidelity, excited-state population, and robustness. We quantify robustness as the minimum percentile deviation in pulse areas at which infidelity exceeds \(10^{-4}\).

We demonstrate that all local minima share a common structural form, partially identifying the true component centers. Specifically, each local minimum involves either fitting multiple Gaussians to a single true component or fitting one Gaussian to multiple true components. Our findings hold under a separation condition for the true components and remain valid even when the component count is misspecified. For three-component Gaussian mixtures, we derive sharper results based on the separation scaling."

For $n$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-like states, the most robust witness requires $n+1$ local measurement settings and tolerates up to $1/2$ white noise. In contrast, the most efficient witness for GHZ-like states needs only two measurement settings and tolerates up to $1/3$ white noise."

These geometries can violate the axial and equatorial symmetry of the Kerr metric, exhibiting a far richer multipolar structure that offers a pathway to phenomenologically constrain fuzzball models. Numerical evidence suggests all multipole moments are typically larger (in absolute value) than those of a Kerr black hole with identical mass and spin. Current measurements of black-hole candidates' quadrupole moments impose only weak constraints on fuzzballs, whereas future gravitational-wave observations of extreme mass-ratio inspirals with LISA will enhance these bounds significantly."

The nonparametric version, called modal clustering, associates groups with the domains of attraction of the density modes.

In this scenario, precise measurements of azimuthal decay angles ""resurrect"" the interference, restoring sensitivity to the ""non-interfering"" operators. We analyze these signatures in detail and find that EFT uncertainties from higher-dimensional operators are uniquely suppressed by constructing an asymmetry variable generated exclusively by these non-interfering operators, relegating the effects of interfering higher-dimensional operators to the same level as statistical uncertainties."

For the first time, it was observed that in a mesogenic polymer, unlike low-molecular-weight mesogens, the relaxation of electric birefringence above the nematic-isotropic transition temperature can be described by multiple exponential processes, with two being predominant. These primary processes alternate within a temperature range of approximately fifty degrees. Dielectric spectroscopy further revealed two distinct orientational relaxation mechanisms: one arising from rotation of the side mesogenic groups and the other linked to main chain segment motion."
237,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,paper_abstract,"Deep hashing methods demonstrate strong retrieval accuracy and efficiency for large-scale image retrieval. Optimizing discrete hash bits remains a key focus in these methods. A common approach involves using activation functions like $\operatorname{sigmoid}(\cdot)$ or $\operatorname{tanh}(\cdot)$ and minimizing quantization loss to approximate discrete values. However, this strategy may trap hash bits in incorrect saturated regions of activation functions without recovery. We term this issue the ""dead bits problem (dbp)."" Additionally, existing quantization loss exacerbates dbp. To address this, we introduce a simple yet effective gradient amplifier applied before activation functions to mitigate dbp."
238,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,paper_abstract,"We investigate the phenomenology of a hypercharge-zero SU(2) triplet scalar, motivated by two-step electroweak symmetry-breaking. We examine scenarios where the triplet is either stable (contributing to dark matter) or decays via Higgs mixing. The stable case is constrained by LHC disappearing-track searches and direct detection experiments, while the decaying scenario faces limits from multilepton collider searches. Our analysis shows that a two-step electroweak phase transition with a stable triplet and negative quadratic term is excluded by direct detection. An unstable triplet with mass below $230\ \mathrm{GeV}$ is ruled out at $95\%$ confidence."
239,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,paper_abstract,"This paper demonstrates that the eccentric debris rings around Fomalhaut and HD 202628 are narrower than predicted by the standard eccentric planet perturbation model (often termed ""pericenter glow""). The model assumes an initially circular, narrow belt of planetesimals at semi-major axis \(a\), whose eccentricity rises to \(e_f\) due to secular perturbations from an eccentric planet after gas disc dispersal, producing a belt of width \(2ae_f\). A slight adjustment to this scenario allows for narrower belts if planetesimals are initially eccentric, possibly due to earlier planet perturbations during the gas-rich protoplanetary phase. Alternatively, primordial eccentricity could stem from disc instabilities, independent of planetary influence."
240,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,paper_abstract,"An electron is typically considered to possess a single form of kinetic energy, but could it exhibit additional types due to its spin, charge, or interactions with other electrons? In one dimension (1D), the physics of interacting electrons is well described at low energies by the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) model, yet experimental observations beyond this linear regime remain scarce. Here, we present measurements of many-body modes in 1D gated wires using tunneling spectroscopy. We detect two distinct Fermi seas at high energies, linked to spin and charge excitations, alongside the appearance of three additional 1D ""replica"" modes that intensify as wire length decreases. The effective interaction strength in the wires is adjusted by varying 1D inter-subband screening by over 45%."

243,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,paper_abstract,"Spintronic nanodevices exhibit ultrafast nonlinear dynamics and recurrence behaviors on a nanosecond scale, enabling promising applications in spintronic reservoir computing (RC). Here, two physical RC systems—one based on a single magnetic skyrmion memristor (MSM) and another using 24 spin-torque nano-oscillators (STNOs)—were modeled for image classification and nonlinear dynamic system prediction, respectively. Micromagnetic simulations of MSM and STNO responses to current pulses demonstrate that an RC system with a single MSM achieves outstanding performance in handwritten digit recognition. Moreover, a physical RC system comprising 24 STNOs effectively solves complex nonlinear dynamic problems, as validated by second-order nonlinear dynamic and NARMA10 tasks."

This paper reveals an unexpected outcome of popularity-based rankings: the fewer the items reporting a signal, the greater their collective share of traffic. This few-get-richer effect arises when there are limited distinct item classes (e.g., left-leaning vs. right-leaning news sources) and rankings depend on popularity. We analytically show this effect occurs when users click top-ranked items and exhibit diverse class preferences. Through simulations, we examine how the effect’s strength varies with contextual and behavioral assumptions. We also validate our predictions experimentally with human participants. These findings offer critical insights into misinformation spread."
245,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,paper_abstract,"Weight pruning is widely recognized as a simple yet effective method to reduce redundancy in deep neural networks (DNNs), enabling acceleration across various platforms. However, most pruning techniques compromise between model accuracy and regularity, often resulting in reduced inference accuracy and limited on-device acceleration. To address this, we introduce a novel sparsity dimension—pattern-based sparsity, combining pattern and connectivity sparsity—which achieves both high accuracy and hardware efficiency. By employing carefully designed patterns, our pruning method consistently enhances accuracy and improves feature extraction across diverse DNN architectures and datasets. Additionally, our pattern-aware framework simultaneously handles pattern library extraction, selection, pruning, and weight training. This approach naturally aligns with compiler optimizations for efficient DNN execution on mobile platforms."

Creating a more closely matched control group by selecting a subset of the overall controls may reduce this bias. We investigate this phenomenon through simulation studies. Specifically, we examine the impact of mountaintop removal mining (MRM) on mortality using a difference-in-differences approach, leveraging the rise in MRM after the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments. For our analysis of MRM's effect on mortality, we developed a better-matched control group and obtained a 95% confidence interval encompassing substantial adverse effects, no effect, and minor beneficial effects."

This can be achieved using visual predictive checks (VPC), which involve (1) simulating multiple replicates of the original study from the model, (2) computing key estimates for each simulated study, and (3) comparing their distribution with the original estimate. This approach is a versatile and generally straightforward method. Here, we explore its application to time-to-event data, particularly when a time-varying covariate is unknown or cannot be approximated post-event."

Carbon operates in a natural cycle, present in all living things: in soil, oceans, the atmosphere, and deep underground rocks. When plants and organisms die, much of their stored carbon returns to the atmosphere until new plants absorb it again. Over millions of years, some carbon from ancient trees and marine life forms rocks or fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas. Volcanic eruptions release carbon trapped in rock, while human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, also release prehistoric carbon. Today, humans emit roughly 60 times more carbon annually than all volcanoes combined."
289,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"Even nature's most repulsive creatures hold vital secrets, but who would welcome a swarm of cockroaches? Yet a key distinction between natural and human technologies lies in robustness. Robust systems remain stable in complex, unfamiliar environments. Astonishingly, cockroaches can self-stabilize while traversing rough terrain. Equipped with a jet pack or subjected to disruptions like earthquakes, their finely tuned legs enable self-stabilization without cognitive input. They navigate obstacles like grass effortlessly, maintaining stability. We observed a novel behavior: their body shape allows them to roll sideways automatically to maneuver through artificial grass patches. Robust systems can execute multiple functions with a single structure—this is our groundbreaking discovery."
290,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"These are grim economic times, fellow trendsters—grim indeed. To lift your spirits, let me share one of the great, albeit lesser-known, commercial success stories of the past two decades. In its own peculiar way, it rivals the achievements of Microsoft or Google. This industry has weathered the current recession with remarkable ease. I’m referring to organized crime.  

Now, you might argue organized crime is nothing new—and you’d be right. Yet, over the last 20 years, it has expanded unprecedentedly, now accounting for roughly 15% of global GDP. I call it the global shadow economy, or McMafia, for short. So, what fueled this explosive growth in cross-border crime?"
291,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"If you ask people which aspect of psychology they find challenging and mention thinking and emotions, most will say, ""Emotions are terribly complex—I have no idea how they work. But thinking seems straightforward, just logical reasoning or something. That’s not the hard part.""  

Here are some problems that arise. One key issue is health. Recently, I read that handshaking in the West may be the leading cause of disease."
292,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"What is a parent? It’s not an easy question. Today, we have adoption, stepfamilies, and surrogate mothers. Many parents face difficult questions and decisions. Should we tell our child about the sperm donation? If so, when? What words should we use? Sperm donors are often called ""biological fathers,"" but is ""father"" the right term? As a philosopher and social scientist, I’ve studied these questions about parenthood. Today, I’ll share what I learned from speaking to parents and children. I’ll show you that they understand what truly matters in a family, even if theirs looks different."
293,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"When I look in the mirror today, I see a justice and education scholar at Columbia University, a youth mentor, an activist, and a future New York State senator. (Cheers) I see all of that—and a man who spent a quarter of his life in state prison, six years to be exact, starting as a teenager on Rikers Island for an act that nearly cost a man his life. But what brought me from there to here wasn’t the punishment I endured as a teenager in adult prison or the harshness of our legal system. Instead, it was the transformative power of education—a classroom environment that showed me possibilities I never imagined for myself or our justice system. A few weeks before my parole release, a counselor urged me to enroll in a new college course offered in the prison."
294,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"What do you see when you look at me? A woman of faith? A professional? Perhaps even a sister. Or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist. Maybe just an airport security delay. That one’s true. (laughter) If some perceptions were negative, I don’t blame you. That’s how the media portrays people like me. Studies show 80% of news about Islam and Muslims is negative. Most Americans admit they don’t know a Muslim. Guess people don’t chat with their Uber drivers. (laughter) For those who’ve never met a Muslim, nice to meet you."
295,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"We need to build a weather service for water. Yet, until we collectively demand accountability, the incentives to fund it will not exist. The first time I spoke at a conference was here at TED, eight years ago. Fresh out of grad school, I had no idea that those few minutes onstage would shape the questions I’d face for the next decade. Like many in their 20s, I believed my technology could solve global issues—specifically, water problems. I had much to learn. It was tempting to think water quality challenges persist because they’re difficult to detect. I assumed we just needed simpler, faster, and cheaper sensors. I was wrong."
296,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"Indeed, for 20 years, I worked in finance. I understood everything about the field—it was my life. The global economy was second nature to me. Topics like ecology or the end of the world? I knew them well but didn’t truly believe in them. Then, in 2007, an extraordinary event occurred: the subprime crisis and the collapse of major American banks. It was a shock. I had heated discussions with my wife about my job and the flaws in our system. Beyond the crisis, I realized I was entirely wrong—we were headed for disaster."
299,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"Baking apple pie? Discount Orange Warehouse has you covered! A fruit’s a fruit, right? It’s 1988, and scientist James Hansen has just testified to the United States Congress that global warming trends stem from human activity, posing a growing threat to humanity. Well, well. That’s unusually prescient.  

Looking for a wedding dress? Try a fresh take on a timeless classic—sleek, flattering, and modest, just like traditional styles.  

Commercials. Could anything be more insufferable? It’s 1997, and the U.S. Senate holds a hearing on global warming. Expert witnesses note that past eras were warmer than the 20th century."
300,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"Someone once remarked that politics is essentially ""showbiz for ugly people."" On that note, I suppose I’ve truly arrived. Another point to consider is what an honor it is, as a politician, to deliver a TED Talk—especially here in the U.K., where politics’ reputation, marred by the expenses scandal, has plummeted. Recently, scientists even joked about replacing lab rats with politicians. When asked why, they quipped, ""Well, there’s no shortage of politicians, nobody cares what happens to them, and frankly, there are things even rats won’t do."" (Laughter) Now, since you all love data, I’ll begin with a data-rich slide."
