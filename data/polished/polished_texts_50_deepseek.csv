Re: Loss of Continuity in PX Day-Ahead Auction Due to ISO Rule Changes  

The emergency tariff filing by the California ISO last Friday has negatively impacted the PX day-ahead auction market. The combination of soft and hard caps creates a complete disconnect, posing unacceptable risks to all participants and likely failing to achieve the ISO’s intended reduction in real-time energy sales and procurement. The result will be suppliers favoring the higher realized prices offered by the ISO. The PX is petitioning Terry Winter of the ISO to immediately permit adjustment bids on any submitted schedule at relevant prices.""

Effective immediately, Enron has purchased control area reserves service from BPA. This enables services to sell unit contingent energy as hourly firm, as BPA supplies reserves for up to 60 minutes.  

If Grays Harbor Paper notifies RT of a unit derate or outage, RT must alert BPA dispatch immediately and adjust the schedule during the next ramp. For example, if Grays unit trips at 1333, RT would notify BPA and the sink to reduce the 1400 schedule to zero.

At its core, Magic: The Gathering is a social experience—meant for sharing laughs, smack talk, and game-winning plays with friends (or frenemies). Yet Wizards of the Coast appears to have overlooked this. Playing with friends earns no gold, and gold is crucial—so much so that they’ve imposed a daily cap (understandable, as it unlocks everything). But brace yourself for a tedious 1v1 grind against AI or silent strangers. Free players face roughly 4 hours daily for a month, alone, to unlock cards."

""As the 3rd installment in the trilogy, I’ll address the negatives first. I dislike prequels because they move backward in a story rather than forward (a common issue). That said, it expands the lore. The combat feels sloppy, lacking the precision of *Arkham City*. At the time of writing (26/10/2013), a game-breaking bug prevents completing a side mission (main story unaffected). Some gadgets have awkward hotkeys, forcing excessive hand movement—minor, but disruptive mid-combo."
99,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"They significantly improved *Shadow Warrior (2013)*—boss fights are fantastic, weapons feel great (maybe not as refined as *DOOM*'s, but still solid), and enemies aren’t overly spongy (if you handle elemental and upgrade mechanics well). The balanced upgrade system becomes intuitive without being tedious. Limited ammo and elemental effects encourage varied weapon use. Many unique weapons (unlike *Borderlands*’ RNG-based ones) remain viable throughout. The soundtrack shines, particularly the main theme and Stan Bush’s tracks."
102,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"While I personally cannot recommend this game, it wasn’t terrible. The gunplay is decent, provided you can afford upgrades—my main gripe is its pay-to-win nature. If I overlooked that, the game could be enjoyable, as the hardsuit is fun and HRV is a great concept. I’d prefer this over any Call of Duty title, but its microtransaction model is off-putting. If you’re fine with this approach, go ahead and enjoy. But if, like me, you dislike pay-to-win games, skip this one—it’s not for us."
103,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"While not perfect, this game has been incredibly enjoyable. The save system and risk of sudden death can be frustrating. On my first playthrough, I lost my main character around hour 10 of 20. A reloadable save would’ve been ideal. I’ve since used a third-party mod/save tool to prevent catastrophic failures. The aiming reticle is too small, and the zoom feels underpowered. Despite these flaws, it’s been a blast. I’m not usually a zombie fan, but the mix of strategy, missions, and FPS/beat-em-up gameplay is fantastic. I play whenever possible—just one more mission, one more supply run, or escaping to safety before quitting."
104,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"An absolutely great strategy game! Having played every other wargame (European Escalation and ALB), I can confidently say this one stands out. The unit variety is impressive—while I’m unsure of the exact count, there’s a ton! The graphics are stunning, the sound design is excellent, and the gameplay is epic. The in-game chat box on the main menu is surprisingly entertaining—no joke. However, if you think this game is 'easy' or are new to the genre, expect a steep learning curve. Don’t get discouraged; you’ll lose many units. Just plan ahead, always bring anti-air and anti-tank."

The humor and voice acting are phenomenal—truly amazing. It’s not cheesy (well, sometimes). Each character has a distinct sense of humor and personality. The level design is brilliant.

The iconic voice actors for Optimus, Megatron, Bumblebee, and others return, instantly recognizable. The classic transformation sound remains, and the cel-shaded visuals perfectly capture Generation One. Beyond nostalgia, it's a genuinely fun game. Combat mechanics are superb—transforming mid-fight is essential and smoothly integrated into combos, setting it apart from High Moon's *War/Fall of Cybertron*. Another standout is the emphasis on melee, though some foes (e.g., Seekers) demand ranged tactics.""

In my opinion, this is a genuinely great and fun game, though the format can be slightly frustrating (with the free-roam city repopulating enemies after story progress). I especially loved the 'dual play' segments (featuring Batman + another character), and the option to switch between controller and mouse/keyboard for tank combat was a welcome touch. Driving the Batmobile through the city, particularly during APC chases, becomes incredibly satisfying once you learn to use the brakes for sharp turns—mastering this makes cruising around an absolute delight!"

It looks, sounds, and plays great, with solid mechanics, a compelling story, memorable characters, flawless voice acting, and a killer soundtrack. Not for the faint-hearted, though—some cutscenes are brutally vivid. But when a game excels overall, flaws stand out:  
- No SLI support—why? I shelved it until upgrading my GPU, as it ran poorly on my old GTX 590. A decent single-GPU card is a must.

Oh no, you got shot in the face and died—like that never happens in real life. Edit: I’ve played this game for a while now, invested heavily, and it’s one of the best multiplayer games out there.

The narrative wasn’t just a tale; it felt like I was living it, unraveling each twist alongside my character. The gameplay was exceptional, and I discovered so much about myself (especially my fear of heights, which only surfaced in the ice caverns). My stomach churned throughout, but I persevered for Uncle Fred! If you release a DLC or sequel, I’d be the first to buy it and recommend it to everyone. Thank you to the entire team for crafting such a masterpiece."

Unlike previous entries set across Earth's historical timeline, this game takes place in the future as you colonize a new planet. What I enjoy is 2K's fresh approach, introducing mechanics like the affinity system and orbital layer. However, these additions can sometimes feel overwhelming. One potential improvement would be incorporating new artwork, particularly in environments during leader interactions."

Edit: After 60+ hours, I can confidently say this is one of the better, more 'realistic' zombie games. Designed like a survival horror, you must conserve ammo, treat wounds, and manage infections. The zombies feel natural and are well-animated for a free-to-play title. P.S.: I'd recommend playing with 1–2 friends, but the community is super friendly—you can easily make friends via chat or voice comms."

First, the lack of Australian servers means constant lag—even the offline training mode stuttered (how is that possible?). Poor ping ruins the experience. Second, everything artifacts excessively: menus, backgrounds, and gameplay. I suspected my GPU overclock, but reverting to stock settings made no difference."
120,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Very late last night, I finished this. The story isn't particularly deep or compelling, but its storytelling sets it apart. The atmosphere is immersive, and the numerous collectibles do an excellent job of fleshing it out. I learned a lot about Batman's world, though the lack of bosses was disappointing. Still, future games can address that. The combat offers a fair challenge but leans toward the easier side. Leveling up Batman felt underwhelming, but upgrading gadgets throughout the campaign introduces fresh mechanics. Gaining access to new areas creates a satisfying sense of progression."

It pales next to *To the Moon*! Never have I felt so moved by pure fiction. This masterpiece epitomizes storytelling at its peak, with a soundtrack that’s both charming and flawless. Yes, the controls are finicky and gameplay isn’t its strength, but the story is so compelling, I didn’t mind. The humor is delightful, never detracting from the narrative’s depth... And the *Doctor Who* references? Endless."
123,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"I originally bought this game during early development when the only currency was spacebux, and there was no 'tech tree.' Back then, the game was great. All guns were equally overpowered, so imbalance wasn't an issue—everyone could kill anyone at any time. Plus, you had unlimited gun slots and five loadouts. For a game boasting 'bajillions of guns,' you'd expect more than six weapon slots and three loadouts before needing to pay. At one point, I had three pages of guns and was brainstorming new ideas because, for me, that was the fun part."
124,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"This game was a delightful surprise. While rave reviews can often be misleading, here they truly capture the fun of this charming little game. It’s a unique blend of classic 2D platforming and MOBA, executed with flair. I enjoyed characters I typically wouldn’t in other MOBAs. Initially skeptical, I tried a melee tank and was pleasantly surprised, leading me to explore more as they unlocked. The art style and interface are endearing—so much so that I now use a character as my avatar and a card set wallpaper."

It's been a while since a game captivated me like this. The music sets the mood, the sound effects are spot-on, and the controls are flawless. I eagerly anticipate every battle, and combat is brilliantly optimized. I had doubts about the naval combat system, but destroying multiple fleets is exhilarating! The only way to lose is failing to retreat. If combat seems overwhelming, just regroup and counterattack. Thanks, devs, for an amazing experience!"

While longtime fans may lament the alterations to their beloved character, this new iteration by Ninja Theory proves it’s for the better. *DmC* serves as an ideal entry point for newcomers, showcasing the origins of an arrogant, cynical Dante and chronicling his transformation into selflessness. The game crafts a clear narrative arc, making him a compelling character. The story follows Dante as he confronts the corrupt world he once ignored."

The character design is impeccable, featuring diverse personalities and hidden depths. It stands out among RPGs by allowing players to avoid killing—a rare concept.

Yeah, it's been that long since we've seen an RTS game of such quality. *Divinity: Dragon Commander* comes awfully close to being my personal favorite. Combine it with a grand strategy mode akin to *Risk*, and it hits the mark. I try not to be overly biased, but the ability to transform into a dragon—supporting troops, attacking, and commanding production—helps. I enjoy intricate RTS games like *Civ V*, but they often cram complex mechanics, charts, and resources into one overwhelming mode."

136,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"This game is incredibly boring. I purchased it believing it was a PC version of *Katamari Damacy*, a beloved PS2 game. Unfortunately, it falls far short. The gameplay involves absorbing increasingly larger objects to grow bigger, but it lacks smoothness and creativity. The levels are uninspired, and the overall experience feels like a surreal horror show—not entertaining, but deeply unsettling. Every ""living"" creature, from small pets to humans, makes me question if the developers had a fascination with taxidermy."
137,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Alright. Let me explain a few things. As someone very interested in politics, I was intrigued by this game when I first heard about it. I thought, ""Oh wow! A simulator about the road to becoming president! That sounds fun!"" Well, it wasn’t. The game forces you to pick a side: Republican or Democrat—no independent or third-party option. A little disappointed but still optimistic, I continued to see what I could do. I’ll give the game credit: the character customization, though limited, is fun to experiment with. It’s the only time you can choose whether to wear your head in a campaign. Literally."

Recoil and ballistics are realistic—single hits to the chest, neck, or head from rifle-caliber weapons are almost always fatal unless it’s a graze. Bullets drop over distance, and controlled bursts are essential for accuracy. There’s no infinite ammo; reloading mid-magazine leaves you with half-empty pouches. Sprinting drains stamina, worsening aim until you recover. Prone or resting your weapon stabilizes shots; standing reduces accuracy."

However, the predominantly linear interaction between motion and light or electricity restricts access to richer quantum states, such as cat states or energy squeezed states.

202,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,paper_abstract,"We developed single-shot shaped pulses for ultra-high-fidelity (UH-fidelity) population transfer in a 3-level quantum system with lambda configuration. To ensure high fidelity, we employ the Lewis-Riesenfeld (L-R) method to derive a family of solutions enabling exact transfer, where the solutions follow a single dynamical mode of the L-R invariant. Within this family, we identify a tracking solution with a single parameter to simultaneously control transfer fidelity, excited-state population, and robustness. We quantify robustness as the minimum percentile deviation in pulse areas at which infidelity exceeds $10^{-4}$. Our shaped pulses exhibit superior robustness compared to Gaussian and adiabatically optimized pulses for moderate pulse areas."

Due to nonconvexity, multiple local minima exist that are not globally optimal, even in well-separated mixtures. We demonstrate that all local minima share a common structural form, partially identifying true component centers—each involves either fitting multiple Gaussians to one true component or one Gaussian to multiple true components. Our results hold under a separation condition for true components and remain valid when the component count is misspecified. For three-component Gaussian mixtures, we derive sharper results based on separation scaling."

This orbifold arises as a quotient by a suitable subgroup $G$ of the phase symmetries of the hypersurface $X_m$ in weighted projective space, defined by a quasi-homogeneous polynomial $W_m$. The first, Berglund-Hübsch-Krawitz (BHK) construction, employs another weighted projective space and the quotient of a new hypersurface $X_{m^t}$ by a dual group $G^t$. The second, Batyrev construction, defines the mirror as a hypersurface in the toric variety associated with the reflexive polytope dual to the original Calabi-Yau orbifold's polytope. We provide simple evidence for the equivalence of these constructions."

207,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,paper_abstract,"Entanglement is a key resource for quantum information processing. A widely used tool for detecting entanglement is the entanglement witness, where measuring the witness operator yields positive results for all separable states and may produce negative results for certain entangled states. In practice, due to the exponential growth of Hilbert-space dimension with system size, constructing an efficient entanglement witness for general multipartite entangled states is highly challenging. For $n$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-like states, the most robust witness requires $n+1$ local measurement settings and tolerates up to $1/2$ white noise. In contrast, the most efficient witness for GHZ-like states needs only two local measurement settings and tolerates up to $1/3$ white noise."
208,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,paper_abstract,"Within general relativity, the unique stationary solution for an isolated black hole is the Kerr spacetime, characterized by a distinctive multipolar structure determined solely by its mass and spin. We present a general method to extract multipole moments from arbitrary stationary spacetimes and apply it to a broad class of horizonless microstate geometries. These geometries can violate the axial and equatorial symmetry of the Kerr metric, exhibiting a far richer multipolar structure that offers a phenomenological window into constraining fuzzball models. Our numerical analysis suggests that all multipole moments are generally larger (in absolute value) than those of a Kerr black hole with identical mass and spin. Current measurements of black-hole candidates' quadrupole moments impose only weak constraints on fuzzballs, whereas future gravitational-wave observations of extreme mass-ratio inspirals by the LISA mission will enhance these bounds significantly."

Typically, long-term edges are human-defined, which can be costly and suboptimal for downstream applications. To address this, we propose a model combining temporal point processes and variational autoencoders that learns temporal attention between nodes by observing their interactions. Since temporal attention governs feature propagation, learning it from interaction dynamics offers greater flexibility while avoiding pitfalls of human-specified edges."

The nonparametric version, called modal clustering, associates groups with the domains of attraction of density modes. Practically, this requires a nonparametric density estimate, and selecting the right amount of smoothing—which affects both the density shape and modal structure—is key to determining the final partition. In this work, we examine density estimation for modal clustering from an asymptotic perspective."

However, helicity selection rules for diboson scattering amplitudes suppress the naïve interference contributions from dimension-six operators, causing the leading diboson rate correction to vanish. In this scenario, precise measurements of azimuthal decay angles restore the interference, recovering sensitivity to these ""non-interfering"" operators. We analyze these signatures in detail, demonstrating that EFT uncertainties from higher-dimensional operators are exceptionally suppressed by constructing an asymmetry variable exclusively generated by non-interfering operators. This relegates interfering higher-dimensional operator effects to the same level as statistical uncertainties in this observable."

This note demonstrates that, for a generic Einstein quantum theory of gravity in AdS, exact stability of extremal black branes conflicts with rigorously proven quantum information theorems about entanglement entropy. Resolving this contradiction yields a nonperturbative version of the WGC, which simplifies to the standard form at weak coupling. The argument is broadly applicable, independent of supersymmetry or specific UV completions, relying only on Einsteinian gravity, effective field theory, and holography."

Ultracold 2D Fermi gases serve as pristine, tunable models for studying strong correlations and reduced dimensionality, yet direct evidence of superfluidity has been elusive. Here, we reveal superfluidity in an ultracold 2D Fermi gas by moving a periodic potential through the system and observing dissipationless flow below a critical velocity v$_{\rm c}$.

254,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"I know this may sound unusual, but I believe robots can inspire us to be better humans. I grew up in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, home of Bethlehem Steel. My father, an engineer, taught me how things worked. We built projects together—model rockets, slot cars. Here’s the go-kart we made, with me behind the wheel, my sister, and my best friend. When I was about 10, he announced at dinner that our next project would be... a robot."
255,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"Sustainability defines the what, where, and how of what is caught. The who and why matter most to me. I want to know the people behind my meals, how I affect them, and how they affect me. I want to understand why they fish and how they depend on the water's bounty for their livelihood. Grasping this shifts our view of seafood from a commodity to a chance to heal our ecosystem. It lets us appreciate the seafood we’re lucky to enjoy. So what do we call this? I call it restorative seafood. While sustainability is about enduring, restorative means replenishing and progressing."
256,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"The starving orphan begging for a second helping of gruel. The spinster fading away in her tattered wedding dress. The miser haunted by the ghost of Christmas past. Over a century after his death, these remain iconic figures from Charles Dickens's work. His writing is so distinctive that it inspired its own adjective. But what makes Dickens's style so remarkable? His fiction thrives on suspense, crafted through atmospheric settings, unexpected turns, and lingering mysteries. These elements captivated his audience, leaving them eager for more. Originally, his stories were serialized—released in affordable literary journals chapter by chapter before being compiled into books."

These are the brave hearts for whom failure is never an option. What seems like an unconquerable sea to us is, for our next speaker, an irresistible stage she was born to command. Let’s dive into the story of fearless long-distance swimmer Bhakti Sharma. (Applause)  

Bhakti Sharma: Picture this—a scorching Rajasthan afternoon, a two-and-a-half-year-old riding a moped behind her mother, unaware of their destination. Twenty minutes later, that child finds herself submerged in water."
258,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"I'm going to discuss a groundbreaking technology we're developing at Oxford, which we believe will revolutionize computer games and Hollywood movies. This innovation involves simulating humans—complete with virtual bodies and nervous systems to control them. Before delving deeper, let's examine how human characters currently appear in games. Here's a clip from *Grand Theft Auto 3*, which we briefly saw yesterday. It's an exceptional game and one of the most successful ever made."
259,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"Like many people around the world, earlier this summer my friends and I were captivated by the Women's World Cup in France. We watched incredible athletes deliver amazing goals in clean, engaging matches. Meanwhile, off the field, these women advocated for equal pay—or, in some cases, any pay at all for their sport. Our mild obsession led us to watch the games live, choosing a Spanish-speaking network in the U.S. as our go-to. A few games in, a friend remarked, ""Why does it feel like everything I'm seeing is ads for makeup, cleaning products, and diets?"

""I want to discuss the future of money. Let’s begin with a story about the Yap, a culture from Micronesia in the early 1900s. Their form of currency was fascinating—they used large limestone discs called *rai stones*. Unlike modern coins, the Yap rarely moved these stones due to their enormous size, with the largest weighing four tons and spanning 12 feet. Instead, they tracked ownership. There’s even a tale of sailors losing a stone at sea during transport."
261,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"You’ve been accused of a crime you did not commit. Proving your innocence is impossible. If you maintain it, you’ll likely be convicted and executed. But if you confess, apologize, and implicate others, you’ll go free. Do you falsely confess—or risk a public hanging? This was the dilemma for those accused of witchcraft in Salem, Massachusetts, between February 1692 and May 1693. They fell victim to supernatural paranoia, misguided religious fervor—and a justice system that prioritized repentance over truth. Salem was founded in 1626 by Puritans, English Protestants. Life there was strict and isolated. Conflicts with Native American neighbors and French settlers were frequent."
262,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"There are currently hundreds of thousands of people on transplant lists awaiting critical organs like kidneys, hearts, and livers to save their lives. Unfortunately, donor organs remain scarce to meet this demand. What if, instead of waiting, we could create new, customized organs from scratch? That’s the vision behind bioprinting, an emerging branch of regenerative medicine. While we can’t yet print complex organs, simpler tissues like blood vessels and nutrient-exchange tubes are already achievable. Bioprinting is a biological counterpart to 3D printing, layering materials to construct three-dimensional objects slice by slice."
263,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"Good afternoon, I’m honored to be here at TEDxKrakow. Today, I’ll discuss a phenomenon that is reshaping our world: people power. I’ll begin with an anecdote—or for Monty Python fans, a sketch-like tale. It’s December 15, 2010. Someone offers you a bet: gaze into a crystal ball and see the future—an accurate one—but you must share it with the world. Curiosity wins; you take the bet. An hour later, you’re on national TV, recounting what you saw."
264,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"We begin in 1964. Bob Dylan, 23, is at the peak of his career. Hailed as the voice of a generation, he produces timeless songs at an astonishing pace. Yet a small group claims he steals others' work.  

In 2004, Brian Burton, aka Danger Mouse, blends The Beatles' *White Album* with Jay-Z's *The Black Album*, creating *The Grey Album*. It quickly goes viral, but The Beatles' label issues cease-and-desist letters for ""unfair competition."" Today, *The Grey Album* stands as a remix."
265,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"Well, that’s a rather obvious statement. I began with that sentence nearly 12 years ago, initially focusing on developing countries, but you’re here from every corner of the world. If you picture a map of your country, you’ll realize that for every nation, you could mark areas where good teachers won’t go. Worse yet, these are often the same places where trouble arises. It’s an ironic problem—good teachers avoid the very areas that need them most. In 1999, I launched an experiment in New Delhi to address this issue—a very simple one."
266,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"Currently, most refugees reside in urban areas rather than camps, representing over 60% of refugees worldwide. With this shift, a new approach is essential. Instead of investing in barriers, funds should support programs empowering refugees to become self-sufficient. (Applause) We often leave behind possessions, but never our skills and knowledge. Given the opportunity, refugees can thrive and contribute to their host nations. I was born in Bukavu, South Kivu, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, as the fifth of twelve children."
267,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"I have two questions for you. First: whose shoulders do you stand on? And second: what do you stand for? These are the questions I open my poetry workshops with because poetry can sometimes feel like a relic—an art form for old white men who seemed destined to be elderly, like Benjamin Button. I ask my students these questions, then share my own answers in three lines: I am the daughter of Black writers, descended from freedom fighters who broke their chains and changed the world. They call me. These words become my mantra before every poetry performance—I was even reciting them earlier, making faces in the corner."
268,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"(Breathes in) (Breathes out) So, I didn’t always make my living from music. For five years after graduating from a respected liberal arts university, this was my day job. (Laughter) I was a self-employed living statue called the Eight-Foot Bride, and I love telling people about it because everyone wonders, 'Who are these people in real life?' (Laughter) Hello.  

One day, I painted myself white, stood on a box, placed a hat or can at my feet, and when someone dropped money, I gave them a flower—and intense eye contact. If they didn’t take it, I added a gesture of sadness and longing as they walked away."
269,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"On October 4, 1957, the world watched in awe as the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the first artificial satellite, into space. This small metal sphere, less than two feet wide, ignited an 18-year space race between the U.S. and U.S.S.R., reshaping history. However, Sputnik wasn’t humanity’s initial venture beyond Earth. That distinction belongs to Germany’s V-2 rocket, deployed in WWII’s final years. Though ineffective, postwar, both superpowers seized the technology—and its creators—for their own ambitions."
270,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"I am a cultural omnivore, whose daily commute is fueled by my iPod—filled with Wagner and Mozart, pop diva Christina Aguilera, country singer Josh Turner, gospel artist Kirk Franklin, concertos, symphonies, and more. I'm a voracious reader, delving into works from Ian McEwan to Stephanie Meyer, including the *Twilight* series. I thrive in my home theater, devouring DVDs, on-demand videos, and television—from *Law & Order: SVU* and Tina Fey’s *30 Rock* to *Judge Judy*: 'The people are real, the cases are real, the rulings are final.'"
271,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"[Citizens of the world,][we face a global crisis of unprecedented scale.][Please stand by for a message from...][the Secretary-General of the United Nations, António Guterres.] The climate emergency is the defining crisis of our time. We are racing against time—and falling behind. Impatience grows, especially among youth, over global inaction. Greater ambition is needed from all: governments, cities, businesses, investors, and individuals worldwide. I’m encouraged by the launch of TED Countdown. Your influence and ideas can drive momentum toward a carbon-neutral world by 2050. This is our only path to avoiding the worst impacts of global heating. The tools, science, and resources exist. Now, we must act with political will and urgency."
272,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"Menstruation—a simple word describing a natural biological process—is burdened by centuries of stigma, reduced to a topic many whisper about. But why? Right now, over 800 million women worldwide are menstruating. None of us would exist without it, yet it remains an ""embarrassing"" subject. From my experience and that of countless women, I can say it’s exhausting. Exhausting to hide a pad in a brown paper bag, stuff it into your pocket mid-class, and rush discreetly to the washroom. Exhausting to sit through lessons or meetings, pretending everything’s fine while enduring intense cramps."
274,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"Before the world of humans began, there existed a divine realm of fields, plains, and gardens. Four brothers wandered this celestial domain, with no family but each other—not even knowing their parents. One brother, Deminan, stood apart, his skin covered in painful scabs. He often wondered why he alone bore this affliction. One day, while the supreme spirit Yaya tended his gardens, Deminan and his brothers sneaked into Yaya’s house. After feasting and exploring, they discovered a giant gourd hanging in the corner. But as they peered inside, they dropped it."
275,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"Seven years ago, I graduated from Berkeley with dual degrees in molecular and cell biology and linguistics. At a campus career fair, I secured an interview with Theranos, a startup. Back then, there wasn’t much information about the company, but what little existed was impressive. Essentially, they were developing a medical device capable of running a full blood panel from just a finger-stick sample. This meant no more painful needle draws for blood tests. Beyond reducing discomfort, it also held promise for advancing predictive diagnostics."
276,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"My journey to become a polar specialist, photographing and studying the polar regions, began at age four when my family moved from southern Canada to northern Baffin Island, near Greenland. There, we lived among the Inuit in a small community of 200, where we were one of three non-Inuit families. Without television, computers, radio, or even a telephone, I spent all my time outdoors with the Inuit. The snow and ice were my playground, and the Inuit were my mentors. That’s where my deep fascination with the polar world took root."
279,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"Chris Anderson: Hello, TED community, welcome back for another live conversation. Today’s discussion is monumental—as significant as they come. When we launched the ""Build Back Better"" series, our goal was to tackle pandemic-related challenges and envision recovery. Yet, the tragic death of George Floyd and the ensuing protests have added a pressing urgency we must confront. Can we truly rebuild better from this? Before answering, we must first grasp the gravity of this moment.  

Whitney Pennington Rodgers: That’s right, Chris."
280,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"In 1903, the president of the United States embarked on a three-day camping trip in California’s Yosemite Valley. President Theodore Roosevelt slept among towering sequoias, weathered a snowstorm, and shared campfire conversations with his host, conservationist John Muir. Though Roosevelt adored the outdoors, Muir’s invitation served a greater purpose: Yosemite was under threat. Despite gaining protected status in 1864, the valley faced overdevelopment by 1903. It stood at the center of a decades-long struggle to balance preservation and public access—goals far harder to achieve than to declare. The conflict over Yosemite traces back to the 1849 Gold Rush, when miners flooded the Sierra Nevada foothills."

""I’m sorry I can’t show you my face because if I do, the bad guys will come for me. My journey began 14 years ago when I was a young reporter fresh out of college. I got a scoop—a simple story about police officers taking bribes from street hawkers. Since everyone knew it was happening but nothing was being done, I decided to act as a seller to document hard evidence. The impact was tremendous. This is what many call immersion or undercover journalism."
283,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"One simple vitamin can reduce your risk of heart disease. Eating chocolate lowers stress in students. A new drug extends lives of patients with a rare disease. Health headlines like these appear daily, often contradicting one another. There’s often a gap between flashy headlines and the nuanced findings of the research they cite. So how can you avoid being misled? The best approach is to examine the original study. We’ve created hypothetical research scenarios for each headline. Watch for the first example’s explanation, then pause to answer the question. These are simplified scenarios."

Twenty years later, I’m still working on it, but now I tackle this issue globally. So, what do birth certificates have to do with international development?"
285,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"Imagine if you could connect your mind to a machine offering endless pleasure for life. If given the choice, would you embrace such an existence? That’s the question philosopher Robert Nozick explored in his thought experiment, the Experience Machine. It challenges us to envision a world where scientists create a device simulating reality—delivering only joy and no suffering. The catch? You must abandon reality permanently, though the difference would be imperceptible. Your experiences would mirror real life, but its natural highs and lows would vanish, replaced by ceaseless euphoria. Sounds perfect, doesn’t it?"
286,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"I’d like to share the most embarrassing moment from my years as a palliative care physician. It happened a few years ago when I was consulted to see a woman in her 70s—a retired English professor with pancreatic cancer. She was experiencing pain, nausea, and vomiting. During our discussion about her symptoms, she asked if medical marijuana might help. I reflected on my medical school education regarding medical marijuana—which took no time at all, since I’d learned nothing about it."
287,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"For the past 24 years, I have been a firefighter in Huntington, West Virginia. My team and I are tasked with saving lives and property from disasters like car wrecks, house fires, and medical emergencies. As a woman leading a department in a male-dominated profession, I faced unique challenges. A decade ago, I chose to expand my medical expertise by earning a nursing degree. I realized the next major threat to my city—and others nationwide—wasn’t the sudden disaster where firefighters rush in, resolve the crisis, and leave. Instead, it required deeper, sustained intervention to truly make a difference."
288,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"Where does all the carbon we release go? Carbon operates in a natural cycle, present in all living things: in soil, oceans, the atmosphere, and deep underground rocks. When plants and organisms die, much of their stored carbon returns to the atmosphere until new plants absorb it. Over millions of years, some carbon from ancient trees and marine life forms rocks or fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas. Volcanic eruptions release carbon trapped in rock, while human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, unleash prehistoric carbon. Today, humans emit roughly 60 times more carbon annually than all volcanoes combined."
289,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"Even nature's most repulsive creatures hold vital secrets, but who would welcome a swarm of cockroaches? Yet one key distinction between natural and human technologies lies in robustness. Robust systems remain stable in complex, unfamiliar environments. Astonishingly, cockroaches can self-stabilize while running over rough terrain. When equipped with a jet pack or subjected to disturbances like earthquakes, their finely tuned legs enable self-stabilization without brainpower. They traverse complex terrain like grass effortlessly, maintaining stability. We observed a novel behavior: their body shape allows them to roll sideways automatically to navigate artificial grass patches. Robust systems can perform multiple tasks with the same structure—a fascinating discovery."
290,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"These are grim economic times, fellow TEDsters—grim indeed. To lift your spirits, let me share one of the great, albeit lesser-known, commercial success stories of the past two decades. In its own peculiar way, it rivals the achievements of Microsoft or Google. This industry has weathered the current recession with remarkable ease: organized crime.  

Now, organized crime is nothing new, you might say—and you’d be right. But over the last 20 years, it has expanded unprecedentedly, now accounting for roughly 15% of global GDP. I call it the ""global shadow economy,"" or McMafia for short. So, what fueled this explosive growth in cross-border crime?"
291,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"If you ask people which aspect of psychology they find challenging and mention thinking and emotions, most will say, ""Emotions are terribly hard—they're incredibly complex. I have no idea how they work. But thinking is straightforward: just logical reasoning or something. That’s not the difficult part.""  

Here’s a list of problems that arise. One interesting issue is health. Recently, I read that handshaking may be the leading cause of disease in the West."
292,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"What is a parent? It’s not an easy question. Today, we have adoption, stepfamilies, and surrogate mothers. Many parents face difficult questions and decisions. Should we tell our child about the sperm donation? If so, when? What words should we use? Sperm donors are often called 'biological fathers,' but is 'father' the right term? As a philosopher and social scientist, I’ve studied these questions about parenthood. Today, I’ll share what I learned from speaking with parents and children. I’ll show you that they understand what truly matters in a family, even if theirs looks different."

(Cheers) I see all of that and a man who spent a quarter of his life in prison—six years, to be exact, starting as a teenager on Rikers Island for an act that nearly cost a man his life. But what brought me from there to here wasn’t the punishment I endured as a teenager in adult prison or the harshness of our legal system. Instead, it was the transformative power of a classroom, which introduced me to possibilities I never imagined—for myself or our justice system. Weeks before my parole release, a counselor urged me to enroll in a new college course offered in prison."
