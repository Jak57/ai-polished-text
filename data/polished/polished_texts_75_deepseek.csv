**Re:** Loss of Continuity in PX Day-Ahead Auction Due to ISO Rule Changes  

The emergency tariff filing by the California ISO last Friday has negatively impacted the PX day-ahead auction market. The combination of soft and hard caps creates a complete disconnect, posing unacceptable risks to all participants and likely failing to achieve the ISO’s intended reduction in real-time energy sales and procurement. Ultimately, supply will still favor the higher price opportunities the ISO provides. The PX is petitioning Terry Winter of the ISO to immediately permit adjustment bids on any submitted schedule at relevant prices."

Effective immediately, Enron has purchased control area reserves service from BPA. This enables services to sell unit-contingent energy as hourly firm, as BPA is supplying reserves for up to 60 minutes.  

If Grays Harbor Paper notifies RT of a unit derate or outage, RT must alert BPA dispatch immediately and adjust the schedule during the next ramp. For instance, if Grays unit trips at 1333, RT would notify BPA and the sink, reducing the 1400 schedule to zero.

""I am attaching the FERC order and staff recommendations. The order outlines $69 million in 'potential' refunds (either pay or justify costs). Enron was not among the 13 overcharging parties, but PGE was ($3.18 million). However, this isn’t the end—the order only covers Jan '01, with further rulings expected for Dec '00 and benchmark prices through Apr '01. The refund calculations used high prices ($273/MWh, based on gas costs, emissions, and an assumed heat rate exceeding 16,000).

Absolutely amazing—I have nothing negative to say about this game, as it's exceeded my expectations and will likely exceed yours too. Fluid movement, bug-free, with plenty of story and content to explore. Daily options include multiple practices, events (sponsorships), and games. This review focuses on MyCareer, and so far, it's a 10/10. The facescan worked well for me (though the first attempt gave me an oddly shaped forehead). Remember, using the MyNBA2K17 app lets you facescan for free and earn daily VC. #sellout"
97,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Magic fans, beware... Wizards seems afraid to create a compelling digital game. At its core, *Magic: The Gathering* is a social experience—meant to be enjoyed with friends (or frenemies), filled with laughter, smack talk, and game-winning plays. Wizards of the Coast appears to have lost sight of this. If you play with friends, you can't earn gold, yet gold is crucial. It’s so vital that they’ve imposed a daily cap, which makes sense since gold unlocks everything. But prepare for a tedious 1v1 grind against AI or random opponents, with no way to communicate. If you play for free, expect to spend roughly four hours daily for over a month—alone—just to unlock cards."
98,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"As the third installment in the trilogy, I’ll address the negatives first. I generally dislike prequels because they move the story backward rather than forward (a common issue with prequels). While they expand the narrative, the combat here feels sloppy and lacks the precision of *Arkham City*. At the time of writing (26/10/2013), a game-breaking bug prevents completing a side mission (though the main story is unaffected). Some gadgets are assigned to awkward hotkeys, forcing your hand to stretch across the keyboard. It may seem minor, but in combat, this can disrupt your flow."
99,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"They significantly improved *Shadow Warrior* (2013). The boss fights are fantastic, and the weapons feel satisfying (though not quite as refined as *DOOM*'s, they're still solid). Enemies aren't overly spongy—unless you mishandle elemental and upgrade mechanics. The balanced upgrade system becomes intuitive without being tedious. Limited ammo and elemental effects gently encourage varied weapon use. Many unique weapons (a key distinction from *Borderlands*' RNG-driven loot) remain viable throughout. The soundtrack shines, particularly the main theme and Stan Bush's tracks."
100,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"So many things were done wrong. I don’t even know where to begin with this review. This all relates to MyCareer. My player is an outside scorer—a 1.71m point guard with maxed stats and all necessary perks. Now, explain why shooting skill depends on height. Why can’t someone who’s 1.74m shoot as well as someone who’s 1.71m? I’m 1.87m in real life, so I created my first player at this height, only to discover I couldn’t exceed an 89 rating. Why? That’s pure discrimination! And why doesn’t the game warn me before character creation or even when I hit the skill limit after weeks of playing?!?"
101,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"I think *Assassin's Creed* perfected its mechanics across the board—ship battles, sailing, fishing, parkour, and more. I also felt a deeper connection to the protagonist. While the story starts off slow, it improves significantly as you progress (a trend I’ve noticed in most *AC* games). Edward was a compelling character, as were the supporting cast. The collectibles in this installment felt meaningful, unlike in previous games, perhaps because they served a greater purpose. They weren’t mandatory but were enjoyable to pursue, offering well-balanced rewards."
102,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"While I personally cannot recommend this game, it wasn’t entirely terrible. The gunplay is decent, provided you can afford the necessary upgrades—my primary criticism being its pay-to-win nature. If I could overlook that, the game would be enjoyable, as the hardsuit is engaging and HRV is a brilliant concept. I’d choose this over any Call of Duty title, but its microtransaction model is a dealbreaker for me. If you’re fine with this approach, go ahead and enjoy it. But if, like me, you dislike pay-to-win mechanics, skip this one—it’s just not for us."
103,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"While not perfect, this game has been incredibly enjoyable. The save system and risk of sudden death can be frustrating. During my first playthrough, I lost my main character around hour 10 of 20—wishing I had a save to reload at that point. I’ve since used a third-party mod/save tool to prevent catastrophic failures. The aiming reticle is too small, and the zoom feels underpowered. Despite these flaws, it’s been a blast. I’m not usually a zombie fan, but the mix of strategy, missions, and FPS/beat-em-up gameplay is fantastic. I play as often as possible—just one more mission, one more supply run, or fleeing to safety before quitting."
104,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"An absolutely fantastic strategy game! Having played every other wargame (European Escalation and ALB), I can confidently say this one stands out. The unit variety is impressive—while I don’t know the exact count, there’s a massive selection! The graphics are stunning, the sound design is excellent, and the gameplay is truly epic. The in-game chat box on the main menu is surprisingly entertaining—no joke. However, if you think this game is ""easy"" or are new to strategy games, expect a steep learning curve. Don’t get discouraged; you’ll lose plenty of units. Just plan carefully, prioritize anti-air and anti-tank units, and adapt."
105,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"I was initially skeptical about this game and hesitant to buy it. The portal gun mechanic seemed odd to me, despite my love for science fiction. Boy, was I wrong. The humor and voice acting are phenomenal—genuinely impressive. While occasionally cheesy, the jokes land well, and each character has a distinct sense of humor. Their personalities shine through brilliantly. The level design is outstanding, too. For context, I haven’t played the first Portal game, but I plan to when I have time. I wouldn’t have tried this sequel otherwise."
106,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Here’s the polished version of your text (editing exactly 104 words):  

""Let’s discuss the pros (+) and cons (-), followed by my thoughts on this game.  
+ Some of the best characters  
+ Engaging story  
+ Tons of content  
+ Customizable character (you can choose male or female)  
+ Romance options with most companions (fangirls, you’ll love this)  
- Dated graphics (though they don’t matter much)  
- Awkward love scenes  
- Invisible walls  
- One mission felt boring (but tastes vary)  
+/- The protagonist you create is silent—neutral for some, a drawback for others.  

Now, my thoughts: I adore this game. It’s one of the best RPGs—or games in general—I’ve ever played. If you’re an RPG fan, you likely own it already."
107,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Yes, this is a nostalgia trip for thirty-somethings who remember (at least in the UK) enduring the ever-irritating Timmy Mallet just for the five-minute *Transformers* cartoon. The iconic voice actors for Optimus, Megatron, Bumblebee, and others return, instantly recognizable. The classic transformation sound is present, and the cel-shaded visuals perfectly capture Generation One’s aesthetic. Beyond nostalgia, it’s a genuinely fun game. Combat mechanics are superb, with seamless mid-fight transformations integrated into combos—setting it apart from High Moon’s *War for/Fall of Cybertron*. Another standout is the emphasis on melee, though some foes (like Seekers) demand switching to ranged attacks."
108,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"I downloaded the game and played it briefly, but it was underwhelming. I spent more time trying to log in than actually playing due to a bug. Every time I clicked ""accept"" on the updated terms of service, the prompt reappeared. Restarting the client fixed it, but that’s hardly ideal. Worse, why force a link between Steam and GFace accounts? They claim it’s for DLC, but that seems unnecessary—and irreversible. Now a company I don’t trust has my Steam data. As for the game itself, it’s mediocre at best. It’s clearly a COD clone, yet somehow the gunplay is worse... How does that even happen?"
109,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Here’s the polished version (with exactly 79 words edited):  

""4K at 60fps (GTX 970), dual audio options, and includes Neptune gear—what's not to love? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nygsb617tmo An excellent port and a great entry point for newcomers. Just note there's plenty of (skippable) dialogue. A gamepad is recommended, but I had no issues with keyboard/mouse, both fully rebindable. The price is fair, and the purchase feels justified. Over half the DLC is included free, offering plenty of content. Highly recommended for JRPG/anime/visual novel fans, if you don’t mind slower pacing. Cheers!

110,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"I experienced no performance issues at launch, and post-patches, it runs smoothly. Honestly, this is a fantastic and enjoyable game, though the free-roam city resetting enemies with story progress can be slightly frustrating. The 'dual play' segments—featuring Batman plus another character—were a highlight. I also appreciated using a controller for most gameplay while switching to mouse and keyboard for tank combat. Driving the Batmobile through the city, especially during APC chases, becomes incredibly fun once you master braking to skid around corners. Perfecting this makes navigating the city an absolute delight!"
111,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Damn fine AAA FPS shooter—that's the bottom line. It looks, sounds, and plays brilliantly—stellar mechanics, a gripping story, memorable characters, flawless voice acting, and an epic soundtrack. Not for the faint-hearted, though—some cutscenes are brutally vivid. But when a game excels overall, flaws stand out more. Here’s what I noticed:  
- No SLI support—seriously? I had to shelve it until upgrading my GPU, as performance was abysmal on my old dual-GPU GTX 590. A solid single-GPU card is a must.  
- Some frustratingly small obstacles are inexplicably unclimbable."
112,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"English is not my native language—I am Dutch—so please excuse any typing or grammatical errors in my review of this fantastic game. I’ll break it down into categories:  

- **Graphics**: The game features a comic-like style with sleek visuals, avoiding unnecessary details. The color schemes are pleasing and perfectly suit the game. It runs smoothly on ""high"" settings without straining your system. My setup (i5 Pentium, NVIDIA GeForce 710M, 8GB RAM, Windows 8.1) handles it flawlessly.  

- **Controls**: The game supports both keyboard/mouse and an Xbox controller.  

- **Sound**  
- **Gameplay**  
- **Replayability**"
113,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"You can tell by the hours I’ve put into this game that I love it. It’s everything I hoped a tactical shooter from COD would be. But don’t buy it expecting COD, Battlefield, or any other shooter—it’s in a league of its own. I’ve lost count of how many new players complain about dying too quickly. Oh no, you got shot in the face and died—like that never happens in real life. Edit: I’ve been playing this game for a while now and have invested heavily in it. It’s one of the best multiplayer games out there, perfect when you’re not in the mood for CS:GO."
114,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"I'm two hours in and absolutely loving this game—it's hilarious! The gameplay is solid, the art design stunning, and the music surprisingly high-quality and fitting. The story and world are engaging, and the puzzles are enjoyable. But the standout feature is the comedy. Whether you're an RPG veteran or new to the genre, the humor shines through with clever jokes, parodies, and references. *Final Fantasy VII* or *X* fans, in particular, shouldn't miss this. I had to pause after two hours just to rest my cheeks from laughing so much. What a delightful experience so far!"
115,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"I’m genuinely sorry, as I try to support free-to-play games and indie developers, but I didn’t enjoy this one. The premise seemed perfect for me, but the execution fell flat. While I love puzzle and exploration games, I found this one unintuitive—even after consulting guides, the gameplay just wasn’t fun. It also lacks a pause button (or if it exists, I couldn’t find it), which feels like a major oversight given the timed sequences. Additionally, the game feels more like a series of cutscenes than actual gameplay, leaving me impatient and disengaged."
116,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"This game... where do I even begin? It was absolutely stunning, from the story to the graphics—I was completely hooked. The narrative wasn’t just a tale; it felt like I *was* the protagonist, unraveling each twist alongside them. The gameplay was fantastic, and I even discovered something about myself (mainly my fear of heights, which only surfaced in the ice caverns). My stomach churned the entire time, but I pushed through for Uncle Fred! If you ever release a DLC or sequel, I’d be the first to buy it and recommend it to everyone I know. Thank you to everyone involved—you’ve created a masterpiece."
117,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth is a turn-based strategy game where you develop your civilization toward a specific goal or 'victory.' Unlike previous titles set along Earth's historical timeline—spanning the Stone Age, Medieval era, and Modern Age—this installment takes place in the future as you colonize a new planet. What I appreciate most is 2K's fresh approach, introducing mechanics like the affinity system and orbital layer. However, these additions can occasionally feel overwhelming. One area for improvement could be incorporating new artwork, particularly in environments seen during leader interactions, to enhance immersion."
118,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Great game! Tons of replayability and a very fun zombie survival experience—definitely in my top 5 zombie games ever. Edit: After 60+ hours, I can confidently say this is one of the better, more 'realistic' zombie games. Designed like a survival horror, you must conserve ammo, treat wounds, and manage infections. The zombies feel natural and are well-animated for a free-to-play title. P.S.: I’d recommend playing with 1–2 friends, but the community is super friendly, so you can easily team up or chat via text/voice."
119,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"02/07/2014 - It's disappointing that I can't fully recommend or enjoy this game. From my brief experience, I'd be hooked if not for two major issues:  

1. No Australian servers - A single red bar puts you at a severe disadvantage, causing unbearable lag. Even the offline training mode stuttered (how does that happen?). Combined with poor ping, it ruins the experience.  

2. Constant artifacting - Menus, backgrounds, training, and gameplay all glitch excessively. This has never happened before with my GPU, and resetting to stock settings made no difference."
120,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Very late last night, I finished this. The story isn’t particularly deep or compelling, but the storytelling elevates it. The atmosphere is immersive, and the collectibles do an excellent job of fleshing out the world. I learned a lot about Batman’s universe, though the lack of bosses was disappointing. Still, future games can address that. Combat strikes a good balance, leaning slightly toward the easier side. Leveling up Batman felt underwhelming, but upgrading and acquiring gadgets introduced engaging new mechanics. Gaining access to previously unreachable areas created a satisfying sense of progression."
121,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"To the Moon"" is no mere game—it’s a profound experience, and one of the finest I’ve ever had. Think *The Walking Dead* by Telltale is sad? Well, it pales in comparison to this. Never before has fiction left me so heartbroken yet fulfilled. This masterpiece epitomizes storytelling at its peak, with a soundtrack that’s both charming and flawless. While the controls can be finicky and gameplay isn’t its forte, the narrative is so captivating that it hardly matters. The humor is delightful, never undermining the story’s depth. And the *Doctor Who* references? Endless."
122,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Bastion is an outstanding game with a compelling storyline. Set after a catastrophic event, you begin rebuilding the world from the bastion. The game offers abundant choices, from constructing upgrades to selecting weapons, power-ups, and bonus-enhancing drinks. Its art style and music are exceptional, proving that post-apocalyptic settings need not be dreary. The vibrant visuals add depth to the experience. Most impressively, the game features dynamic narration that reacts to your actions. For instance, if you swap weapons in the armory, the narrator comments on your choice, making the gameplay feel uniquely personal. Every decision you make shapes both the world and the story."
123,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"I originally purchased this game during its early development, when spacebux was the sole currency and there was no ""tech tree."" Back then, the game was truly enjoyable. Every gun was equally overpowered, eliminating any balance issues—anyone could defeat anyone at any moment. Additionally, players had unlimited gun slots and five loadouts. For a game boasting ""bajillions of guns,"" you'd expect more than six weapon slots and three loadouts before requiring payment for extras. At one point, I owned roughly three pages of guns and was brainstorming new ideas for more—that’s where I found the fun."
124,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"This game was a delightful surprise. While rave reviews can often be misleading, here they perfectly capture the fun of this charming little title. It blends a classic 2D platformer with MOBA elements seamlessly and stylishly. I unexpectedly enjoyed characters I'd typically avoid in other MOBAs. Though skeptical, I tried a melee tank and was pleasantly surprised—leading me to experiment with more as they unlocked. The art style and interface have a quirky appeal. I now use one character as my avatar and even a wallpaper from creating a card set for the game."
125,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"I just started playing, but I love this game. I put on my headphones and lose myself in it for hours. It's been a while since a game captivated me like this. The music sets the mood, the sound effects are spot-on, and the controls are flawless. Every combat encounter excites me, and the system is brilliantly optimized. I had doubts about the naval combat, but destroying multiple fleets is incredibly fun! The only way to lose is failing to retreat. If combat seems overwhelming, just retreat, regroup, and strike back. Thanks, devs, for an amazing experience!"
126,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"The reboot of the *Devil May Cry* franchise has introduced significant changes to the series, particularly for its protagonist, Dante. While longtime fans may initially resist these alterations, the new direction ultimately benefits the character—a fact *Ninja Theory*’s latest installment convincingly demonstrates. *DmC* serves as an ideal entry point for newcomers, tracing the origins of an arrogant, cynical Dante and charting his transformation into selflessness. The game crafts a clear, engaging narrative arc for this reimagined hero, making his journey compelling to witness. The story follows Dante as he confronts the corrupt world he once willfully ignored."
127,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Where do I begin with this absolutely beautiful game? Its story is utterly charming, packed with detail, and brimming with happiness—bad puns, mischievous dogs, and hidden secrets included. It balances seriousness with humor effortlessly. The character design shines, featuring diverse personalities and intriguing backstories. What sets it apart from other RPGs is the option to complete it without killing anyone—a rare and refreshing concept. Drawing inspiration from *EarthBound*, one of the finest RPGs, it’s clear this game is something special. Plus, its soundtrack is the best I’ve heard in years."
128,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"I recommend this solely because it's free and might offer a more enjoyable experience for others. Personally, the 'game' did nothing for me. Half the story relies on shock value, but I felt neither shocked nor emotionally moved. Perhaps I'm desensitized, or maybe it was too simplistic to elicit a reaction. The other half attempts to depict mental decline through themes of obsession, hallucination, and depression. While the concept is intriguing in theory, the execution fell short. The entire 'game' took me just 10 minutes to complete, even while carefully reading and absorbing every detail."
129,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Do I even need to explain why *Portal* is amazing? It's a puzzle game that introduces a concept and then steps back, offering a brilliant way to challenge your mind while remaining fun. Though not heavily story-driven, it spawned one of the most beloved games of 2011. I still revisit and complete it when bored, marveling at what birthed a legend—and what *is* a legend.  

**Gameplay:** *Portal*'s mechanics are simple to explain. You use portals strategically, alongside buttons that activate puzzle elements. There are two button types: one you press and another requiring a cube."
130,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"If you can overlook the bugs (I personally encountered only two—one minor and the other quite annoying—both now resolved, with one fix boosting my FPS from 60-90 to 80-120) and are seeking a space exploration game, I highly recommend this. Since most reviews focus on specs, here are mine: i5 6600k (~€200), Radeon RX 480 (~€200), Z170 Pro-Gaming (~€150), 16GB DDR4 RAM (~€70). At ~€650, this rig falls within the mid-range price bracket, though it’s relatively new. I maintain nearly constant 60+ FPS on high settings with V-Sync enabled. I’m baffled by claims of overkill setups yielding 20 FPS."
131,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Remember *Age of Mythology*? It’s been ages since we’ve seen an RTS of that caliber. *Divinity: Dragon Commander* comes remarkably close to being my personal favorite. Pair that with a grand strategy mode reminiscent of *Risk*, and it truly delivers. I won’t deny my bias—being able to transform into a dragon, supporting troops, attacking, and managing unit production simultaneously is incredible.  

These days, I appreciate complex RTS games like *Civ V*. Yet, many try to cram intricate mechanics, charts, and resources into a single overwhelming experience."
132,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Undertale combines its elements to create something extraordinary. The retro-style graphics and soundtrack are strong on their own, but together they craft breathtaking, emotional moments. The writing seamlessly shifts from hilarious to tragic to uplifting—often simultaneously—while cleverly subverting RPG conventions. This doesn’t even cover the world, characters, story, or gameplay, each deserving essays of praise. Instead, I’ll keep it simple: if you enjoy RPGs, play this game. If you love video games, play this game. If you have seven spare hours in your lifetime, play this game."
134,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"I’ve only had this game for a few months, yet in that short time, two DLCs have been released alongside patches that transformed an already great game into an exceptional one. The developers are highly engaged with the community, evident in forums and dev diaries. Though the mechanics have a steep learning curve—I’m still mastering them—the depth of strategy offers countless ways to achieve goals and capitalize on situations. To me, the game feels nearly infinitely replayable. Every session draws me in, no matter how the playthrough unfolds."
135,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Warframe is an enjoyable game for the first few hours. After that initial thrill, however, you’ll notice the combat, enemies, and gameplay become repetitive. The standout feature is the developers’ dedication, with semi-frequent updates that introduce sweeping changes, new Warframes, and other tweaks. It’s a solid casual experience, though unlikely to hold your interest beyond a few months unless you love grinding. The best part? It’s free, so it’s worth a try. If you’re after a quick gaming fix, give it a shot."
136,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"This game is incredibly dull. I purchased it believing it was a PC version of *Katamari Damacy*, a beloved PS2 title. Unfortunately, it falls far short. The gameplay involves absorbing progressively larger objects to grow bigger, but the mechanics are clunky, the levels uninspired, and the overall experience feels like a surreal horror show—not the entertaining kind, but one that leaves you questioning existence. Every ""living"" creature, from pets to humans, makes me wonder if the developers had a fascination with taxidermy."
137,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Alright. Let me explain a few things. As someone very interested in politics, I was excited when I first heard about this game. I thought, *Wow! A simulator about becoming president—that sounds fun!* Well, it wasn’t. The game forces you to pick a side: Republican or Democrat, with no independent or third-party option. A little disappointed but still hopeful, I continued to explore. I’ll give the game credit—the character customization, though limited, is fun to experiment with. It’s the only time you can choose whether to wear your head in a campaign. Literally."
138,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Fallout 3’s story was superior. Settlements disrupt the narrative, making you resent babysitting them instead of progressing. Some keys are hardcoded and unchangeable. Bugs are rampant—my Pip-Boy vanished permanently, forcing me to use console commands. Power armor lacks effort; it’s handed to you early, and fusion cores are overly abundant, diminishing its value compared to past games. The story is mediocre, as is most of the game, though it’s more stable than Fallout 3’s frequent crashes. Is it better than Fallout 3? No. New Vegas? No. This title was vastly overhyped for its disappointing quality."

- Enemies always pinpoint your location once spotted  
- Frustratingly godlike enemy accuracy, reminiscent of the first Ghost Warrior  
- Poor checkpoint and save system  
- Unengaging story that fails to hold interest  

Verdict:  
Not recommended unless it’s 90% off—even then, it feels like a tedious chore. I’m only playing to finish it and move on. Given how dull the first Ghost Warrior was (and the relief I felt upon completing it), I doubt I’ll see this one through."

For one thing, I own a Vive and prefer playing room-scale games with motion controllers. Additionally, while the game's vast universe is initially awe-inspiring, I found that same scale hindered my enjoyment.

Recoil and ballistics feel authentic—rifle rounds to the chest, neck, or head are almost always lethal unless they barely graze you. Bullets drop over distance, and controlled bursts are essential for accuracy. No unlimited ammo here: reload mid-magazine too often, and you’ll end up with pouches full of half-empty clips. Sprinting exhausts you, impairing aim until you catch your breath. Stabilize your weapon by resting it on your elbows when prone or on a ledge. Standing reduces accuracy."

Within this family, we identify a tracking solution with a single parameter to simultaneously control transfer fidelity, excited-state population, and robustness.

238,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,paper_abstract,"We investigate the phenomenology of a hypercharge-zero SU(2) triplet scalar, motivated by two-step electroweak symmetry-breaking. We examine scenarios where the triplet is either stable (contributing to dark matter) or decays via Higgs mixing. The stable case is constrained by LHC disappearing-track searches and direct detection experiments, while the decaying triplet faces limits from multilepton collider searches. Our analysis shows that a two-step electroweak phase transition with a stable triplet (having a negative quadratic term) is excluded by direct detection. Additionally, an unstable triplet with a mass below $230\ \mathrm{GeV}$ is ruled out at $95\%$ confidence."
239,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,paper_abstract,"This paper demonstrates that the eccentric debris rings around Fomalhaut and HD 202628 are narrower than predicted by the standard eccentric planet perturbation model (often termed ""pericenter glow""). The conventional scenario assumes an initially circular, narrow belt of planetesimals at semi-major axis \(a\), whose eccentricity is raised to \(e_f\) via secular perturbations from an eccentric planet after gas disc dispersal, producing a belt of width \(2ae_f\). A slight modification allows for narrower belts if planetesimals are initially eccentric, possibly due to earlier planetary perturbations during the gas-rich protoplanetary phase. Alternatively, primordial eccentricity could stem from disc instabilities, independent of planets."
240,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,paper_abstract,"An electron is typically thought to possess only one form of kinetic energy, but could it exhibit additional types due to its spin, charge, or interactions with other electrons? In one dimension (1D), the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) model effectively describes interacting electrons at low energies, yet experimental observations beyond this linear regime remain scarce. Here, we present measurements of many-body modes in 1D gated wires using tunneling spectroscopy. We detect two distinct Fermi seas at high energies, linked to spin and charge excitations, along with three additional 1D ""replica"" modes that intensify as wire length decreases. The effective interaction strength in the wires is tuned by adjusting 1D inter-subband screening by over 45%."

This article introduces *intrinsic*, an R package implementing state-of-the-art likelihood-based estimators for intrinsic dimension. Specifically, the package includes the TWO-NN, Gride, and Hidalgo models. To ensure accessibility, *intrinsic* provides high-level, intuitive functions built upon efficient low-level routines. The package features models divided into two categories: homogeneous and heterogeneous intrinsic dimension estimators. The first category comprises TWO-NN and Gride, with functions supporting both frequentist and Bayesian inference. The second category includes Hidalgo, a Bayesian mixture model, for which an efficient Gibbs sampler is implemented."

Here, we propose and model two physical RC systems: one based on a single magnetic skyrmion memristor (MSM) and another using 24 spin-torque nano-oscillators (STNOs), designed for image classification and nonlinear dynamic system prediction, respectively. Micromagnetic simulations reveal that an RC system employing a single MSM achieves outstanding performance in handwritten digit recognition. Furthermore, a physical RC system comprising 24 STNOs effectively solves complex nonlinear dynamic problems, as demonstrated in second-order nonlinear dynamic and NARMA10 tasks."

This paper reveals an unexpected outcome of popularity-based rankings: the fewer items reporting a signal, the greater their collective share of traffic. This ""few-get-richer"" effect arises when items fall into limited distinct categories (e.g., left-leaning vs. right-leaning news) and are ranked by popularity. We analytically show this effect occurs when users click top-ranked items and exhibit diverse preferences across categories. Through simulations, we examine how the effect’s intensity varies with contextual and behavioral assumptions. We further validate our predictions via an online experiment with human participants. These findings offer critical insights into misinformation dissemination."
245,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,paper_abstract,"Weight pruning is widely recognized as a simple yet effective method to reduce redundancy in deep neural networks (DNNs), enabling acceleration across platforms. However, most pruning techniques compromise between accuracy and regularity, often degrading inference performance and limiting on-device speed. To address this, we introduce pattern-based sparsity—a novel dimension combining pattern and connectivity sparsity—delivering both high accuracy and hardware efficiency. Our meticulously designed patterns enable unprecedented accuracy improvements and enhanced feature extraction across diverse DNN architectures and datasets. Additionally, our framework integrates pattern library extraction, selection, pruning, and weight training seamlessly. This approach naturally aligns with compiler optimizations, ensuring efficient DNN execution on mobile devices."

Creating a more closely matched control group by selecting a subset of the overall controls may reduce bias. We examine this phenomenon through simulations. Specifically, we analyze the impact of mountaintop removal mining (MRM) on mortality using a difference-in-differences approach, leveraging the rise in MRM after the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments. For this analysis, we developed a better-matched control group and obtained a 95% confidence interval encompassing substantial adverse effects, no effect, and minor beneficial effects."

This evaluation can be performed using visual predictive checks (VPC), which involve: (1) simulating multiple replicates of the original study from the model, (2) computing key estimates for each simulated study, and (3) comparing their distribution with the original estimate. This approach is a versatile and generally straightforward method. Here, we explore its application to time-to-event data, particularly when a time-varying covariate is unknown or cannot be approximated post-event."

They navigate complex landscapes like grass effortlessly, maintaining stability. We observed a novel behavior: their body shape allows them to automatically roll sideways to maneuver through artificial grass patches. Robust systems can execute multiple functions with a single structure—revealing yet another remarkable adaptation."

To lift your spirits, let me share one of the great—though often overlooked—commercial success stories of the past two decades. In its own unique way, it rivals the achievements of Microsoft or Google. Moreover, this industry has weathered the current recession with remarkable resilience. I’m referring to organized crime.  

Now, you might argue that organized crime is nothing new—and you’d be right. But over the last 20 years, it has expanded at an unprecedented rate, now accounting for roughly 15% of global GDP. I call it the global shadow economy, or McMafia, for short. So, what fueled this extraordinary rise in cross-border crime?"
291,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"If you ask people which aspect of psychology they find most challenging and mention thinking and emotions, many will say, ""Emotions are incredibly complex—I have no idea how they work. But thinking seems straightforward, just logical reasoning or something. That’s not the hard part."" Here are some problems that arise. One interesting question is: how do we address health? Recently, I read that handshaking might be the leading cause of disease in the West."
292,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"What is a parent? It’s not an easy question. Today, we encounter adoption, stepfamilies, and surrogate mothers. Many parents grapple with difficult questions and decisions. Should we tell our child about the sperm donation? If so, when? What words should we use? Sperm donors are often called ""biological fathers,"" but is ""father"" the right term? As a philosopher and social scientist, I’ve studied these questions about parenthood. Today, I’ll share insights from conversations with parents and children. You’ll see that they understand what truly matters in a family, even if theirs looks a little different."
293,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"When I look in the mirror today, I see a justice and education scholar at Columbia University, a youth mentor, an activist, and a future New York State senator. (Cheers) I see all of that—and a man who spent six years in state prison, starting as a teenager on Rikers Island for an act that nearly cost a man his life. But what brought me here wasn’t the punishment I faced in adult prison or the harshness of our legal system. It was the transformative power of education—a classroom that showed me possibilities I never imagined for myself or our justice system. Weeks before my parole, a counselor urged me to enroll in a college course offered in prison."
294,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"What do you see when you look at me? A woman of faith? A professional? Perhaps even a sister. Or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist. Maybe just an airport security delay—that one’s accurate. (Laughter) If some assumptions were negative, I don’t blame you. Media often portrays people like me this way. Studies reveal 80% of news about Islam and Muslims is negative, and most Americans admit they don’t know a Muslim. Guess people don’t chat with their Uber drivers. (Laughter) For those who’ve never met a Muslim—nice to meet you."
295,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"We need to build a weather service for water. However, without collective demand for accountability, funding incentives will remain absent. The first time I spoke at a conference was here at TED, eight years ago. Fresh out of grad school, I didn’t realize those few minutes onstage would shape the questions I’d face for the next decade. Like many in their twenties, I believed I could solve the world’s problems—particularly water issues—with technology. I had much to learn. It was tempting to think water quality problems persist because they’re difficult to detect. I assumed we only needed simpler, faster, and cheaper sensors. I was wrong."
296,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"For two decades, I worked in finance and knew the industry inside out. The global economy was my life, and I was confident in my expertise. Topics like ecology or apocalyptic scenarios? I dismissed them outright. Then in 2007, something extraordinary happened—the subprime crisis, the collapse of major American banks. It was a wake-up call. I had heated discussions with my wife about my career and the flaws in our financial model. Beyond the crisis, I recognized how wrong I had been—we were steering toward disaster."
299,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"Baking apple pie? Discount Orange Warehouse has you covered! A fruit’s a fruit, right? It’s 1988, and scientist James Hansen has just testified to the United States Congress that global warming trends stem from human activity and will increasingly threaten humanity. Well, well. That’s unusually prescient for a human. Looking for a wedding dress? Try a fresh take on a timeless classic—sleek, flattering, and modest, just like traditional styles. Commercials. Could anything be more insufferable? It’s 1997, and the U.S. Senate holds a hearing on global warming. Expert witnesses note that past eras in Earth’s history were warmer than the 20th century."
300,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"Someone once remarked that politics is essentially ""showbiz for ugly people."" On that note, I suppose I’ve truly arrived. Another point worth considering is what an honor it is, as a politician, to deliver a TED Talk—especially here in the U.K., where politics’ reputation, marred by the expenses scandal, has plummeted. Recently, I even heard scientists considered replacing lab rats with politicians. When asked why, they replied, ""Well, there’s no shortage of politicians, nobody cares what happens to them, and let’s face it—there are things even rats won’t do."" (Laughter) Now, since you all love data, I’ll begin with a data-rich slide."
