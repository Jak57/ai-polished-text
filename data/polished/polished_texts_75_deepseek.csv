Normally, I wouldn’t care, but while flipping channels, I caught a glimpse of Jonathan—equally narcissistic and dull—staring at an empty space on Rodeo Drive, declaring (loudly), ""I’m going to build the greatest salon in the history of the world!""

Re: Loss of Continuity in PX Day-Ahead Auction Due to ISO Rule Changes  

The emergency tariff filing by the California ISO last Friday has negatively impacted the PX day-ahead auction market. The combination of soft and hard caps creates a complete disconnect, posing unacceptable risks to all participants and likely failing to achieve the ISO’s intended reduction in real-time energy sales and procurement. Ultimately, supply will still favor the higher realized price opportunity offered by the ISO. The PX is petitioning Terry Winter of the ISO to promptly permit adjustment bids on any submitted schedule at any relevant price."

Effective immediately, Enron has purchased control area reserves service from BPA. This allows services to sell unit-contingent energy as hourly firm, as BPA supplies reserves for up to 60 minutes.  

If Grays Harbor Paper notifies RT of a unit derate or outage, RT must alert BPA dispatch immediately and adjust the schedule during the next ramp. For example, if Grays’ unit trips at 1333, RT would notify BPA and the sink, reducing the 1400 schedule to zero by the top of the hour.

The order outlines $69 million in 'potential' refunds (requiring payment or cost justification). While Enron was not among the 13 parties cited for overcharging, PGE was ($3.18 million). However, this is not final—the order only addresses January 2001, with further rulings expected for December 2000 and benchmark prices through April 2001. Refund calculations used high prices ($273/MWh, factoring in gas prices, emissions costs, and an assumed heat rate exceeding 16,000).

97,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Magic fans, beware... Wizards seems reluctant to create a compelling digital game. At its heart, *Magic: The Gathering* is a social experience—meant to be shared with friends (or frenemies), filled with laughter, banter, and game-winning plays. Yet Wizards of the Coast appears to have lost sight of this. Playing with friends earns no gold, and gold is crucial—so much so that they’ve imposed a daily cap. While understandable (gold unlocks everything), prepare for a tedious 1v1 grind against AI or silent strangers. If you opt to play for free, expect to spend roughly four hours daily for over a month—alone—just to unlock cards."
98,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"As the third installment in the trilogy, I’ll address the drawbacks first. I generally dislike prequels since they move backward in the narrative rather than forward (a common issue with prequels). That said, they do expand the story. The combat feels less polished and lacks the precision of *Arkham City*. At the time of this review (26/10/2013), a game-breaking bug prevents completing a side mission (though the main story is unaffected). Some gadgets are assigned to awkward hotkeys, forcing your hand to stretch across the keyboard. It may seem minor, but during combat, this can disrupt your flow."
99,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"They significantly improved *Shadow Warrior* (2013). The boss fights are fantastic, and the weapons feel great (though not quite as refined as *DOOM*'s, they're still solid). Enemies aren't overly spongy—unless you mishandle elemental and upgrade mechanics. The balanced upgrade system becomes intuitive without being tedious. Limited ammo and elemental effects encourage varied weapon use. Many unique weapons (a key distinction from *Borderlands*' RNG-based approach) remain viable throughout. The music is stellar, particularly the main theme and Stan Bush's tracks."

My player is an outside scorer, a point guard, 1.71m tall, with maxed stats and all necessary perks. Now, tell me why shooting skill depends on height? Why can’t someone who’s 1.74m be as good at shooting as someone who’s 1.71m? I’m 1.87m in real life, so I made my first player that height—only to discover I couldn’t exceed an 89 rating. Why? That’s pure discrimination! And why doesn’t the game warn me before I create a character, or even when I hit the skill limit after weeks of playing?!?"
101,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"I think *Assassin’s Creed* perfected its mechanics across the board—ship battles, sailing, fishing, parkour, and more. I also felt a stronger connection to this protagonist. While the story begins roughly, it improves significantly as you progress (a trend I’ve noticed in every AC game). Edward was a fascinating character, as were the supporting cast. The collectibles felt meaningful in this installment, unlike previous ones, perhaps because they served a greater purpose. They weren’t mandatory but were enjoyable to pursue, with rewards that felt well-balanced."
102,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"While I can't personally recommend this game, it wasn't completely terrible. The gunplay is decent, provided you can afford the necessary upgrades—my primary criticism being its pay-to-win structure. If I could overlook that, the game could be enjoyable, as the hardsuit is fun and HRV is a brilliant concept. I'd choose this over any Call of Duty title, but its microtransaction model is a dealbreaker for me. If you're fine with this approach, go ahead and enjoy it. But if, like me, you dislike pay-to-win games, skip this one—it's just not for us.""

The save system and risk of sudden death can be frustrating—I lost my main character around hour 10 of my 20-hour playthrough and wished for a reload option. I’ve since used a third-party save tool to avoid catastrophic losses. The aiming reticle is too small, and the zoom feels underpowered. Despite these flaws, it’s been a blast. I’m not usually a zombie fan, but the mix of strategy, missions, and first-person combat is fantastic. I play whenever I can—just one more mission, one more supply run, or escaping to safety before quitting."

The unit variety is impressive—while I’m not sure of the exact count, there’s a ton! The graphics are stunning, the sound design is excellent, and the gameplay is truly epic. The in-game chat box on the main menu is surprisingly entertaining—no joke. However, if you think this game is ""easy"" or you’re new to the genre, expect a steep learning curve.

The original voice actors for Optimus, Megatron, Bumblebee, and others return, instantly recognizable. The iconic transformation sound remains intact. Visually, the cel-shaded style is flawless and quintessentially Generation One. Beyond nostalgia, it’s a genuinely fun game. Combat mechanics are superb—transforming mid-fight is essential and seamlessly integrated into combos, setting it apart from High Moon’s *War for/Fall of Cybertron*. Another standout is the emphasis on melee, though some foes (like Seekers) demand ranged weapons.""

Every time I clicked ""accept"" on the terms of service update, it reappeared, forcing me to restart the client. While not a major issue, requiring a link between my Steam and Gface accounts felt unnecessary—especially since it’s irreversible.

In my opinion, this is a genuinely great and fun game, though the format can be slightly frustrating (like the free-roam city repopulating with enemies after story progress). I especially loved the 'dual play' segments, where you control Batman and another character. The option to switch between controller and mouse/keyboard for tank combat was a welcome touch.

Oh no, you got shot in the face and died—as if that never happens in real life.

The gameplay is solid, the art design is stunning, and the music is surprisingly high-quality and fitting. The story and world are engaging, and the puzzles are enjoyable. But the standout feature is the comedy. Whether you're an RPG veteran or new to the genre, the humor shines through with clever jokes, parodies, and references.

115,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"I'm sorry, but I didn’t enjoy this game despite wanting to support free-to-play and indie developers. The concept seemed perfect for me, but the execution fell flat. As a fan of puzzle and exploration games, I found this one unintuitive—even after consulting guides, the gameplay just wasn’t fun. There’s also no pause button (or it’s too obscure), which is a major flaw given the timed sequences. Additionally, the game feels more like watching cutscenes than playing, leaving me impatient and disengaged."

The narrative wasn’t just a tale; it felt like I was living it, unraveling each twist alongside my character.

1. **No Australian servers** - Constant red-bar connections cause severe lag, putting players at a disadvantage. Even offline training mode stuttered inexplicably. Poor ping makes the game unplayable.  

2. **Excessive artifacting** - Menus, backgrounds, and gameplay are plagued by visual glitches. My GPU, even at stock settings, couldn’t resolve the issue—something I’ve never encountered before."

The atmosphere is immersive, and the collectibles do an excellent job of fleshing out the world. I learned a lot about Batman’s universe, though the lack of bosses was disappointing. Still, future games can address that. The combat strikes a good balance but leans slightly easy. Leveling up Batman felt underwhelming, but upgrading gadgets introduced fresh mechanics. Gaining access to new areas created a satisfying sense of progression."

123,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"I originally bought this game during early development when the only currency was spacebux, and there was no 'tech tree.' Back then, the game was great. All the guns were equally overpowered, so balance wasn’t an issue—everyone could kill anyone at any time. Plus, you had unlimited gun slots and five loadouts. For a game boasting 'bajillions of guns,' you’d expect more than six weapon slots and three loadouts before needing to pay for extras. At one point, I had nearly three pages of guns and was brainstorming new ideas because, for me, that was the fun part."

The game crafts a clear narrative arc for this reimagined hero, making him compelling to follow. The story thrusts Dante into the corrupt world he once ignored, weaving a gripping tale of growth and redemption."

The character design is impeccable, featuring diverse personalities and hidden depths. What sets it apart from other RPGs is the rare option to avoid killing anyone—a refreshing twist. Drawing heavy inspiration from *EarthBound*, one of the finest RPGs, its quality is undeniable. Plus, it boasts the best soundtrack I’ve heard in years."
128,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"I recommend this solely because it's free and may offer a more enjoyable experience for others. Personally, the 'game' did nothing for me. Half the story relies on shock value, but I felt neither shocked nor emotionally moved. Perhaps I'm desensitized, or it was too simplistic to elicit a reaction. The other half attempts to depict mental decline, exploring obsession, hallucination, depression, and more. Theoretically, it's an interesting concept.

And that’s without delving into its world, characters, story, or gameplay—each deserving pages of praise. So here’s my advice: if you enjoy RPGs, play this game. If you love video games, play this game. If you have seven spare hours in your lifetime, play this game."

However, after that initial thrill, you'll notice its combat, enemies, and gameplay become repetitive.

It's a solid casual game, though unlikely to hold your interest beyond a few months unless you love grinding. The best part? It's free, so it's worth a try. If you're seeking a quick gaming fix, give it a shot."

The gameplay revolves around absorbing progressively larger objects to grow bigger, but the execution is clunky, the levels lack creativity, and the overall tone is a surreal horror show—not the entertaining kind, but one that leaves you feeling bleak and questioning existence. Every ""living"" creature, from small pets to humans, makes me wonder if the developers had a fascination with taxidermy."

A simulator about becoming president? That sounds fun!"" Well, it wasn’t. The game forces you to pick a side—Republican or Democrat—with no independent or third-party option. A little disappointed but still hopeful, I continued to see what it offered. I’ll give the game credit: the character customization, though limited, is fun to experiment with.

Recoil and ballistics are realistic—single hits to the chest, neck, or head from rifle-caliber weapons are almost always fatal unless it's a graze.

For $n$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-like states, the most robust witness requires $n+1$ local measurement settings and tolerates up to $1/2$ white noise.

244,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,paper_abstract,"Ranking algorithms are vital for online platforms, from search engines to recommender systems. This paper reveals an unexpected outcome of popularity-based rankings: the fewer items sharing a signal, the greater their collective traffic share. This ""few-get-richer"" effect arises when items belong to limited distinct classes (e.g., left- vs. right-leaning news) and are ranked by popularity. We analytically show this occurs when users favor top-ranked items and exhibit heterogeneous class preferences. Through simulations, we examine how the effect's strength varies with contextual and behavioral assumptions. We also validate our predictions via an online experiment. These findings offer critical insights into misinformation spread."
245,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,paper_abstract,"Weight pruning is widely recognized as a simple yet effective method to reduce redundancy in deep neural networks (DNNs), enabling acceleration across platforms. However, most pruning techniques trade model accuracy for regularity, resulting in compromised inference accuracy and limited on-device acceleration. To address this, we introduce pattern-based sparsity—a new dimension combining pattern and connectivity sparsity—delivering both high accuracy and hardware efficiency. Through carefully designed patterns, our pruning method consistently enhances accuracy and improves feature extraction across diverse DNN architectures and datasets. Our framework simultaneously handles pattern library extraction, selection, pruning, and weight training. This approach naturally aligns with compiler optimizations, enabling efficient DNN execution on mobile platforms."
246,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,paper_abstract,"Difference-in-differences analysis with a control group that significantly differs from the treated group risks bias due to historical events affecting the groups differently. Creating a more closely matched control group—by selecting a subset of the overall controls—can reduce this bias. We examine this phenomenon through simulations. Specifically, we analyze the impact of mountaintop removal mining (MRM) on mortality using a difference-in-differences approach, leveraging the rise in MRM after the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments. For this analysis, we constructed a better-matched control group and obtained a 95% confidence interval spanning substantial adverse effects, no effect, and minor beneficial effects."
247,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,paper_abstract,"When building models to summarize clinical data for simulations, it is essential to assess their ability to reproduce the data. This can be achieved using visual predictive checks (VPCs), which involve (1) simulating multiple replicates of the original study from the evaluated model, (2) computing key estimates for each simulated study, and (3) comparing their distribution with the original estimate. This approach is a versatile and generally straightforward method. Here, we explore its application to time-to-event data, particularly when a time-varying covariate is unknown or cannot be approximated post-event."

We demonstrate how similar protocols, combining repeated quantum measurements and dynamical decoupling control pulses, can: (i) confine and protect quantum dynamics from decoherence in line with Zeno physics; (ii) analytically predict the probability of transferring a quantum system into a target state via stochastic sequential measurements; and (iii) optimally reconstruct the spectral density of environmental noise by orthogonalizing frequency-domain filter functions for quantum sensors. These advancements will improve our ability to observe and manipulate open quantum systems, driving progress in quantum science and technology."
