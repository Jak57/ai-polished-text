Hairstylist Jonathan Antin wants to open a second location in Beverly Hills, and I find myself captivated by his grandiose ambitions. As I flipped through channels, I caught a glimpse of Jonathan boasting about his plans for the salon, and I was hooked. Not since Rocco have I found such a charismatic fool on TV."

I'm not too happy right now, but I'll get better. My mom's surgery went okay. Her eyesight has come back some. She can see fuzzy shapes and make out colors.

I just morosely ripped it out and watched season two of Sex and the City instead (good choice!). And then I got sick of it and threw it away.

He contends that shifting the focus to place can create a more grounded community. So far, this book has been the most captivating read of the semester."

I completed three titles: Bruce Sterling's 'Heavy Weather,' Larry Niven's 'World of Ptavvs,' and Octavia Butler's 'Parable of the Sower.' While 'Heavy Weather' offered a compelling cyberpunk narrative with well-crafted characters, I failed to experience any profound emotional resonance.

Post-practicum trauma was a hidden epidemic that is only now being acknowledged. I was burdened by my experience, but meeting with the course coordinator allowed me to release my burden and prevent another student from suffering the same fate. Yesterday, I ran into a fellow classmate who was determined to go to the student who was scheduled to go to my old school for their practicum and warn them of the difficulties. I calmed her down and advised her to speak to the administrator first."

I returned to my studies and, just as I was finding a little glimmer of understanding buried in my subconscious, the doorbell rang again. Bam, just like that, my breakthrough disappeared.

As a non-American blogger, I've been hesitant to join in on these discussions, particularly those involving flags, but since I started this topic (the subject, not the act of flag-burning), I suppose I should say something. Firstly, I believe that having a law against flag-burning is nonsensical. When you grant a symbol automatic reverence and protection, you're taking a small but significant step towards totalitarianism. Symbols are fleeting and subjective - their meaning is derived from how they are perceived, not intrinsic to them. Burning a flag may be seen as disrespectful to some, but to others, it can be a powerful form of free speech. It's important to recognize that symbols can have multiple meanings and to respect the right to express those meanings, even if we don't agree with them."

In the old days, when we were asked for resolutions evidencing the authority to enter into the master agreement/derivative transactions, we would frequently receive the resolutions that did not allow the counterparties to enter into currency transactions. Since transacting these currency transactions with our energy customers is a new area of business for us, I just wanted us all to be mindful to check these old resolutions and not to rely solely on the ""restrictions"" contained in Lotus notes.


It's important to review and understand the resolutions that govern our master agreement and derivative transactions, as they may have changed over time. By doing so, we can ensure that we are operating in compliance with our agreements and avoid any potential issues or disputes.
In addition, it's important to note that the resolutions may have been superseded or updated since the last time they were reviewed. Therefore, it's important to verify the latest versions of the resolutions and ensure that they are being followed in our transactions.

By taking these steps, we can ensure that our transactions are accurate, complete, and compliant with our agreements, which can help to build trust and strengthen our relationships with our energy customers."

From August to September 2000, the rate schedule yields a larger commodity charge due to SDG&E customers receiving a lump-sum reimbursement from SDG&E over those two months. As a result, SDG&E customers can expect lower electric bills. Assuming the lump-sum reimbursement is not included in the implicit energy component, the average for June 2000 through January 2001 is 6.2 cents, and the implicit commodity average from February 2001 through December 2001 is 7.3 cents.

I would prefer playing this over any Call of Duty title, but the pay-to-win model is off-putting for me. If you're okay with this model, then by all means, have fun.

The number of units is great, with a considerable amount. Graphics and sounds are impressive, and the gameplay is epic. The in-game chat box at the main menu is entertaining too. However, don't be fooled if you think this game is easy, as it can take time to get used to it, especially if you're new to the strategy genre.

The voice actors for Optimus Prime, Megatron, Bumblebee, and many others are back, and instantly recognizable. The distinctive cartoon transformation sound is also present. Graphically, the cell-shaded presentation is perfect, and very reminiscent of the original Generation One style. However, aside from that, it's actually a very fun game. The combat mechanics are well-done, with transforming mid-fight being a necessity, and seamlessly integrated into combos. It's quite different from High Moon's excellent War for Cybertron games. Another notable aspect is the heavy focus on melee combat, but some enemies, such as the Seekers, require a switch to a ranged blaster."

It sounds like Apex Legends is a game that offers a lot of content and frequent updates, which can be both a pro and a con depending on the player's perspective. On the one hand, the frequent updates can provide a lot of new content and changes to keep the game fresh and exciting, which can be appealing to players who enjoy trying out new things and experiencing different playstyles. On the other hand, the frequent updates can also mean that the game can feel unstable or unpolished, especially if the changes are significant, which can be frustrating for players who prefer a more polished and stable gaming experience.
It's also worth noting that the game is free to play, so it's a good option for players who are looking for a casual gaming experience without breaking the bank.

The game's creators have a unique approach to level design, where they try to make the levels as surreal and thought-provoking as possible, rather than simply focusing on action and challenge. This can make the game feel more like a psychological horror experience, where the player is forced to confront their own subconscious fears and insecurities.


The game's use of ""living"" creatures, including pets, also adds to the surreal and unsettling atmosphere, as it makes the player feel like they are interacting with living beings that are somehow ""alive"" and have their own thoughts and feelings. This can be unsettling and make the player question their own relationship with the world around them.

While the war has been controversial, with many arguing that it has not achieved its stated goals of disarming Saddam Hussein's regime and creating a stable democracy in the region, Cardinal Murphy-O'Connor's focus on the human cost of the conflict is a reminder that the war has also had a significant impact on the lives of ordinary people in Iraq and the wider Middle East.
The cardinal's comments echo those of the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. Rowan Williams, who has also spoken out against the war in Iraq.

Under this identification, vector mesons play the role of the chern-Simons vector fields living on the quantum Hall droplet that forms the n_f=1 baryon. The proposed current is the effective expression for the baryon current at low energies. This proposal provides a unified picture for the two types of baryons and enables them to continuously transform one into the other in a natural way.

242,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,paper_abstract,"Estimating the intrinsic dimension of a dataset is a crucial step in many dimensionality reduction techniques. This article introduces intrinsic, an r package with novel likelihood-based estimators. The package includes three models: two-nn, gride, and hidalgo. These models fall into two categories: homogeneous and heterogeneous intrinsic dimension estimators. The functions for these models provide inference under both frequentist and Bayesian frameworks. The hidalgo model is a Bayesian mixture model with an efficient Gibbs sampler."
243,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,paper_abstract,"Spintronic nanodevices exhibit ultrafast nonlinear dynamics on a nanosecond scale, promising to enable spintronic reservoir computing (RC) systems. Two physical RC systems based on a single magnetic skyrmion memristor (MSM) and 24 spin-torque nano-oscillators (STNO) were proposed and modeled to perform image classification and nonlinear dynamic system prediction. Micromagnetic simulations revealed that a single MSM can achieve outstanding performance in handwritten digit recognition, while a physical RC system consisting of 24 STNOs can effectively solve complex unknown nonlinear dynamic problems."

A surprising consequence: the fewer items reporting a signal, the higher their collective traffic share. This few-get-richer effect emerges when there are few item classes and people tend to click on top-ranked items, with heterogeneous preferences. We analyze the effect's strength with simulations and experimentally test our predictions. Our findings have implications for understanding the spread of misinformation."
245,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,paper_abstract,"Weight pruning has been widely recognized as a simple and effective method to reduce redundancy in deep neural networks (DNNs), leading to improved performance on various platforms. However, most pruning techniques are trade-offs between model accuracy and regularity, resulting in impaired inference accuracy and limited on-device acceleration. To address this, we introduce a new sparsity dimension, pattern-based sparsity, which combines pattern and connectivity sparsity. Our approach achieves unprecedented accuracy enhancement and better feature extraction ability on various DNN structures and datasets, while also improving hardware efficiency. Our pattern-aware pruning framework naturally lends itself to compiler optimization for efficient DNN execution on mobile platforms."
246,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,paper_abstract,"Difference-in-differences analysis with a control group that is more closely matched to the treated group can help to reduce bias in the analysis. This is because the control group should be comparable to the treated group in terms of all relevant factors that could affect the outcome of interest, such as demographics, socioeconomic status, and environmental conditions. By matching the control group to the treated group in these factors, the analysis can account for any differences between the two groups that are not due to the treatment itself, but rather to other factors that may affect the outcome of interest.

In the given passage, the authors are conducting a difference-in-differences analysis to study the effect of mountaintop removal mining (MRM) on mortality. They are using a control group that is more closely matched to the treated group in terms of various factors, such as demographics and socioeconomic status, to reduce the potential for bias in the analysis. The authors are also using a 95% confidence interval to indicate the range of possible effects of MRM on mortality, with a range of effects that includes both adverse and beneficial effects, as well as no effect."
250,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"I can't imagine anyone who only has one interest in life. Most people have multiple pursuits and adapt their careers as needed. (around 15% of American workers don't have traditional full-time jobs.) They may work part-time, contract, or as temps. The term ""side hustle"" fits this ethos, as people combine different activities to make a living. The word ""side hustle"" originated in African American newspapers in the 1920s, where it referred to a scam. By the 1950s, it came to mean legitimate work as well. A side hustle differs from a second job in that it's more flexible and often pursued in addition to a primary career."

Confessing, apologizing, and implicating others may secure your freedom. This was the choice faced by those accused of witchcraft in Salem, Massachusetts between February 1692 and May 1693. Paranoia, misdirected religious fervor, and a justice system valuing repentance over truth led to their persecution.

When we equipped them with jet packs or subjected them to earthquakes, we discovered that their exquisitely tuned legs allowed them to maintain balance without cognitive effort. They effortlessly traverse complex terrain, like grass, without becoming destabilized. We recently observed a novel behavior, where their unique body shape causes them to automatically roll to their side to navigate through artificial test environments."
