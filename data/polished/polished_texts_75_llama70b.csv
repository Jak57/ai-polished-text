1,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"Another week has flown by. I drove past the new house yesterday and noticed the front window was covered in boxes. We may receive the keys at closing, and I'm getting increasingly excited. If everything goes smoothly this week, we'll be set for closing a week from Wednesday. I stayed up late last night, watching movies with Bethany until after 3:00am. There's been a movie marathon going on around here lately. Here's my rundown: last night we watched ""Thirteen,"" a film every mother of a teenager should see. It exceeded my expectations."
2,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"Summer TV used to be a dead zone filled with repeats, but now there are two great new shows that I've been watching religiously for the past week. One of them is ""Blow Out,"" a show with a concept that seems to be the most unlikely, yet it has captured my attention. The show revolves around hairstylist Jonathan Antin, who wants to build a second location for his popular West Hollywood salon, this time in Beverly Hills. Normally, this wouldn't be of interest to me, but as I was flipping through the channels, I caught a glimpse of Jonathan, who appears to be equally narcissistic and dull, standing in an empty space on Rodeo Drive, proclaiming in a public voice, ""I'm going to build the greatest salon in the history of the world ever!"" and I was hooked. Not since ""Rocco"" have I found such a moron so compelling to watch."
3,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"What a week... I've developed tendonitis in my right shoulder, just under my shoulder blade. The pain is exacerbated when I move my arm excessively, particularly when using a computer mouse. Unfortunately, I've been on a marathon updating my website and working on other online projects, which has left me with limited mobility. I'm struggling to muster the strength to draw anything. The lack of sleep isn't helping, either. I'm not in the best of spirits, but I'm optimistic about recovery. On a more positive note, my mom's surgery was successful. Her eyesight has partially returned, allowing her to see fuzzy shapes and distinguish colors. Although she's still largely blind, I'm hopeful she'll regain her full vision soon."
4,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"The kindness of strangers is truly remarkable. Today, I attempted to do laundry with my kids in tow, and it quickly turned into a chaotic ordeal. However, I was reminded of the incredible sweetness of strangers who show kindness for no reason other than the sake of being kind. I'm not talking about people with ulterior motives; these individuals genuinely wanted to help. I was a mess, covered in kid drool and wearing my worn-out laundry day outfit. I'm also not exactly feeling fresh, so there was no incentive for them to be nice. As I sit at my desk, I'm multitasking - composing this post and watching No Doubt music videos."
5,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"It's 11:14pm MST, and I'm sitting in my bedroom, fixing the personal computer of our personnel director from work. I don't mind doing favors, but I often wonder how frequently I end up fixing someone else's computer. I'm glad to be able to show love and care for people in this way. However, I sometimes question where the line is drawn between being helpful and being taken advantage of. The last couple of weeks, I've been staying up late reading, so I was looking forward to an early night. Instead, I realized it would be more prudent to return the computer to its owner. No rest for the weary, indeed. I found myself watching Joe Schmo 2 again tonight."
6,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"Remind me, what did I write about before this? Or, a continuation in the 'is this a date?' saga. After the awkward lunch, my confidence took a hit. I forgot to share an important part of the story with you guys. Before Pat arrived for lunch, Dustin started talking about what a great guy Pat is and how he's trying to find him a girlfriend. As I listened and nodded, I realized we were spending more time discussing finding Dustin's best friend a partner than engaging in typical small talk with a stranger over pink lemonade. I excused myself to the bathroom, looked in the mirror, and silently asked myself: am I being pawned off to the other guy? Is this what happens now?"
7,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"I wish everyone would think before acting. Ideally, each person would make a conscious decision to think critically from the moment they wake up, and maintain that mindset throughout the day. If they're not willing to do so, I'd prefer they reconsider their daily activities. I'm frustrated with the prevalence of thoughtless behavior. While I don't claim to be the most intelligent person, I believe it's reasonable to expect a basic level of critical thinking. I'll focus on a few specific examples for now and save others for another time. I'd like to keep this discussion concise and targeted."
8,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"Two issues with the scenario outlined in my previous post: 

1. Although Bush is stimulating the economy, it's being done in an unfavorable manner. Robert Rubin, in an interview with NPR's Marketplace, suggested that the same stimulus effect could have been achieved without the long-term debt burden by implementing temporary tax cuts that would benefit low- and middle-income individuals. Robert Rubin's insight is indeed valuable. It's challenging to think of a Bush administration cabinet official on the domestic side who possesses a similar level of gravitas.

2. We cannot afford to give Republicans control solely during wartime, as they have cleverly devised an endless, global 'war on terrorism.'"
10,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"Do you ever have one of those moments when you begin to reflect on life? Like when you're sitting in math class, feeling utterly bored, and you wonder what exactly goes on in your brain that enables you to comprehend math? You realize that you exist, and you're in math class, and you can't help but wonder why. Then it hits you - the sheer amazement of existing. And suddenly, it dawns on you that this random train of thought is somewhat pitiful. Ever had that happen? I find it frustrating. You know what else I dislike? Block schedules. Who would ever conceive such an idea? It's clear that sitting through a two-and-a-half-hour class in any subject is a form of cruel and unusual punishment."

Tonight, Andy beat me by a few small dollars and won the game, or maybe I let him win since he's leaving in a few short hours and I wanted him to feel good on his last night here. However the story goes, it can't compare to this Texas-sized headache I have at the moment. I've taken some Aleve, and I must say that they're doing the trick. All I need now is some well-deserved rest and relaxation. Your telephone's the one that helped me wrap the cord around your neck... At the drive-in."
12,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"Today's been a long day, having driven home from Indiana. I'll have to be selective about what I write, as I could easily fill a lot of space and time, but I'm running low on energy. To start, I must say that camp exceeded my expectations - it was truly awesome. Lately, God has been working wonders in my life, and it's been incredible. I've undergone a significant transformation, but I'll get back to the beginning. We arrived at the Twiggs' house on Friday evening and stayed until we left for camp on Monday. During our visit, we attended the fair, church, a parade, went to Walmart, and watched movies."
13,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"Today marks the end of my summer vacation, and I'm not exactly thrilled about it. I have a dentist appointment scheduled for 9 am, which I'm not looking forward to, but I'd rather get it over with now than try to squeeze it in during the first month of my surgery rotation. I'm feeling anxious and apprehensive about the upcoming school year. As a perfectionist, I strive to excel in everything I do, but starting new things can be daunting. I dislike feeling uncertain and out of control, like a pawn on a chessboard. I've always been someone who likes to take charge and make my own moves, but this new chapter is uncharted territory for me."
14,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"Arun Shourie discusses how the current Governor of Uttar Pradesh had warned as far back as 1996 about the impending threat of the rise of a 'third Islamic state' in the subcontinent. T V Rajeswar, the former head of the Intelligence Bureau and the present Governor of Uttar Pradesh, had predicted this dire threat in a series of articles published in the Hindustan Times in 1996. Shourie raises a valid point when he questions whether the fact that Rajeswar, rather than himself or Mr. Advani, wrote these warnings makes them more credible. Does this revelation lend truth to the warnings, or does it lead to the conclusion that Rajeswar is a closet communalist, unfit to continue as Governor of Uttar Pradesh?"
15,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"Attitude: bored, mood: indifferent, looking forward to tonight. It's been a long, arduous day in the trenches, leaving little time to write for our readers. However, it's great to see Tigger (now Akcron) taking the reins and making an appearance, discussing various topics. Yesterday's Shakespeare on the Green was a lovely play, although I had to leave before the closing curtain, which was disappointing. Hopefully, I'll get to see a complete Shakespeare play someday. Akcron is right about the shower issues; it's a problem. The look people get when enduring self-inflicted discomfort can be quite amusing, I must admit. I'm glad to see her tackling the topic."
16,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"Over the past two days, I've been experiencing severe bouts of exhaustion. It's a bone-deep fatigue that's left me feeling drained. Last evening, I returned home and fell asleep, only waking up when my mother called me around 8:30. When I awoke, the room was dark, and I hadn't turned on the lights, so I was disoriented for a few seconds. All I could focus on was my mother's voice in the darkness as I struggled to regain my bearings. I'm still trying to understand why I'm feeling so exhausted. This morning, the weather was pleasant, with a gentle drizzle when I arrived. In contrast, I've heard that Calcutta has been experiencing rain for the past three days."
17,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"Last night was the worst. I discarded the sweater I was knitting, having only completed about 14 inches. I lost approximately $10 worth of yarn, which costs $8 per skein. However, the project had become unmanageable, with too many stitches by the time I reached the armholes, and the mohair was prone to knotting, making it difficult to frog the rows. The yarn broke frequently, causing frustration. I remained surprisingly calm, listening to season two of Sex and the City, courtesy of the library. Eventually, I grew tired of it and threw the sweater away. I suppose I could say I gained valuable experience from the attempt. The yarn was a loss, and I didn't even swear, which is unusual for me."
18,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"Last night in class, we discussed that week's assigned reading, ""Getting Back into Place: Toward a Renewed Study of the Place-World"" by Edward S. Casey. The first chapter explores ""implacement"" and the second, ""displacement."" Casey distinguishes that our contemporary world and culture revolve around time as the situating force, citing phrases like ""we are running out of time,"" ""we have saved time,"" and ""we are just in time."" He argues that using place as the center of culture fosters a more grounded community. This is a rough summation, and I offer this disclaimer in case my professor or classmates read this post. So far, this book is the first reading that has truly resonated with me."
19,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"Whatever it is they put into freeze pops to make them those colours, there should be some sort of warning: may make your life a bit bizarre. And whilst giggling is good, one wonders if we would have found ourselves up that fire escape drinking beer in the fierce wind had we not been eating them earlier. We stumbled upon a doorway to a bar, sadly closed for business, and paused to examine an office-supplies catalogue that had arrived in the post. Lucky we did. Who could possibly have guessed that within these pages were the special offers of a lifetime? I list but a few: buy 36 permanent marker pens, get a stunt kite. Buy 30 lever arch files, get a barbecue."
20,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"Currently listening to: ""The Little Drummer Boy"" by Stevan Pasero. Now, onto my post. Senate Republicans, hands up - who watched the 39-hour judicial nominations marathon last week? I must admit, I didn't. However, I did tune in briefly a couple of times. The entire ordeal was a colossal waste of time, orchestrated by Republicans who were upset that Democrats wouldn't nominate four of Bush's judicial picks. They attempted to score political points by holding a multi-day protest. Notably, Democrats have already approved 168 of Bush's judicial nominees. Nevertheless, this wasn't enough for the Republicans, who seem to be under the illusion that they have a significant mandate for such actions."
21,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"This was a good weekend. I spent a lot of time outdoors, after a long time, and I also listened to a lot of Nevermore (something I should have started doing much earlier) and read extensively. I finished three books over the weekend - Bruce Sterling's Heavy Weather, Larry Niven's World of Ptavvs, and Octavia Butler's Parable of the Sower. Heavy Weather was a good cyberpunk romp through a near-future USA, devastated by global warming and general anarchy. While it was clever, well-paced, and altogether very convincing, I must confess that I failed to come away with any really significant sensations about the story or the characters. Not that both aren't well constructed and vividly etched - it's a good book, but not a great one, I guess."
22,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"The aftermath of the first week back from practicum was a struggle, but it's only in the second week that the smoke has really started to clear. Post-practicum trauma, a hidden epidemic, is only now coming to light. I was stricken, but an eventual meeting with the course co-ordinator allowed me to release my burden. By doing so, I have prevented another person from being stuck with a pedagogically deficit practicum school. Yesterday, I bumped into another aggrieved classmate who was determined to warn the student due to attend her school in the next practicum about the terrible experience. I calmed her down, suggesting we should first approach the administrator."
23,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"Things are incredibly busy here at times, but there's always time for stress-relieving activities. I've discovered that I'm not very skilled at 8-ball and ping pong. Rick, the Canadian, consistently beats me, and we often play a quick round on the ping pong table in our building's front lobby. Last night, I participated in an 8-ball tournament at the recreation tent, which we call the hot spot. It's equipped with a popcorn machine, multiple TVs, a jukebox, DVD rentals, a pool table, a dartboard, and a ping pong table. I did fairly well in my one game until I scratched on the eight ball. Despite that, I still had a good time, especially with the two Dutch soldiers who joined the tournament."
24,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"Fall 1974: I was attempting, for what felt like the 13th time, to fight my way through the second chapter of my high school algebra book. As someone who has never been inclined towards math, I found myself struggling to make sense of it. My aversion to math is undeniable. Just as I was starting to grasp a concept, the doorbell rang, prompting me to put down my book and answer it. However, upon opening the door, I found no one there. I returned to my studies, only to have the doorbell ring again just as I was gaining a glimmer of understanding. My breakthrough vanished instantly. I went to the door once more, only to find it empty. This was the last thing a struggling math student like myself needed – an uninvited practical joker disrupting my already fragile focus."
25,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"This past week has been nothing short of exhausting. I spent Tuesday through Thursday completing the move to my new classroom. The new room is bigger and closer to my grade level team, which are essential factors to consider as I invest hours in preparing my room for this year. Had I known about the move prior to the end of my school year, I would have discarded many of the books and supplies I no longer use. Unfortunately, they all came with me. So this week was spent moving, unpacking, and purging extensively. I have to thank my teammate Jill for her assistance with all of this. You see, she was still teaching this month in my old room. So she and her lovely students moved almost my entire room for me, which was a huge help."

Even if we never had a child, never married, or never officially paired, my love for you was immense, and its echo still resonates in my heart. I'll always be reminded of the few nights we spent together, our hearts and limbs entwined in a soulful embrace, under the salty darkness of a beach evening or a kiss in the rain. Whenever a pang of sorrow pierces my heart, you'll be there, that piece of you bleeding the eternal love that once lived in me and still remains."

I'm not entirely convinced by the article's premise, which makes it difficult for me to fully immerse myself in it. I struggle to grasp the underlying passion and angst that drives it. Growing up in a country where questioning authority was discouraged, I'm not accustomed to exercising my freedom of speech. In my homeland, asking questions could lead to severe repercussions, including imprisonment under internal security acts. This newfound freedom to question openly is unfamiliar to me.

28,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"We had an outing yesterday with my colleagues at the bank to Guintubdan, La Carolota. For most of us, it was our first time visiting the area. We embarked on a trek to the falls, which took around 30 minutes, leaving us all breathless. However, the exhaustion was worth it as we finally reached our destination. The icy water was invigorating, causing our bodies to numb from the cold. We only stayed for less than an hour before heading to the nearby waterfalls, which required another 30 minutes of trekking. The trip was worth it, as the falls exuded a calming ambiance and the scenery was breathtaking. It felt like being one with nature, and the experience was truly rejuvenating. The cold air and water were so soothing that they could lull you to sleep. We were all catching our breaths. Whew! but we made it. You can feel your body getting numb because of the coldness. Soaking myself in the cold water was like communing with mother earth."

With only a month left before Ed leaves, I think the reality of the situation is starting to sink in for Ed and the rest of us. To be honest, it hit me a long time ago.

Fortunately, I had brought a bag of eggs as a precaution. As a result, Connor still had a great time searching for eggs in the park. The next morning, he woke up excited, believing the Easter bunny had visited. Witnessing the excitement on a child's face is truly heartwarming. Following the egg hunt, we attended church as a family. Although the Easter bunny is a fun tradition, we ensure our children understand the true meaning of the holiday."

However, my day took a turn for the worse when I got a flat tire. Luckily, I'm at work, and my colleagues are going to inflate it for me and check if it holds air.

They may think they can read our emotions and know us inside out, but the truth is, they don't. After a recent argument with Nicole about Kelli, I went upstairs, and my parents asked me what was wrong. I felt like saying, ""Can't you just give me some space?"" I don't owe them an explanation every time. The situation with Nicole and Kelli is simple: they don't get along."

This may not be relevant to anyone outside of this area, so I'll spare the details. I'm relieved to be sitting here instead of stuck in my car. Yesterday, Sara decided to Google me and discovered that an email I wrote to Ivan Maisel on ESPN.com was published online.

I managed to catch it on the opening day, right after school on Friday - thanks to Mike for the ticket. Daniel Radcliffe, who plays Harry Potter, has grown up so quickly and is quite charming. Malfoy, too, was quite entertaining. The movie was great overall, but I would give it 4.5 stars as some important details were left out.

Observers will come from the OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights. This will be the first time such a team has been present for a U.S. presidential election. A group of congressional Democrats, including four New Yorkers, has petitioned U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to dispatch international observers to Florida to oversee this year's presidential balloting there. I humbly disagree. Based on available information, the OSCE seems to be coming to learn from the U.S. election process, not to oversee it, which was the original partisan and childish call for U.N."

I'm relieved to have the morning off, but I do need to call a man at KMIZ to obtain his rate card. Tonight, I'm looking forward to spending time with two of my closest friends, Amy and Kate, and hopefully squeezing in some study time.

A citizenship ceremony in Jacksonville, attended by nearly 200 people, seemed to proceed as usual, with the crowd leaving as new Americans. However, just before the new citizens departed the June 29 event, an immigration official directing the swearing-in ceremony encouraged them to visit a voter registration table, a common sight at naturalization ceremonies. 

The table, however, was unusual in that it was staffed by Republican volunteers, and the party affiliation box on the registration forms had been pre-checked to make all new voters members of the GOP. This raised suspicions, particularly for Linda Cross, who was in attendance to watch her husband, Dario Cruz, take his citizenship oath. The incident has led to complaints and calls for the relocation of recruitment naturalization ceremonies in Jacksonville."

The illustration aspect is the icing on the cake – I'd probably complain more if that hadn't fallen into place. I'm aware that I'm not being fairly compensated, though.

As a non-American blogger, I've been hesitant to engage in certain discussions, particularly those surrounding flags. However, since I initiated the topic, I feel compelled to share my thoughts. Firstly, I believe that enacting a law against flag-burning is utterly absurd. The moment you grant a symbol - any symbol - automatic reverence and protection, you've taken a small yet significant step towards totalitarianism. Symbols are inherently subjective - they don't inherently represent anything; their meaning is derived from perception or assigned representation."

The story was retold, but it lacked a gripping quality, and I didn't feel like I gained anything from watching it. The character development was also somewhat weak.

Although she was only here for a week, her presence was truly felt, and I mean that in the best possible way. Working on the scrapbook from our trip to Tasmania brings back fond memories of a time that feels like just yesterday - last week, in fact. Perhaps it's the thought of not seeing her for a while, with her moving to Bristol in September or October, that's making me feel this way. She represented a deeper connection to my family back home.

Re: Loss of Continuity in PX Day-Ahead Auction due to ISO Rule Changes 

The emergency tariff filing by the California ISO last Friday has negatively impacted the PX Day-Ahead Auction market. The combination of soft and hard caps has resulted in a complete disconnect, posing unacceptable risks to all participants. This change is unlikely to achieve the ISO's desired reduction in real-time energy sales and procurement. Instead, supply will likely continue to favor the higher realized price opportunity offered by the ISO. The PX is petitioning Terry Winter of the ISO to allow for immediate adjustment bids on any submitted schedule at any relevant price."

The order only addresses January 2001 and promises further orders regarding December 2000 and benchmark prices through April 2001. The prices used to determine refunds were relatively high, at $273/MWh, based on gas prices, emissions costs, and an assumed heat rate of over 16,000."

Absolutely amazing, I have nothing negative to say about this game as it has exceeded my expectations and will likely exceed yours too. The game features fluid movement, is bug and crash-free, and offers a wealth of story content and options for each day, including multiple practices, events such as sponsorships, and games. This review is based solely on my experience with MyCareer, and so far, it's a perfect 10/10. The Facescan feature worked well for me, although the first attempt resulted in an unusual forehead shape. Using the MyNBA2K17 app allows for free Facescan and daily VC earnings. #sellout"
97,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Magic fans, be warned: Wizards seems hesitant to create a decent digital game. At its core, Magic: The Gathering is a social experience meant to be enjoyed with friends, sharing laughter, playful jabs, and thrilling victories. However, Wizards of the Coast appears to have lost sight of this. When playing with friends, you're unable to earn gold, a crucial in-game currency. Gold is so vital that a daily cap has been implemented, which is understandable given its role in unlocking in-game content. But be prepared for a monotonous 1v1 grind against the computer or random opponents, with whom you can't even communicate."
98,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Being the third installment in the trilogy, I'll address the drawbacks first. I generally dislike prequels, as they technically move the story backward rather than forward, which is an inherent issue with this genre. However, they often provide additional story depth. The combat feels somewhat unrefined and lacks the sharpness that Arkham City achieved. As of my writing this recommendation (26/10/2013), a game-breaking bug exists, preventing the completion of a side mission, although the main storyline remains unaffected. Some gadgets are assigned to inconvenient hotkeys, requiring excessive keyboard navigation, which can disrupt combos during combat."
99,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"They essentially perfected Shadow Warrior (2013). The boss fights are impressive, and the weapons feel solid, although not quite as exceptional as those in D44M. Enemies are not overly resilient, provided you effectively manage elemental and upgrade aspects. The upgrade system is well-balanced, and once you grasp it, it's not too tedious. The elemental mechanics and limited ammo encourage the use of diverse weapons. There are many unique and cool weapons that remain viable throughout the game. The music is excellent, particularly the main theme and Stan Bush's contributions."
101,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"I think this Assassin's Creed has perfected its mechanics across the board, from ship battles and sailing to hunting and parkour. I found myself more invested in the protagonist than in previous games. Although the story begins on a rough note, it significantly improves as the game progresses - a trend I've noticed in every AC game. Edward is a fascinating character, and the supporting cast is equally well-developed. The collectibles in this game feel more meaningful than in previous installments, possibly due to their greater significance in the overall narrative. While not required, they're enjoyable to collect and reward the player in a balanced manner. The initial rough start to the story does get much better as you play. Edward and the side characters are quite interesting."
102,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"While I personally cannot recommend this game, it wasn't absolutely terrible. The gunplay is passable, provided you have the means to purchase gun parts. This is my primary concern with the game: its pay-to-win model. If I could overlook this, the game would be enjoyable, as the hardsuit is fun to use and the HRV concept is excellent. I'd prefer this game over any Call of Duty title, but its pay-to-win microtransaction format is off-putting. If you're comfortable with this model, then by all means, have fun. However, if you're like me and dislike pay-to-win games, it's best to avoid this one; it's not our cup of tea."
103,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"While not perfect, this game has been greatly enjoyable. The save system and possibility of sudden death can be frustrating at times. During my first playthrough, I lost my main character around the 10-hour mark of a 20-hour campaign. A reload option at that point would have been greatly appreciated. To mitigate such losses, I've resorted to using a third-party mod and save tool. Additionally, the aiming reticule is somewhat small, and the zoom feature could be more powerful. Despite these issues, the game has been a blast. As someone who isn't typically a fan of zombie games, I've found the combination of strategy, missions, and first-person shooter/beat-em-up elements to be engaging. I've been playing it as often as I can, always looking to complete just one more mission or supply run before shutting down the game."
104,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"An exceptional strategy game, in my opinion. Having played numerous other wargames, including European Escalation and ALB, I must say this one stands out. The vast array of units is impressive, with a staggering number available. The graphics are stunning, the sound effects are great, and the overall gameplay is truly epic. The in-game chat box at the main menu is surprisingly entertaining, and I'm not kidding. However, if anyone thinks this game is 'easy', or if you're new to the strategy genre, be prepared to invest time in mastering it. Do not get discouraged, as you will inevitably lose units."
105,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"I had a negative bias towards this game before playing it, and I was hesitant to buy it. The concept of the portal gun and portals seemed unusual, despite my fondness for science fiction. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The jokes and voice acting in this game are phenomenal, and the humor is well-balanced, occasionally bordering on cheesy. Each story character has a unique sense of humor and distinct personality. The level design is also impressive. Notably, I hadn't played the first Portal game before playing the sequel, but I plan to do so when I have the time."
107,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"This game is a nostalgic treat for thirty-somethings who recall watching the Transformers cartoon in the UK, if only to endure the annoying Timmy Mallet for those five minutes. The voice actors for Optimus, Megatron, Bumblebee, and others have returned, and their voices are instantly recognisable. The iconic cartoon transformation sound effect is also present. The cell-shaded graphics are perfect and quintessentially Generation One. Beyond the nostalgic value, the game is genuinely enjoyable. The combat mechanics are well-executed, with mid-fight transformations often being a necessity, seamlessly integrated into combos. Unlike High Moon's War for/Fall of Cybertron games, this title has a strong focus on melee combat, although some enemies, such as Seekers, require a switch to a ranged blaster."
108,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"I downloaded the game and played it briefly, but it didn't leave a lasting impression. However, I spent more time trying to log in than actually playing. A bug kept popping up, stating that there was an update to the terms of service. Clicking 'accept' didn't resolve the issue; I had to restart the client. Although this wasn't a major issue, I was puzzled by the requirement to link my Steam and Gface accounts. The reason cited was for DLC, but I couldn't understand why this was necessary. Furthermore, this linking process is irreversible, which means a company I'm not invested in now has access to my Steam information. The game itself is mediocre. It's easily recognizable as a Call of Duty clone, but somehow the developers managed to make the gunplay worse."

What's not to love? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nygsb617tmo This is an excellent port and a great entry point for newcomers to the series. However, be aware that there are lengthy dialogue sections, which can be skipped. While a gamepad is recommended, I found the keymouse/mouse setup to be fully functional and rebindable. The price is reasonable, and the inclusion of more than half the DLC for free is a bonus. I'd recommend this game to JRPG, anime, and visual novel fans, provided they don't mind the occasional breaks in action. Cheers.

110,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"I experienced no performance issues at release, and after numerous patches, the game runs smoothly. In my opinion, this is a great and enjoyable game, despite the somewhat frustrating format where the free-roam city area repopulates with new enemies upon progressing through the story. The 'dual play' segments, where you can play as Batman and another character, were particularly enjoyable. I also appreciated the flexibility of using a controller for most segments, while switching to mouse and keyboard for tank combat. Mastering the art of using the brakes to skid around corners while driving the Batmobile around the free-roam city, especially during APC commander chases, is quite enjoyable. Once you get the hang of it, navigating the city becomes a thrilling experience. The game's overall design allows for a seamless transition between different gameplay mechanics."
111,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"This game is a damn fine AAA FPS shooter - that's the bottom line. It boasts impressive visuals, sounds, and gameplay - great FPS mechanics, a nice story, cool characters, flawless voice acting, and a badass soundtrack. However, it's not for the faint-hearted, as some cutscenes are quite vivid and cruel. When a game is overall great, its flaws become more noticeable, and here are the ones I observed: - No SLI support, which is surprising. I had to put the game aside until I upgraded my graphics card, as it ran poorly on my old dual-GPU GTX 590. Ensure you have a fairly decent single-GPU card. - Some small obstacles are unclimbable, which seems illogical."
112,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"I am not a native English speaker, as Dutch is my native language. Please disregard any typing or grammatical errors in my review of this fantastic game. I will break down this review into several categories: graphics, controls, sound, gameplay, and replayability. 

Graphics: The game features a comic-like style, with very slick graphics that avoid unnecessary details. The color schemes are nice, and this aesthetic works well for the game. The graphics can be set to 'high' without putting excessive strain on your system. I run the game on an i5 Pentium processor, with an Nvidia GeForce 710m card and 8GB of memory, and it runs smoothly on Windows 8.1.

- controls: The game can be played with keyboard and mouse, but also with an X-box controller."
113,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"The hours I've invested in this game demonstrate my genuine enjoyment. It's everything I had hoped for in a search game from the Call of Duty series. However, I must caution against purchasing this game with the expectation that it's similar to Call of Duty, Battlefield, or other shooter games. It's a unique game that deserves to be appreciated on its own terms. I've lost count of how many times I've heard new players express frustration and complain about being killed quickly. It's almost as if they're surprised to be shot and killed, despite this being a realistic outcome. 

Edit: After playing this game for a while now and investing a significant amount of money, I can confidently say it's one of the best multiplayer games available. It's a great alternative to play when you're not in the mood for CS:GO."
114,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"I'm 2 hours in and thoroughly enjoying this game. The gameplay is solid, the art design is beautiful, and the music is surprisingly high-quality and fitting. The story and world have piqued my interest, and the puzzles are entertaining. However, the standout aspect of this game is its comedy. If you've played RPGs since their inception, you'll appreciate the various jokes, parodies, and references. Even if you're new to RPGs, the humor is still enjoyable. If you've played Final Fantasy 7 or X, you owe it to yourself to play this game. I had to pause after 2 hours to give my cheeks a break from laughing and smiling so much. What a delight so far. The comedy is so funny. Gameplay is also solid, art design is beautiful, music is surprisingly high quality and appropriate, the story/world has me interested, and the puzzles are fun."
115,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"I apologize, but despite my enthusiasm for free-to-play games and indie developers, I didn't enjoy this game. The description aligned with my interests, but the execution fell short. As a fan of puzzle and exploration games, I found this title to be unintuitive, and even after researching progression methods, the gameplay itself failed to engage me. A notable omission is a pause button, which seems crucial given the timed sequences. The game's balance also feels off, with an overemphasis on cutscenes that leave the player waiting idly. I often found myself waiting, feeling uninvolved in the experience. The lack of interactivity was disappointing."
116,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"This game is truly breathtaking. From its captivating storyline to its stunning graphics, I was completely enthralled. The narrative wasn't just a generic tale, but rather an immersive experience that made me feel like I was the protagonist, eagerly anticipating the next twist in the story. The gameplay was exceptional, and I gained valuable insights about myself, particularly my unexpected fear of heights, which was triggered by the ice caverns. My anxiety was palpable, but my determination to progress for Uncle Fred kept me going. I would be thrilled to see a DLC or sequel, and I would be the first in line to purchase it, recommending it to everyone I know. Thank you to the entire team involved in creating this masterpiece; you've truly crafted a beautiful game."
117,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth is a turn-based game where you build your civilization to achieve a specific goal or 'victory'. Unlike previous games, which followed the Earth's timeline through periods like the Stone Age, Medieval Age, and Modern Age, this game takes place in the future, where you're on a mission to colonize a new planet. I appreciate that 2K took a fresh approach to the game, introducing new mechanics such as the affinity system and orbital layer. However, these additions sometimes made the game feel overwhelming. One potential improvement could be incorporating new artwork, particularly in the environment experienced when communicating with other leaders."
118,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Great game with tons of replayability and a very fun zombie survival experience. Definitely in my top 5 zombie games ever played. After investing over 60 hours, I can confidently say this is one of the better, more realistic zombie games. Its design is reminiscent of survival horror, requiring you to conserve ammo, treat your own wounds, and take medication when infected. The zombies feel natural and are well-animated, especially considering it's a free-to-play game. I highly recommend playing with 1 or 2 friends, but the community is extremely friendly, making it easy to make friends or chat with others via voice comms."
119,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"02/07/2014 - Unfortunately, I'm unable to wholeheartedly recommend or enjoy this game due to two major issues that I've encountered during my brief playtime. I'm confident that I would be thoroughly engaged if not for these problems. Firstly, the lack of Australian servers is a significant drawback, as a single red bar results in a substantial disadvantage and unbearable lag. Notably, even the offline training mode experienced stuttering and lag, which is perplexing. The poor ping further exacerbates the issue, ultimately ruining the game. Everything is plagued by artifacts - menus, backgrounds, training, and in-game. I've never experienced this issue with my graphics card before, so I suspected it might be related to my overclock. However, resetting my GPU to its stock settings made no difference."
120,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"I completed this late last night. Although the story lacks depth and interest, the storytelling is exceptional. The atmosphere is richly detailed, and the numerous collectibles effectively flesh out the world. I gained valuable insights into the Batman universe, which made the limited number of bosses somewhat disappointing. However, future games can address this issue. The combat strikes a good balance of challenge, albeit on the easier side. Leveling up Batman was not particularly satisfying. On the other hand, upgrading and acquiring gadgets during the campaign introduced enjoyable new gameplay mechanics. Accessing previously inaccessible areas created a sense of progression."
121,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"'To the Moon' is no mere game... Nay, it is a veritable experience, and it was one of the best of my life at that. Think Telltale's 'The Walking Dead' is sad? Hohoho! Well, it's no match for 'To the Moon'! Never before have I been so deeply moved, feeling both depressed and fulfilled over something purely fictional. This masterpiece represents the pinnacle of storytelling in my opinion. The soundtrack is a gorgeously charming and perfect accompaniment. Yes, the controls are a bit finicky and the gameplay is not the strong point, but the story is so fantastic that I did not care one bit. Plus, the humor of the game is great as well and it definitely does not intrude upon the distinguished nature of the story. The Doctor Who references are endless, adding another layer of depth to the game."
122,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Bastion is a remarkably engaging game, boasting a captivating storyline. The game takes place in a post-calamity world, where you embark on rebuilding the bastion. The game offers a considerable amount of choice, allowing you to decide what to build to gain an advantage, which weapons to utilize, and what power-ups to equip them with. Additionally, you can choose from various drinks that provide bonus effects. The art style and music in the game are truly fantastic, with vibrant visuals that defy the conventional notion of a dull apocalypse. The game's narration is also noteworthy, as it dynamically responds to the player's actions."
123,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"I initially purchased this game during its early development stages, when the sole currency was spacebux and there was no 'tech tree'. This was the period when the game truly shone. At that point, all guns were equally overpowered, eliminating any balance issues; players could engage and defeat each other at will. The game also offered unlimited gun slots and five loadouts, allowing for extensive customization. Given the game's boast of having 'bajillions of guns', it's surprising that players are now limited to just six weapon slots and three loadouts, with additional slots and loadouts available only through purchase. I once had an impressive collection of guns, spanning three pages, and was brainstorming new ideas, as this aspect of the game was where I derived the most enjoyment."
124,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"This game was a surprising gem. One often encounters rave reviews of certain products that can be misleading. In this case, the reviews accurately reflect the fun of this neat little game. It's an unusual blend of a classic 2D platformer and a MOBA, executed with style. I found myself enjoying characters that I wouldn't typically enjoy in other MOBA games. I had expected this trait to continue, but decided to give a melee tank a try anyway. I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome and ended up trying out more as they were unlocked from playing games. The art style and interface are oddly charming. As such, I now use one of the characters as my avatar and a wallpaper from creating a card set for the game. I had expected this trait to continue, but decided to give a melee tank a go anyway, was changed to I had expected this trait to continue, but decided to give a melee tank a try anyway."
125,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"I recently started playing, and I'm thoroughly enjoying this game. With my headphones on, I become completely immersed in the game for hours on end. It's been a while since a game has had such a profound effect on me. The music effectively sets the mood, the sound effects are spot on, and the controls are flawless. I eagerly anticipate every combat encounter, and the developers have optimized the combat system extremely well. Initially, I had doubts about the naval combat system, but it's incredibly fun to take down multiple fleets simultaneously. The only way to lose is by failing to retreat when necessary. If the combat appears overwhelming, it's best to regroup and launch a counter-assault. Thanks to the developers for creating an awesome experience!"
126,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"The reboot of the Devil May Cry franchise has brought significant changes to the series, particularly for its protagonist, Dante. Although fans of the original series may be upset by the changes to their beloved character, they are undoubtedly for the better, as proven by this new game from Ninja Theory. DmC serves as the perfect entry point for newcomers to the series, showcasing the origins of an arrogant and cynical Dante and chronicling his transformation from cynicism to selflessness. The game weaves a clear narrative arc for the new Dante, making him a compelling character to watch. The story follows Dante as he is introduced to the corrupt world he had previously chosen to ignore, and his journey is one of growth and self-discovery."
127,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Where do I even begin with this absolutely captivating game? Its story is undeniably charming, boasting an impressive level of detail that makes it a true bundle of joy. With a perfect balance of humor and seriousness, it effortlessly navigates between heartwarming moments and laugh-out-loud humor, often courtesy of its lovable canine companions and clever secrets. The character design is impeccable, featuring a diverse cast with unique personalities and intriguing backstories. What truly sets it apart from other RPGs is its bold decision to forgo violence, a refreshing twist on the genre. Drawing inspiration from the beloved Earthbound, it's clear that this game is something special. Its soundtrack is, without a doubt, one of the best I've had the pleasure of listening to in a long time. The character design is on point, with various characters having various personalities and secrets to them. It has so much detail put into it, and it is a bundle of happiness, bad puns, annoying dogs, secrets. It is serious when it needs to be, but isn't a stranger to funny moments."
128,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"I recommend this solely because it's free and might offer a more enjoyable experience for others. However, personally, the game had little impact on me. Half of the story relies heavily on shock value, which failed to elicit an emotional response from me. I may be desensitized, or perhaps the execution was too simplistic to warrant a reaction. The other half of the game attempts to portray a person's mental decline through various themes, including obsession, hallucination, and depression. While the concept is intriguing in theory, the game's brevity and simplicity detract from its potential. I completed it in 10 minutes, taking the time to absorb every detail."
129,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Do I even need to explain why Portal is amazing? Portal is a puzzle game that introduces a concept and then steps aside, allowing you to take the reins. It's an incredible way to challenge your mind while still having fun. Although this game isn't as story-driven, it did give birth to one of the most popular games of 2011. I still play this game and beat it when I'm feeling bored, and I love to come back and see what gave birth to a legend and what is a legend. Portal's gameplay is quite simple to explain. You use portals to your advantage, along with buttons that activate a part of the puzzle. Two buttons are in the game, one that you press and one that requires a cube to be placed on it. The game's simplicity is part of its charm, making it easy to pick up and play. The portal gun is an ingenious tool that allows you to navigate through the game's challenging levels. The game's design is clever, with each level carefully crafted to test your problem-solving skills. The game's world is also rich in dark humor, with a sadistic AI that guides you through the game. Overall, Portal is a game that is both fun and challenging, making it a must-play for anyone who loves puzzle games."
130,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"If you can overlook the bugs (which I personally experienced only twice: one minor and the other quite annoying), I can definitely recommend this space exploration game. Both bugs have since been resolved, with one fix significantly increasing my FPS from 60-90 to 80-120. As most reviews focus on system specs, I'll share mine: I5 6600k (~200€), Radeon RX480 (~200€), Z170 Pro Gaming (~150€), and 16GB DDR4 RAM (~70€), totaling ~650€, which falls within the medium price range. Although my rig is relatively new, I consistently achieve 60+ FPS on high settings with VSync enabled, which makes me question the numerous comments from users with overkill setups who claim to get only 20 FPS."
131,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Remember Age of Mythology? It's been that long since an RTS game of such quality has been released. Divinity: Dragon Commander comes awfully close to becoming my personal favorite RTS game. Combining this with a huge Risk-like grand strategy mode hits the spot perfectly. I try not to be overly biased, but the fact that this game allows you to transform into a dragon, supporting, attacking, and commanding unit production, direction, and spawning simultaneously, is a significant advantage. Honestly, I do enjoy complicated RTS games, such as Civilization V. However, such games often attempt to cram complex mechanics, charts, and resources into one complicated game mode, which can be overwhelming. The ability to turn into a dragon, aiding troops, is a unique feature that sets Divinity: Dragon Commander apart."
132,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Undertale transcends the sum of its parts to create something truly remarkable. The solid retro graphics and pleasant music combine to produce breathtaking and impactful moments. The script masterfully navigates a wide range of emotions, from comedic to dramatic, heartbreaking, and hopeful, often simultaneously, while cleverly subverting RPG tropes. The world, characters, story, and gameplay are equally impressive, warranting extensive discussion. However, I'll simply say this: if you're an RPG enthusiast, play this game. If you enjoy video games, play this game. If you have seven free hours to spare, play this game, regardless of your gaming preferences."
134,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"I've only had this game for a few months, but in that short time, two DLCs have been released, along with patches that have elevated an already great game to an excellent one. The developers are very active in the community, and their engagement is evident in the discussion forums and dev diaries. Although the game's mechanics have a fairly steep learning curve, which I'm still trying to master, this complexity offers a wide range of strategies to achieve goals and capitalize on situations. The game, in my mind, is almost infinitely replayable. I find myself sucked into every session I play, regardless of how the play-through is going. The devs are very active in the community, and it really shows."
135,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Warframe is an enjoyable game for the initial few hours of play. However, after this period, the game's limitations become apparent, with repetition in combat, enemies, and gameplay being the primary concerns. A significant redeeming quality is the developers' dedication to regular updates, which often include substantial content additions, such as sweeping system changes, new warframes, and various tweaks and features. This makes Warframe suitable for casual play. Nevertheless, its ability to sustain long-term interest is questionable, unless you have a strong affinity for grinding. Fortunately, the game is free, making it worth trying out, especially if you're seeking a brief gaming experience."
136,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"This game is extremely dull. I purchased it, expecting a PC version of 'Katamari Damacy', a popular and enjoyable PS2 game. Unfortunately, it falls short. The gameplay involves absorbing increasingly larger objects to grow bigger and absorb more. However, the experience is marred by poor execution, unoriginal levels, and a surreal atmosphere that's more disturbing than entertaining. The game's depiction of 'living' creatures, from small pets to humans, is unsettling and raises questions about the creators' inspirations. I was left feeling rather depressed and questioning the value of existence. The game's overall tone is bleak and uninviting. The levels lack creativity, and the gameplay is not as smooth as it could be."
137,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"As a person deeply interested in politics, I was initially excited when I first heard about this game. I thought to myself, 'A simulator of the road to becoming president? That sounds intriguing!' Unfortunately, my enthusiasm was short-lived. The game begins by asking you to choose a side: Republican or Democrat, with no option for an independent or third-party candidate. Although slightly disappointed, I remained optimistic and continued to explore the game's features. One aspect that deserves credit is the character customization, which, despite being limited, is enjoyable to experiment with."

I enjoyed the visuals up until the last level, the ice caves, which were a notable exception. Although the story was not particularly impressive, the ending, which occurred after the closing credits, somewhat redeemed the time I spent playing the game.

However, I was disappointed with the visuals in the last level, which I found uninteresting. The gameplay also became significantly more challenging, leading to a frustrating experience of repetition until I finally succeeded. Furthermore, I found the achievements to be overly difficult, with 13 out of 15 having been achieved by less than 2.1% of players."

Cons: -bugs, particularly environmental issues, can cause players to become stuck or encounter invisible walls, even with a clear line of sight to the enemy. -The game holds the player's hand excessively, making it feel overly guided. -Enemy AI is underwhelming. -Enemies often seem to have omniscient knowledge of the player's location once spotted. -Enemies possess unreasonably high accuracy, reminiscent of the first Ghost Warrior, which can be frustrating. The remaining issues include poorly implemented checkpoints and saves, as well as an unengaging storyline that fails to capture interest. Overall, I would not recommend this game unless it's heavily discounted, even then, playing it feels like a chore, driven solely by the desire to finish and move on to the next game in my library."

144,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Hands down, my all-time favorite first-person shooter. However, this game is not suited for 'run and gun' players. The recoil and ballistics are remarkably realistic, making it a challenging experience. A single hit to the chest, neck, or head from a rifle-caliber weapon is often fatal, unless it's just a graze. Rounds drop over distance, and short, controlled bursts are necessary to maintain accuracy. There's no infinite ammunition pool; if you frequently reload mid-magazine, you'll end up with a pouch full of partially used magazines. You can't sprint indefinitely, as prolonged running will leave you gasping for breath, affecting your aim. To steady your aim, rest your weapon on your elbows while prone or on a window sill."

Instead of sensing the voltage drop caused by radiation, the proposed system measures the pulse width, i.e., the time it takes for the voltage to return to its baseline. This approach eliminates the need for power-hungry and large analog-to-digital converters. A prototype ASIC, fabricated in TSMC 65 nm LP CMOS process, consumes an average static power of 0.535 mW under a 1.2 V analog and digital power supply.

We propose a joint routing and pricing control scheme that incentivizes autonomous vehicles to seek centrally controlled system optimal routing by offering toll savings. In contrast, user equilibrium-seeking autonomous vehicles and human-driven vehicles are subject to a congestion charge. The problem is formulated as a bi-level optimization, where dynamic tolls are optimized at the upper level. The lower level is a mixed equilibrium simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment model, considering a mixed fleet of autonomous and human-driven vehicles."

However, the effectively linear interaction between motion and light or electricity restricts access to a broader class of quantum states of motion, such as cat states or energy squeezed states. Early optomechanical proposals suggested overcoming this limitation by establishing strong quadratic coupling of motion to light.

However, these evaluations can be compromised by fake reviews, also known as ""spams,"" created by professional spammers who continually adapt and refine their tactics to evade detection. The ever-evolving nature of spamming strategies makes them difficult to capture, as they can change rapidly over time, vary across spammers and target products, and often remain unknown. Most existing detectors prioritize detection accuracy, which may not be the most effective approach in maintaining trustworthy product evaluations. To address these challenges, we propose a minimax game framework where spammers and spam detectors engage in a competitive dynamic, with goals that extend beyond mere detection accuracy. The Nash equilibria of this game yield stable detectors that are resilient to diverse detection strategies."

To ensure high fidelity, we employed the Lewis-Riesenfeld method to derive a family of solutions leading to an exact transfer, where the solutions follow a single dynamical mode of the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant. Among this family, we identified a tracking solution with a single parameter to control simultaneously the fidelity of the transfer, the population of the excited state, and robustness. We define a measure of the robustness of an ultra-high fidelity transfer as the minimum percentile deviation on the pulse areas at which the infidelity rises above $10^{-4}$. The robustness of our shaped pulses is found superior to that of Gaussian and adiabatically-optimized pulses for moderate pulse areas."
203,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,paper_abstract,"In this paper, we examine the landscape of the population negative log-likelihood function of Gaussian mixture models with a variable number of components. The nonconvex nature of this function leads to the existence of multiple local minima that are not globally optimal, even in cases where the mixture components are well-separated. We demonstrate that all local minima exhibit a common structural form, which partially identifies the centers of the true mixture components. Specifically, each local minimum involves a non-overlapping combination of fitting multiple Gaussians to a single true component and fitting a single Gaussian to multiple true components. Our findings are applicable in scenarios where the true mixture components meet a specific separation condition, and remain valid regardless of whether the number of components is over- or under-specified. For Gaussian mixtures with three components, we obtain more precise results, with a clearer understanding of how the separation between components affects the outcome."

Our algorithm successfully resolves near-exact collisions, with mutual separations of a fraction of the physical radius, using the same time-step as in weakly perturbed systems like the solar system.

A widely used tool for detecting entanglement is the entanglement witness, where the measurement of the witness operator is guaranteed to be positive for all separable states and can be negative for certain entangled states. In practice, constructing an efficient entanglement witness for general multipartite entangled states is highly challenging due to the exponentially increasing Hilbert-space dimension with respect to the system size. For $n$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-like states, the most robust witness scheme requires $n+1$ local measurement settings and can tolerate up to $1/2$ white noise. In contrast, the most efficient witness for GHZ-like states only needs two local measurement settings and can tolerate up to $1/3$ white noise, demonstrating a notable difference in efficiency."

These geometries can break the axial and equatorial symmetry of the Kerr metric, exhibiting a more complex multipolar structure that offers a means of constraining fuzzball models phenomenologically. Our analysis reveals that all multipole moments are generally larger in absolute value than those of a Kerr black hole with the same mass and spin. Current measurements of the quadrupole moment of black-hole candidates impose only mild constraints on fuzzballs."

To address these limitations, we propose a model that leverages temporal point processes and variational autoencoders to infer temporal attention between nodes by observing their communication patterns. By driving between-node feature propagation through temporal attention, our approach offers greater flexibility while avoiding the drawbacks associated with human-specified edges, such as high production costs and suboptimal performance."

Consequently, the splittings imply that certain long exact homotopy group sequences decompose into short exact sequences.

By referencing a true, yet unknown, population structure, the clustering problem can be framed in a standard inferential setting. Here, ideal population clustering is defined as the partition induced by the true density function. The nonparametric formulation, known as modal clustering, establishes a correspondence between groups and the domains of attraction of density modes. To implement this approach, a nonparametric density estimate is necessary, and proper selection of the smoothing amount is crucial in shaping the density and identifying the final partition. The amount of smoothing governs the density's shape and possibly its modal structure. In this work, we address the issue of density estimation for modal clustering from an asymptotic perspective."

However, helicity selection rules for diboson scattering amplitudes pose an obstruction to the naive interference contributions of dimension-six operators, causing the leading contribution to the total diboson rate correction to cancel. Careful measurement of the azimuthal decay angles can ""resurrect"" the interference, recouping sensitivity to the ""non-interfering"" operators. We explore these signatures in detail and find that the EFT uncertainties associated with higher-dimensional operators are uniquely well-suppressed by constructing an asymmetry variable generated solely by these non-interfering operators, relegating the effects of higher-dimensional, interfering operators to the same status as statistical errors in this observable."

We categorize the scientific contributions of data science into three task classes: description, prediction, and counterfactual prediction, which encompasses causal inference. A clear classification of data science tasks is essential for discussing the data, assumptions, and analytics required for each task.

This note demonstrates that, for a generic Einstein quantum theory of gravity in AdS, exact stability of extremal black branes conflicts with rigorously proven quantum information theorems regarding entanglement entropy. Resolving this contradiction yields a nonperturbative version of the WGC, which aligns with the standard statement at weak coupling.

Ultracold 2D Fermi gases have emerged as ideal model systems to study the interplay between strong correlations and reduced dimensionality. However, direct evidence of superfluidity in these systems has been lacking. We demonstrate superfluidity in an ultracold 2D Fermi gas by moving a periodic potential through the system and observing no dissipation below a critical velocity v$_{\rm c}$. Our measurement of v$_{\rm c}$ as a function of interaction strength reveals a maximum in the crossover regime between bosonic and fermionic superfluidity.

Importantly, it provides a method for grading the voltage drop across high voltage insulators, thereby increasing the maximum operational voltage that can be applied across the insulator without surface flashover. However, a concern for the use of this method is the long-term stability of the implantation-induced conductivity, particularly if the implanted metal species is readily oxidized. Here we report on our examination of the long-term behavior of the surface conductivity of titanium-implanted alumina.

In this context, vector mesons assume the role of Chern-Simons vector fields residing on the quantum Hall droplet that constitutes the n_f=1 baryon. We propose that this current provides the correct effective expression for the baryon current at low energies. This proposal offers a unified picture for the two types of baryons, enabling their continuous transformation into one another in a natural manner.

By generalizing the Furusaki-Tsukada formula, initially established to quantify conventional Josephson current flows, we assess the transverse current components and show that their amplitudes can be extensively tuned via the spin-orbit coupling strengths or the superconducting phase difference across the junction."

Vortices separate into two distinct families: small, fast-moving cores and larger, slowly moving ones that can be described as 'frozen' into a slowly evolving 'crystal'. The kinematics of both families are very different, and only the former is self-similar.

However, a corpus often contains thousands of similar inputs, resulting in a lack of diversity that can lead to inefficient fuzzing efforts due to exhaustive mutation from all available seeds. To mitigate this issue, fuzzers are equipped with distillation tools, such as afl-cmin, which select the smallest subset of seeds that trigger the same range of instrumentation data points as the full corpus. Minimizing the number and cumulative size of seeds is believed to lead to more efficient fuzzing. We systematically investigate this notion and present the results of over 34 cpu-years of fuzzing using five distillation approaches to understand their impact on bug detection in real-world software."

Direpack is designed to be consistent with the scikit-learn API, allowing estimators to seamlessly integrate into statistical and machine learning pipelines within that framework."
233,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,paper_abstract,"The nonlinear fluorescence emission has been widely applied for high spatial resolution optical imaging. Here, we investigated the anomalous saturating effect of nitrogen vacancy defects in diamond. High-power laser excitation led to fluorescence reduction, increasing the nonlinearity of fluorescence emission and altering the spatial frequency distribution of the fluorescence image. A differential excitation protocol was employed to extract high spatial frequency information. By modulating the excitation laser's power, the spatial resolution of imaging was improved approximately 1.6 times compared to confocal microscopy. Due to the simplicity of the experimental setup and data processing, we expect this method can be used for improving the spatial resolution of sensing and biological labeling with defects in solids. The fluorescence reduction was observed with high power laser excitation. It increased the nonlinearity of the fluorescence emission, and changed the spatial frequency distribution of the fluorescence image."
234,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,paper_abstract,"When random effects are correlated with sample design variables, the conventional approach of using individual survey weights, constructed to be inversely proportional to the unit survey inclusion probabilities, to form a pseudo-likelihood no longer yields asymptotically unbiased inference. We develop a weight-exponentiated formulation for the random effects distribution, which achieves unbiased inference for generating hyperparameters of the random effects. In contrast to frequentist methods that rely on numerical integration, our approach uniquely achieves both unbiased estimation with respect to the sampling design distribution and consistency with respect to the population generating distribution. Our simulations and real data example for a survey of business establishments demonstrate the utility of our approach across different modeling formulations and sampling designs. This work serves as a capstone for recent developmental efforts that combine traditional survey estimation approaches with the bayesian modeling paradigm and provides a bridge across the two rich but disparate sub-fields."
235,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,paper_abstract,"Low-symmetry 2D materials, including res$_2$ and rese$_2$ monolayers, black phosphorus monolayers, group-IV monochalcogenide monolayers, and borophene, exhibit more complex atomistic structures compared to the honeycomb lattices of graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, and transition metal dichalcogenides. Their reduced symmetries lead to inhomogeneous electron, optical, valley, and spin responses, as well as novel properties like ferroelasticity, ferroelectricity, and magnetism. Additionally, these materials display spin-wave phenomena, large nonlinear optical properties, photogalvanic effects, and superconductivity. The special topic ""Beyond Graphene: Low-Symmetry and Anisotropic 2D Materials"" showcases recent experimental and theoretical research on these emerging materials, highlighting their unique electronic topological properties, nonlinear elastic properties, and structural phase transformations."
236,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,paper_abstract,"Orientational dynamics in the isotropic phase of a comb-shaped nematic polymer with mesogenic and functional side groups were investigated using the Kerr effect and dielectric spectroscopy. Notably, it was discovered that the relaxation of electric birefringence in a mesogenic polymer melt above the nematic-isotropic phase transition temperature can be described by a sum of several exponential processes, with two dominant processes playing a crucial role. These primary processes replace each other within a temperature range of approximately fifty degrees. Dielectric spectroscopy also revealed two distinct orientational relaxation processes: one attributed to the rotation of side mesogenic groups, and the other associated with the motion of main chain segments, providing a more detailed understanding of the polymer's behavior."
237,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,paper_abstract,"Deep hashing methods have demonstrated exceptional retrieval accuracy and efficiency in large-scale image retrieval. Optimizing discrete hash bits remains a key focus in these methods. A common approach involves employing an activation function, such as sigmoid or tanh, and minimizing a quantization loss to approximate discrete values. However, this paradigm can lead to an increasing number of hash bits becoming stuck in the wrong saturated area of the activation functions, from which they never escape. We refer to this issue as the ""dead bits problem"" (dbp). Furthermore, existing quantization losses can exacerbate dbp. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective gradient amplifier that precedes activation functions to mitigate dbp."
238,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,paper_abstract,"We investigate the phenomenology of a hypercharge-zero SU(2) triplet scalar, motivated by two-step electroweak symmetry-breaking. We consider two scenarios: the triplets are stable and contribute to the dark matter density, or they decay via mixing with the standard model Higgs boson. The stable triplet scenario is constrained by LHC disappearing charged track searches and dark matter direct detection experiments. The unstable triplet scenario is constrained by existing multilepton collider searches. Our findings indicate that a two-step electroweak phase transition involving a stable triplet with a negative quadratic term is ruled out by direct detection searches. In contrast, an unstable triplet with a mass below 230 GeV is excluded at a 95% confidence level."
239,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,paper_abstract,"This paper demonstrates that the eccentric debris rings surrounding the stars Fomalhaut and HD 202628 are narrower than anticipated in the standard eccentric planet perturbation scenario, also known as ""pericenter glow."" The standard scenario assumes an initially circular and narrow belt of planetesimals at semi-major axis $a$, whose eccentricity is increased to $e_f$ after the gas disc has dispersed due to secular perturbations from an eccentric planet, resulting in a belt of width $2ae_f$. A minor modification to this scenario suggests that narrower belts can form if the planetesimals are initially eccentric, potentially resulting from earlier planet perturbations during the gas-rich protoplanetary disc phase. However, a primordial eccentricity could also be caused by instabilities that increase the disc eccentricity, without the need for any planets."
240,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,paper_abstract,"An electron is typically considered to possess only one type of kinetic energy, but could it have more, due to its spin and charge, or by exciting other electrons? In one dimension (1D), the physics of interacting electrons is well-captured at low energies by the Tomonaga-Luttinger-Liquid (TLL) model, yet little has been observed experimentally beyond this linear regime. Here, we report on measurements of many-body modes in 1D gated-wires using a tunnelling spectroscopy technique. We observe two separate Fermi seas at high energies, associated with spin and charge excitations. Furthermore, three additional 1D 'replica' modes emerge, strengthening with decreasing wire length. The effective interaction strength in the wires is varied by changing the amount of 1D inter-subband screening, which is adjusted by over 45%."

The globular cluster system of our galaxy likely followed a similarly intricate formation path. To constrain this path, we investigate the link between globular clusters and known merging events experienced by the Milky Way. We combined Gaia's kinematic information for nearly all galactic clusters with the largest sample of cluster ages, carefully correcting for systematic errors. To identify clusters with a common origin, we analyzed their dynamical properties, particularly in the space of integrals of motion. We find that about 40% of the clusters likely formed in situ."
242,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,paper_abstract,"The estimation of a dataset's intrinsic dimension is a crucial step in most dimensionality reduction techniques. This article introduces intrinsic, an R package that implements state-of-the-art likelihood-based estimators of a dataset's intrinsic dimension. The package includes the two-nn, gride, and hidalgo models. To facilitate easy access to these novel estimators, the package provides high-level, intuitive functions built on a set of efficient, low-level routines. Intrinsic encompasses models in two categories: homogeneous and heterogeneous intrinsic dimension estimators. The homogeneous category comprises the two-nn and gride models, with functions that perform inference under both frequentist and Bayesian frameworks. The heterogeneous category includes hidalgo, a Bayesian mixture model, for which an efficient Gibbs sampler is implemented. The package contains a few high-level, intuitive functions that rely on a broader set of efficient, low-level routines. Intrinsic dimension estimators are categorized into two categories."

Two physical RC systems were proposed and modeled: one based on a single magnetic skyrmion memristor (MSM) and the other on 24 spin-torque nano-oscillators (STNOs), to process image classification tasks and nonlinear dynamic system predictions, respectively. Our micromagnetic simulation results on the nonlinear responses of MSM and STNO to current pulse stimulation revealed that an RC system utilizing a single MSM achieved outstanding performance in handwritten digits recognition. Furthermore, a physical RC system comprising 24 STNOs effectively solved complex unknown nonlinear dynamic problems, as confirmed in a second-order nonlinear dynamic system and NARMA10 tasks."
244,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,paper_abstract,"Ranking algorithms are pivotal in online platforms, including search engines and recommender systems. This paper reveals a surprising consequence of popularity-based rankings: when fewer items report a given signal, they collectively attract a higher share of overall traffic. The few-get-richer effect arises in settings with few distinct item classes, such as left-leaning versus right-leaning news sources, where items are ranked by popularity. Analytically, we demonstrate that this effect emerges when users tend to click on top-ranked items and exhibit heterogeneous preferences for item classes. Through simulations, we examine how the effect's strength varies with setting and human behavior assumptions. We experimentally test our predictions in an online study with human participants. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the spread of misinformation. The few-get-richer effect emerges when people tend to click on top-ranked items and have heterogeneous preferences for the classes of items."
245,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,paper_abstract,"Weight pruning is widely recognized as a straightforward and effective method for eliminating redundancy in deep neural networks (DNNs), resulting in accelerated performance across various platforms. However, most pruning techniques involve trade-offs between model accuracy and regularity, leading to impaired inference accuracy and limited on-device acceleration performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel sparsity dimension, pattern-based sparsity, which combines pattern and connectivity sparsity to achieve both high accuracy and hardware friendliness. By carefully designing patterns, our pruning approach consistently achieves accuracy enhancement and improved feature extraction capabilities across different DNN structures and datasets. Our pattern-aware pruning framework simultaneously performs pattern library extraction, pattern selection, pattern and connectivity pruning, and weight training. The new pattern-based sparsity naturally lends itself to compiler optimization, enabling highly efficient DNN execution on mobile platforms."
246,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,paper_abstract,"Difference-in-differences analysis with a control group that significantly differs from a treated group is susceptible to bias from historical events that have disparate effects on the groups. To mitigate this, constructing a more closely matched control group by matching a subset of the overall control group to the treated group can result in reduced bias. We investigate this phenomenon through simulation studies. We examine the impact of mountaintop removal mining (mrm) on mortality using a difference-in-differences analysis that leverages the increase in mrm following the 1990 clean air act amendments. By constructing a more closely matched control group for a difference-in-differences analysis of the effect of mrm on mortality, we found a 95% confidence interval that encompasses substantial adverse effects, no effect, and small beneficial effects."
247,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,paper_abstract,"When constructing models to summarize clinical data for simulation purposes, it is essential to assess their ability to accurately reproduce the data. This evaluation can be performed using visual predictive checks (VPCs), which involve (1) simulating the original study multiple times from the model being evaluated, (2) calculating estimates of interest for each simulated study, and (3) comparing the distribution of these estimates with the original study's estimate. This procedure is a widely applicable, straightforward method. In this context, we explore its application to time-to-event data, focusing on the specific scenario where a time-varying covariate is unknown or cannot be approximated after the event time."

(ii) analytical prediction of the probability of transferring a quantum system into a target state via stochastic sequential measurements. (iii) optimal reconstruction of environmental noise sources' spectral density by orthogonalizing filter functions in the frequency domain, driving the designed quantum sensor.

Can we build back better from this? I believe that before we can even begin to answer that question, we must first strive to comprehend the magnitude of this moment."
280,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"In 1903, the President of the United States embarked on a three-day camping trip in California's Yosemite Valley. President Theodore Roosevelt spent his nights in a grove of towering sequoia trees, braved a snowstorm, and engaged in hours of conversation around the campfire with his host and guide, renowned conservationist John Muir. Although Roosevelt was well-known for his love of the outdoors, Muir's invitation extended beyond a mere camping excursion: Yosemite was facing a grave threat. Despite being designated as protected land in 1864, the valley remained vulnerable to overdevelopment in 1903. This predicament was at the heart of a decades-long struggle to balance preservation and public use – a delicate balance that proved far easier to conceptualize than achieve."

(applause) My lifelong ambition has been to become a pilot, to soar through the skies and experience the thrill of freedom. Unfortunately, that dream remains elusive, as I reside in Gaza, where there is no airport and all borders are sealed. We are essentially confined to one of the world's largest prisons. My only solace is gazing up at the sky. On some days, we're fortunate to have electricity for four or five hours. When it's cold, we make a fire on the front or on the roof of our homes."
282,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"I apologize for not being able to reveal my face, as doing so would put me in danger from those who wish to harm me. My journey began 14 years ago when I was a young reporter, fresh out of college. I stumbled upon a scoop that, although straightforward, had significant implications. It involved police officers accepting bribes from street vendors. As a novice journalist, I sought to approach the story in a unique way to maximize its impact, given that the issue was well-known yet remained unchecked. I decided to go undercover, posing as a vendor, and in doing so, I was able to gather concrete evidence. The impact was substantial. It was fantastic. This style of reporting is often referred to as immersion or undercover journalism. I was a young reporter. I had just come out of college.then i got a scoop. The scoop was quite a very simple story. Police officers were taking bribes from hawkers who were hawking on the streets. As a young reporter, i thought that i should do it in a different way, so that it has a maximum impact, since everybody knew that it was happening, and yet there was nothing that was keeping it out of the system.so i decided to go there and act as a seller. As part of selling, i was able to document the hard core evidence."
283,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"One simple vitamin can reduce your risk of heart disease. Eating chocolate reduces stress in students. A new drug prolongs lives of patients with rare diseases. Health headlines like these are published daily, often making contradictory claims. There can be a disconnect between broad, attention-grabbing headlines and the specific, incremental results of the medical research they cover. To avoid being misled, it's essential to assess a headline's credibility by examining the original research it reports on. We've created hypothetical research scenarios for each of these three headlines. Keep watching for the explanation of the first example, then pause at the headline to answer the question. These scenarios are simplified for clarity."
284,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"When I was 14, my family was in the process of adopting my little brothers from Ethiopia. My mom asked, ""What date should we put for their birthday?"" I thought it was a ridiculous question, responding, ""The day they were born, obviously?"" However, my mom explained that neither of my brothers had a birth certificate, making it impossible to determine their exact birthdate. This revelation had a profound impact on me. Twenty years later, I'm still working on this issue, but now I'm trying to solve it on a global scale. So, what's the connection between birth certificates and international development?"
285,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"Imagine being able to plug your brain into a machine that would provide you with ultimate pleasure for the rest of your life. If given the choice, would you opt for such an existence? This is the question philosopher Robert Nozick posed through his thought-provoking experiment, the Experience Machine. The experiment invites us to consider a world where scientists have developed a machine that simulates real life, guaranteeing experiences of only pleasure and no pain. The catch is that you must permanently leave reality behind, but the difference would be almost imperceptible. Your experiences would be indistinguishable from reality. Life's natural fluctuations would be replaced with an endless series of positive experiences. Sounds great, right?"
286,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"I'd like to share with you the most embarrassing experience I've had during my years as a palliative care physician. This incident occurred a couple of years ago. I was consulted to see a woman in her 70s, a retired English professor, who was battling pancreatic cancer. She was experiencing pain, nausea, and vomiting, prompting the request for my expertise. During our consultation, we discussed her symptoms, and she inquired about the potential benefits of medical marijuana. I reflected on my medical school education, only to realize that I had received no formal training on the subject of medical marijuana."
287,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"For the past 24 years, I have served as a firefighter in Huntington, West Virginia. As firefighters, my team and I are responsible for saving lives and property from disasters such as car wrecks, house fires, and life-threatening medical emergencies. I am a woman leading a department in a male-dominated profession. Ten years ago, I decided to expand my medical knowledge and pursued a nursing degree. This decision was driven by the realization that the next significant threat facing not only my city, but also cities nationwide, was not the one-and-done disaster, where you can ride in like the cavalry, as a firefighter, put out the fire and leave, feeling like you have made a difference and everything is ok."
288,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"Where does all the released carbon go? Carbon operates within a natural cycle, present in all living organisms: in the soil, oceans, atmosphere, and deep underground rocks. When plants and other living organisms die, a significant portion of their stored carbon returns to the atmosphere until new plants grow and reabsorb it. However, over millions of years, some of the carbon stored in ancient trees and sea life transforms into rock and fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas. Natural events, like volcanic eruptions, release some of the carbon trapped in rock. Human activities, including the burning of fossil fuels, also release prehistoric carbon. Today, humans release approximately 60 times more carbon than all the volcanoes on the planet each year, while the natural cycle of carbon continues with plants and other living things dying, and new ones growing and reabsorbing the carbon."
289,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"Even nature's most unappealing creatures hold significant secrets, but who would want a swarm of cockroaches approaching them? One of the greatest differences between natural and human technologies lies in robustness. Robust systems remain stable in complex and unfamiliar environments. Notably, cockroaches can self-stabilize while running over rough terrain. When we equipped them with a jet pack or subjected them to a perturbation like an earthquake, we found that their remarkably tuned legs allowed them to self-stabilize without relying on brainpower. They can navigate complex terrain, such as grass, with ease and without destabilizing. We discovered a new behavior where, due to their shape, they automatically roll onto their side to pass through a test section of artificial grass. Robust systems can perform multiple tasks with the same structure. Here's a new behavior we've discovered."
290,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"These are indeed grim economic times, fellow tedsters. To lift your spirits, I'd like to share a remarkable, albeit lesser-known, commercial success story from the past 20 years. Comparable in its own unique way to the achievements of Microsoft or Google, this industry has defied the current recession with remarkable resilience. I'm referring to organized crime. While it's true that organized crime has a long history, its expansion over the last two decades has been unprecedented, now accounting for roughly 15 percent of the world's GDP. I call it the global shadow economy, or Mcmafia for short. What triggered this extraordinary growth in cross-border crime? Organized crime has been around for a very long time, and these would be wise words, indeed. But in the last two decades, it has experienced an unprecedented expansion."
292,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"What is a parent? It's not an easy question. Today we have adoption, stepfamilies, and surrogate mothers. Many parents face tough questions and tough decisions. Shall we tell our child about the sperm donation? If so, when? What words to use? Sperm donors are often referred to as ""biological fathers,"" but should we really be using the word ""father?"" As a philosopher and social scientist, I have been studying these questions about the concept of parenthood. But today, I will talk to you about what I learned from talking to parents and children. They know what matters most in a family, even though their family looks a little different."
293,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"When I look in the mirror today, I see a multifaceted individual: a justice and education scholar at Columbia University, a dedicated youth mentor, a passionate activist, and a future New York State Senator. (cheering) I see all of that and a man who spent a quarter of his life in state prison — six years, to be exact, starting as a teenager on Rikers Island for an act that nearly cost a man his life. But what got me from there to here wasn't the punishment I faced as a teenager in adult prison or the harshness of our legal system. Instead, it was a transformative learning environment of a classroom that introduced me to something I didn't think was possible for me or our justice system as a whole. A few weeks before my release on parole, a counselor encouraged me to enroll in a new college course being offered in the prison."
294,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"When you look at me, what comes to mind? Do you see a woman of faith, an expert, or perhaps a sister? Or do you perceive me as oppressed, brainwashed, or a terrorist? Maybe I'm just a delay in the airport security line – and that one actually happens to be true. (laughter) If some of your perceptions were negative, I don't hold it against you. The media often portrays people who look like me in a negative light. In fact, one study found that 80 percent of news coverage about Islam and Muslims is negative. Many Americans admit they don't know a Muslim. I suppose that's because people don't often talk to their Uber drivers. (laughter) For those of you who have never met a Muslim, it's great to meet you."
295,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"We need to establish a comprehensive weather service for water. However, until we collectively demand accountability, the incentives to fund it will not exist. The first time I spoke at a conference was here at TED, eight years ago. Fresh out of graduate school, I had no idea that my brief time onstage would frame the questions I would be asked for the next decade. Like many 20-somethings, I was optimistic that I could solve the world's problems, particularly those related to water, with my technology. I had a lot to learn. It was a seductive idea to believe that our biggest water quality problems persist due to their complexity. I presumed that we just needed simpler, faster, and more affordable sensors to identify these issues. I was wrong. Yet, until we collectively demand accountability, the incentives to fund it will not exist. I had a lot to learn. I was wrong."
296,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"Indeed, for 20 years, I worked in finance and was confident in my knowledge of the field. I had a deep understanding of the global economy, as it was my area of expertise. I was familiar with various topics, including ecology and the potential end of the world, but I didn't truly believe in their significance. The 2007 subprime crisis, which led to the collapse of major American banks, was a pivotal moment that shook me. I recall having intense discussions with my wife about the crisis, my job, and the limitations of our financial models. The crisis made me realize that I had been mistaken, and that we were, in fact, heading for disaster."
300,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"Someone once said that politics is, of course, ""showbiz for ugly people."" On that basis, I feel like I've truly arrived. As a politician, it's an honor to give a TED Talk, particularly in the U.K., where the reputation of politics has sunk so low due to the expenses scandal. There was a recent story that scientists considered replacing rats in experiments with politicians. When asked why, they replied, ""There's no shortage of politicians, no one really minds what happens to them, and there are some things rats just won't do."" (laughter) Now, I know you all appreciate data, so I'll begin with a data-rich slide."
