The first, 'Blow Out,' is a gloriously over-the-top concept that defies expectations with its lack of gay characters. Hairstylist Jonathan Antin dreams of expanding his popular West Hollywood salon to Beverly Hills, but his enthusiasm is both infectious and cringe-worthy. As I flipped through channels, I caught a glimpse of Jonathan, equally narcissistic and dull, surveying an empty space on Rodeo Drive. His voice, dripping with self-importance, declared, 'This will be the greatest salon in history!' and I was hooked. Not since 'Rocco' have I found such a trainwreck compelling viewing."

I also learned how remarkably sweet total strangers can be for no reason other than to be kind. Trust me, it wasn't like they were trying to get into my pants or anything. I had kid drool all over me and was wearing my 'wash-day' outfit... Also, I'm not sure I'll ever be bathing again, so it's not like there was even an olfactory incentive there!

I didn't even swear, which is unusual for me. I just morosely ripped it out and listened to Season 2 of Sex and the City (way to go, library!). And then I got sick of it and threw it away. I suppose I learned a lot while trying to make this sweater."

I devoured three books - Bruce Sterling's 'Heavy Weather,' Larry Niven's 'World of Ptavvs,' and Octavia Butler's 'Parable of the Sower.' While 'Heavy Weather' was a gripping cyberpunk tale of a near-future US, ravaged by global warming and chaos, I didn't find it particularly memorable. The characters and story were well-crafted, but I didn't experience any profound emotions. Still, it was an enjoyable read."

Post-practicum trauma was a hidden epidemic that is now coming to light. I was initially struck by the weight of the burden I carried after the experience, but the meeting with the course coordinator allowed me to finally release my burden and prevent another student from suffering the same fate. Yesterday, I encountered a fellow classmate who was determined to share her own story of trauma and frustration with the practicum experience.

I put down my book and went to open the door, but no one was there. Great. I returned to my studies and, just as I was finding a little glimmer of understanding buried in my subconscious, the doorbell rang again. Bam, just like that, my breakthrough disappeared. I went to the door and, once again, no one was there. Just what a struggling math student needs, an uninvited practical joker."

From August 2000 to September 2000, the rate schedule yields a larger commodity charge due to SD&E customers receiving a lump sum reimbursement from SD&E over those two months. As a result, SD&E customers will experience lower electric bills. Assuming the lump sum reimbursement is not included in the implicit energy component, the average for June 2000 through January 2001 is 6.2 cents, and the implicit commodity average from February 2001 through December 2001 is 7.3 cents. The average implicit commodity from June 2000 through December 2001 is 6.9 cents for deliveries starting September 1, 2000, the average would still be 6.9 cents."

At its core, Magic the Gathering is meant to be enjoyed with friends, not a lonely grind against the computer or random opponents. The lack of social interaction is a major drawback, especially when it comes to earning gold, which is essential for unlocking cards. The daily cap on gold earnings is understandable, but it's frustrating to have to grind for hours on end to unlock content that should be accessible from the start. Even playing for free will take a significant amount of time, with little to no social interaction."

I quite hate pre-quals as they technically go backwards in a story and not forwards. Granted, they offer more storywise. The combat feels sloppy and doesn't feel as sharp as Arkham City managed to make it. As of writing this recommendation (26/10/2013), there is a game-breaking bug that stops a side mission from ever being completed (main story not affected). Some gadgets are placed at an absurdly hotkey that makes your hand have to travel the whole keyboard to get to it. It might sound like nothing, but while in combat, it could potentially break your combo."

Why can't someone with 1.74m become as skilled in shooting as someone with 1.71m? I'm 1.87m in real life and noticed that I couldn't reach a higher skill level than 89. It's a pure discrimination!

The gunplay was passable, but the fact that it's a pay-to-win title is a major turn-off for me. As someone who values fairness and equality in gaming, I find it unacceptable to require players to spend money to have a competitive advantage. If you're willing to overlook this aspect, then by all means, give it a try. However, as for me, I'll have to pass. The hardsuit is enjoyable to use, and the HRV is a great concept, but the game's business model doesn't align with my values."

The save system and possibility of sudden death can be frustrating, but I've found a third-party mod/save tool to mitigate these issues. The aiming reticule is small, and the zoom could be more powerful, but overall, I'm enjoying the combination of strategy, missions, and first-person shooter/beat 'em up gameplay. I've been playing it frequently, often finding myself saying, 'Just one more mission, just one more supply run...' before shutting it down."

It's always more fun to play with someone else, as you can work together to take down the evil villains and save the city.
 The ability to use the controller for the tank combat segments is also a nice touch, as it allows for more precise control over your tank's movements and weapons. And I'm glad you found the driving sections enjoyable! It can be tricky to get the hang of driving a tank, but once you get the hang of it, it's actually quite satisfying to smash through obstacles and take down enemies.

Can't tell you how many times I've heard new players ♥♥♥♥ and complain about getting killed really fast. Oh god forbid you get shot in the face and ♥♥♥♥ing die. It's not like that doesn't happen in real life or anything. Edit: okay, so I've been playing this game for a while now. Thrown all kinds of money at it. One of the best MP games around.

If you've played any RPG since the dawn of video game RPGs, you'll find yourself laughing at the various jokes, parodies, and references. Even if you've never played an RPG before, you'll still enjoy the game's humor. I had to stop playing after two hours to give my cheeks a break from laughing and smiling so much. It's a delight so far."

The gameplay was unintuitive and I struggled to find enjoyment in it, even after looking up how to progress. Additionally, the lack of a pause button was frustrating, especially given that many sequences are timed. I felt like the game was more cutscene than game, and I found myself sitting around tapping my fingers impatiently. Overall, I don't think this game is worth playing."

Firstly, the lack of Australian servers puts me at a severe disadvantage, with unbearable lag. Even playing through offline training mode resulted in stuttering and lag, a peculiar occurrence given my system's specifications. Combined with the poor ping, it significantly hinders the gaming experience. Secondly, the game's graphics and menus artifact excessively, including backgrounds, training, and in-game elements.

The game's collectibles and gadgets add a nice layer of variety to the gameplay, and the leveling system is well-balanced. However, I was disappointed that there were not more boss battles in the game. While the combat is engaging, it's on the easier side, and the leveling system is satisfying, but it's not as satisfying as I had hoped. Nonetheless, I learned a lot about the Batman universe, and I'm excited to see what future games in the series will offer."

It's surprising that a game with 'bajillions of guns' doesn't offer more than six weapon slots and three loadouts, especially when it comes to new players. At one point, I had about three pages worth of guns and was planning on coming up with new ideas for more, as I found it enjoyable to have a variety of options."

It's been a while since a game has had such an impact on me. The music sets the tone, the sound effects are spot on, and the controls are flawless. I eagerly anticipate each combat encounter and they've optimized combat to perfection. I was initially skeptical about the naval combat system, but it's incredibly enjoyable to lay waste to multiple fleets at once! The only way to lose in this game is to fail to retreat. If the combat appears overwhelming, just retreat, regroup, and counter-attack. Thank you, developers, for an exceptional experience!"
127,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Where do I start with this incredible game? Its story is absolutely captivating, with a charm that's hard to put into words. The attention to detail is impressive, with a wealth of depth and nuance in every aspect of the game. From the quirky characters to the intricate secrets, it's a true masterclass in storytelling. The game's ability to balance serious moments with lighthearted humor is particularly noteworthy, making it a joy to play. The character designs are also top-notch, with each character having their own unique personality and secrets. What sets it apart from other RPGs is its refreshing lack of violence, making it a breath of fresh air in a genre that often relies on killing and combat. With inspiration from Earthbound, one of the best RPGs I've ever played, it's clear that this game is going to be something special. The soundtrack is equally impressive, with a haunting and memorable score that complements the game's atmosphere perfectly."

So, the game is free to play and the developers are actively working on it, releasing new content and updates regularly to keep the game fresh and interesting. However, the game may not hold your attention for a long time due to the repetitive nature of the gameplay, and it's not something you'll likely come back to play after a few months. But hey, it's free, so it's worth checking out if you're looking for a quick gaming fix."
136,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"I can understand why you might find the game unsettling or unpleasant, as it does have some dark and unsettling elements. However, I don't think it's fair to say that it's a ""surreal horror show."" While it does have some elements of horror, it's also a commentary on the monotony and banality of modern life. The game's creators are using the horror genre as a way to poke fun at the mundanity of everyday life and to comment on the absurdity of some of the things we do.
The game's use of bright, garish colors and exaggerated character designs also serves to contrast with the darker themes and to make them more palatable.
Overall, I think the game is more of a social commentary than a horror game, and it's meant to be more of a satirical look at modern life than an actual horror experience.""
So, while it may not be the most enjoyable game for everyone, I think it's important to appreciate the game's unique take on the horror genre and the commentary it provides on modern life."

It's great that you're enjoying the character customization and the ability to wear your head or not in a campaign. It's important to remember that games are meant to be fun and entertaining, and it's okay if it's not always realistic or representative of real-world politics. It's okay to have fun and enjoy the game without feeling like you're being forced to choose a particular political side. Just be yourself and have fun with it!"

On the one hand, I found the visuals to be impressive until the final level, where they became less interesting. The story was decent, but it wasn't anything special. What I didn't enjoy was the gameplay in the final level, as it became quite frustrating having to repeat the same actions over and over again to progress.

However, the effectively linear interaction between motion and light or electricity prevents access to a broader class of quantum states of motion, such as cat states or energy-squeezed states.
Early optomechanical proposals suggested the possibility of escaping this restriction by creating strong quadratic coupling of motion to light. While there have been experimental demonstrations of quadratically coupled optomechanical systems, these have not yet accessed non-classical states of motion."

Our results apply to the scenario where the true mixture components satisfy a certain separation condition, and are valid even when the number of components is over- or under-specified. For Gaussian mixtures with three components, we obtain sharper results in terms of the scaling with the separation between the components."

The authors propose a nonparametric density-based method, called modal clustering, which is motivated by the fact that the true density function is generally unknown and may have a complex structure.

The authors argue that the traditional parametric approach to clustering, which assumes a fixed density function, is not well-suited for dealing with the complexity of real-world data. Instead, they propose a nonparametric approach that models the density function as a function of the data distribution, allowing the algorithm to adapt to the underlying structure of the data.
The authors define the ideal population clustering problem as the partition of the data into groups such that the density of each group is as close as possible to the true density of the population. They argue that this problem is a fundamental problem in clustering, as it is the only way to ensure that the clusters are formed based on the underlying structure"

In this case, measuring the azimuthal decay angles ""resurrects"" the interference, recouping sensitivity to the ""non-interfering"" operators. We explore these signatures in detail, and find that the EFT uncertainties associated with higher-dimensional operators are uniquely well-suppressed by the construction of an asymmetry variable that is only generated by these non-interfering operators, relegating the effects of higher-dimensional, interfering operators to the same status as statistical errors in this observable."

We consider the case where the WSM regions are separated by a junction, and the junction direction is tilted with respect to the plane of the WSM regions. We study the differential conductance and pairing amplitudes of the junction as a function of the junction direction and the chirality imbalance between the WSM regions.

We find that the differential conductance and pairing amplitudes strongly depend on the angle between the junction direction in real space and the axis separating the WSM nodes in momentum space. We identify the influence of a chiral chemical potential, i.e., the electron population imbalance between WSM nodes of opposite chirality, on the transport characteristics of the junction. Remarkably, we observe a net spin polarization of cooper pairs that are generated via Andreev reflection in the two WSM regions. The spin polarization is opposite in the two WSM regions and highly sensitive to the chirality imbalance and excitation energy.

Existing approaches to user cold-start recommendation either require additional user effort, such as conducting an interview, or utilize side information, such as user demographics or social connections. However, users may not be willing to provide additional information, and side information is often not available for cold-start users."
228,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,paper_abstract,"Deep learning has surpassed heuristic algorithms in solving complex problems. Its application in wireless communications has also shown promising results, despite the well-established optimal algorithms for various tasks. While some gains have been achieved by learning individual parts of a receiver, a more effective approach is to jointly learn the entire receiver. However, this often translates to a challenging nonlinear problem, making it difficult to implement the optimal solution. To address this, we propose a deep fully convolutional neural network, Deeprx, that seamlessly integrates the entire receiver pipeline from frequency domain signal stream to uncoded bits in a 5G-compliant manner. By carefully constructing the input of the convolutional neural network using both data and pilot symbols, we facilitate accurate channel estimation."

A corpus of potential seeds may contain thousands of similar inputs, leading to wasted effort. To address this, fuzzers use distillation tools (e.g., afl-cmin) to select the smallest subset of seeds that triggers the same range of instrumentation data points as the full corpus. We present results of 34+ CPU-years of fuzzing with five distillation approaches to understand their impact in finding bugs in real-world software."
230,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,paper_abstract,"In this paper, we explore the concept of multi-agent systems with partial observation, where multiple agents interact with each other and their environment without complete knowledge of the state of the other agents. We propose a new approach called a scalable supervisor, which is a template-based supervision mechanism that can handle multiple agents with different state transition structures. The scalable supervisor is designed to be efficient and scalable, meaning that its size and computational complexity do not increase significantly as the number of agents in the system grows.

We present a theoretical framework for synthesizing a scalable supervisor based on a given template, which is a high-level description of the system's behavior. The framework includes sufficient conditions for safety and maximal permissiveness, which ensure that the supervisor is both safe and flexible. We also provide an example of how the proposed approach can be applied to a simple multi-agent system.

Our main contribution is the introduction of a new notion of ""partial observation,"" which allows us to relax the assumption of complete observability in traditional supervisory control. By considering the partial observability of the agents, we can develop a more realistic model of multi-agent systems and design a more efficient and"

This method has the potential to improve the spatial resolution of sensing and biological labeling with the defects in solids by approximately 1.6 times in comparison with confocal microscopy. The simplicity of the experimental setup and data processing also suggests that this method can be used for improving the spatial resolution of sensing and biological labeling with the defects in solids."

We demonstrate the utility of our method through simulations and a real-data example of a survey of business establishments, showcasing its versatility across different modeling formulations and sampling designs. This work bridges recent advances in combining traditional survey estimation methods with Bayesian modeling, providing a comprehensive framework for unbiased inference in survey analysis."

In this scenario, an initially circular and narrow belt of planetesimals at semi-major axis $a$ has its eccentricity increased to $e_f$ after the gas disc has dispersed due to secular perturbations from an eccentric planet, resulting in a belt of width $2ae_f$. However, in a minor modification of this scenario, narrower belts can arise if the planetesimals are initially eccentric, which could result from earlier planet perturbations during the gas-rich protoplanetary disc phase. Alternatively, a primordial eccentricity could be caused by instabilities that increase the disc eccentricity without the need for any planets."
