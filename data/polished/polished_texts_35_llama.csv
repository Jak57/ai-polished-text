If everything goes well this week, we'll be set for closing a week from Wednesday. I was up until after 3 00 am last night watching movies with Bethany. There has been a lot of movie watching going on around here lately. Here's my rundown  last night we watched thirteen, a movie every mother of a teen should see. It was better than I expected. Then we watched Gigli, yeah, it was just as bad as the media said it was, but we had to see for ourselves."
2,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Summer television used to be a barren landscape of reruns, but now there are two exceptional new shows that have captivated my attention. One of these shows is 'Blow Out', a concept that initially seems absurd  hairstylist Jonathan Antin aims to open a second location for his successful West Hollywood salon in Beverly Hills. Typically, I wouldn't give this story a second thought, but while channel surfing, I stumbled upon Jonathan, who was enthusiastically discussing his vision for the new salon on Rodeo Drive. His bombastic declaration, 'I'm going to build the greatest salon in the history of the world!' was both cringe-worthy and intriguing. Not since Rocco have I found someone as fascinatingly flawed to watch."

When I move my arm excessively, especially while using a mouse on a computer, it becomes unbearable. I'm currently struggling to draw anything due to my recent marathon of updating my website and working on other online projects. Lack of sleep exacerbates my pain. I'm not thrilled at the moment, but I'm confident that I'll recover soon. My mother's surgery was a success, and her eyesight has partially recovered. She can now see fuzzy shapes and distinguish colors. Although she still has some vision loss, I'm hopeful that she'll regain her full sight soon."

I learned how sweet strangers can be, without any expectation of reward. It wasn't like they were trying to get into my pants or anything. I had kid drool all over me and was wearing my 'wash-day' outfit. Also, I'm not sure I'll ever bathe again, so it's not like there was an incentive. I'm doing two things simultaneously. I'm composing an email and watching videos. I'm doing both tasks at my desk in my room."
5,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"It's 11 14 PM MST, and I'm sitting in my bedroom, fixing the personal computer of my job's personnel director. While I don't mind doing it, I sometimes wonder how often I find myself fixing someone else's computer as a favor. I'm grateful to be able to love and serve people this way, but where is the line drawn where it becomes taking advantage? The past couple of weeks, I've been staying up late reading and such, so I was looking forward to hitting the sack early, until I realized it would be more practical to get this computer out of my bedroom and back into its owner's hands. I found myself watching Joe Schmo 2 again tonight."
6,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Remind me, what did I write about before this? Or, a continuation in the 'is this a date?' saga, so, after the weird lunch, my confidence shook, I forgot to tell you guys an important piece of the story. Before Pat shows up to lunch, Dusty starts talking about what a nice guy Pat is and how he's trying to find a girlfriend for him. I'm listening and nodding, realizing that we're talking more about finding Dusty's best friend a girl than discussing whatever it is you discuss with a stranger over pink lemonade. I excused myself to the bathroom, looked in the mirror, and then silently asked myself  Am I being pawned off to the other guy? Is this what happens now?"
7,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"I would like everyone to think before they act. Actually, I'd like each and every individual in the world to make a conscious decision before they start their day, making a commitment to think critically and reflect on their actions throughout the day. If they're not prepared to do so, I'd like them to take a moment to pause and reassess their priorities. I'm tired of people who act impulsively without considering the consequences. I'm not claiming to be the smartest person in the world, but I do think it's reasonable to call out thoughtless behavior. Let's focus on a few specific types of individuals today, and we'll save other topics for another time, sound good?"
8,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Two problems with the scenario outlined in my previous post  1. True, the bush administration is stimulating the economy, but in the wrong way. Robert Rubin told NPR's Marketplace today that the administration could have achieved the same stimulus effect without the long-term debt hangover by enacting different tax cuts, targeted at low- and middle-income individuals. Ah, Robert Rubin. The sound of his name is music to our ears. Quickly, can you name a Bush administration cabinet official with Rubin's gravitas? Still thinking? It'll come to you... 2. We can't give the Republicans control only in wartime because they've ingeniously concocted an endless, global 'war on terrorism.'"

Went to the cove to see Supernova, they were good as usual. Got to chill with Tiago. Sat. Went to work, then out with Joe and Rach, met up with Steve, Tiago, and Tom. Came home at a quarter to 12 and woke up the next morning at a quarter to 7 for a meet. Got there a little late, but it's all good. I did my full-on floor and didn't fall, second on floor and vault, and third on beam, 29.45 all around. That's not bad because my meets get better as the season goes on."

Like, you're sitting in math class, bored out of your skull, and you wonder what exactly goes on in your brain that makes you understand math? And you realize that you exist and you're in math class, and you wonder why. Then you realize how amazing existing is. Suddenly, it hits you - the fact that you're going off on this random train of thought is incredibly pathetic. Ever had that happen? I hate that. You know what else I hate? Block schedules. Who would ever come up with that idea? Anyone can see that sitting through a two and a half hour class in any subject is cruel and unusual punishment."

Tonight, Andy beat me by a few small dollars and won the farquing game, or maybe I let him win on account of him leaving in a few short hours and me wanting him to feel good on his last night here. Well, however the story goes, it can't compare to this Texas-sized headache I have at the moment. I've taken some Aleve and I must say that they are doing the trick, all I need now is some well-deserved R&R.

I'll have to be choosy about what I write about, as I could take up a lot of time and space, and I'm just not feeling energetic. First, I must say that camp was amazing and even better than I could have expected. God has been doing so much in my life lately, and it's incredible. I've turned over a new leaf, and I'm grateful for that. We arrived at the Twiggs' house on Friday evening and stayed until we left for camp on Monday. Most of our time was spent at the fair, church, a parade, Walmart, and watching movies."

As a perfectionist, I strive to excel in everything I do. However, I'm definitely nervous and anxious about this new experience.

14,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Arun Shourie highlights how, in 1996, the then Governor of Uttar Pradesh warned about the looming threat of a 'third Islamic State' emerging in the subcontinent. T.V. Rajeswar, the former Intelligence Bureau chief and current Governor of Uttar Pradesh, had previously written a series of articles in the Hindustan Times predicting this dire threat. Shourie raises a pertinent question: does the fact that Rajeswar, rather than he or Mr. Advani, wrote these warnings make them more credible? Or does one conclude that Rajeswar's persistence on this issue indicates he is a closet communalist, rendering him unfit to continue as Governor of Uttar Pradesh?"

However, it's great to see Tigger taking up the reins herself and making an appearance, discussing things. Not much to say about yesterday's events, yesterday was a lovely day at the park, but I had to leave before the closing curtain, which was a bit disappointing. I hope to see the entirety of a Shakespeare play someday. But I digress. As for the shower, it's true that Akcron is right about the problems with laughing at her in the shower, admittingly, the look people get when committing self-torture can be quite amusing."
16,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"All of a sudden, for the past two days, I've been overcome with terrible bouts of exhaustion. Bone-deep exhaustion. Last evening, I went home and just slept off, and only got up when my mother called me around 8 30. And when I woke up, it was pitch black dark, and I hadn't switched the lights on, so I couldn't figure out what time or date it was, for a few seconds, it was just my mother's voice in the darkness and me grappling with reality. I wonder why I'm feeling so drained... The weather this morning is nice. It was drizzling when I came. Although in Calcutta, I hear it's been raining for the past three days."
17,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Last night was a disappointing evening. I regretted throwing away the sweater I was knitting, as I had invested about 14 inches of work. The yarn, worth around $10, was a significant loss. However, I encountered difficulties with the stitches, particularly around the arm holes, and the mohair was knotting together as I knitted. Frogging didn't work well, and the yarn broke frequently. I didn't even swear, which is unusual for me. I simply removed the stitches and listened to season two of Sex and the City, only to become disenchanted and discard the project. Despite the frustration, I suppose I learned a lot from the experience."
18,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Last night in class, we discussed the assigned reading, ""Getting Back into Place  Toward a Renewed Study of the Place-World"" by Edward S. Casey. The first chapter explores ""implacement,"" while the second delves into ""displacement."" In the first chapter, Casey argues that our contemporary world and culture revolve around time as the situating force  we're running out of time, we've saved time, and we're just in time. He aims to demonstrate that using place as the center of culture fosters a more grounded community. This book is the first reading to have captivated me thus far."

And while giggling is good, one wonders if we would have found ourselves up that fire escape drinking beer in the fierce wind had we not been eating them earlier. Finding ourselves in a doorway to a bar sadly closed for business, we stopped to examine an office-supplies catalogue that had arrived in the post. Lucky we did. Who could possibly have guessed that within these pages were the special offers of a lifetime? Not I, for certain. I list but a few  buy 36 permanent marker pens, get a stunt kite.

20,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Currently listening to ""The Little Drummer Boy"" by Stevan Pasero. Meanwhile, I must admit that I found myself tuning in to the Senate's 39-hour judicial nominations spectacle last week. I know I didn't watch it extensively, but I did catch a few hours of it. The entire marathon was orchestrated by Republicans who, frustrated that Democrats wouldn't rubber-stamp four of Bush's controversial justices, were trying to score political points by prolonging the process. Interestingly, it's worth noting that Democrats have already confirmed 168 of Bush's judicial nominees, but that's apparently not enough for the power-hungry Republicans who seem to believe they have a mandate for this kind of theatrics."
21,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"This was an excellent weekend. I devoted a lot of time to reading, after a long hiatus, I indulged in a lot of nevermore (something I should have started earlier) and devoured three books. I finished Bruce Sterling's Heavy Weather, Larry Niven's World of Ptavvs, and Octavia Butler's Parable of the Sower. Heavy Weather was a thrilling cyberpunk adventure through a near-future USA ravaged by global warming and anarchy. Although it was cleverly crafted, well-paced, and vividly rendered, I must admit that I didn't come away with any profound sensations about the story or characters. Not that both aren't well constructed and vividly etched - it's a good book, but not a great one, I suppose."
22,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Following the first week back from practicum, I found the aftermath to be a struggle. However, it wasn't until the second week that the smoke began to clear. Post-practicum trauma was a hidden epidemic that is now coming to light. I was struck, but meeting with the course coordinator allowed me to release my burden and prevent another student from being stuck with a pedagogically deficient practicum. Yesterday, I ran into an agitated classmate who was determined to go to the student who was due to attend the next practicum and warn them about the difficulties they would face. I calmed her down and suggested we speak with the administrator first."

Rick, known as the Canuck, consistently beats me in a regular game - we have a ping pong table in the front lobby of our building, always available for a quick match. Last night, I participated in an 8-ball tournament at the hot spot, our recreation tent, which features a popcorn machine, multiple TVs, jukebox, DVD rentals, pool table, dartboard, and ping pong table. I had a decent start, but unfortunately, I scratched on the eight ball. Despite this, I still had a great time - the most enjoyable part was the two Dutch soldiers who joined the tournament."

I'm not a math person, nor am I now. I hate math; I'm math-phobic. You get the picture. As I struggled to make sense of algebra, the doorbell rang. I put down my book and went to open the door. No one was there. Great. I returned to my studies and, just as I was finding a little glimmer of understanding, the doorbell rang again. Just like that, my breakthrough disappeared. I went to the door, and once again, no one was there. Just what a struggling math student needs, an uninvited practical joker."

The new room is bigger and closer to my grade-level team, which are the things I need to consider as I spend hours upon hours preparing my room for this year. Had I known I was going to move prior to the end of my school year, I would have discarded much of the books and supplies I no longer use. Unfortunately, it all came with me. So, this week was spent moving, unpacking, and purging profusely. I have to thank my teammate, Jill, for helping with all of this.

Forever, I will always be reminded of the few precious nights we spent together, our hearts and limbs entwined in a soulful embrace, bathed in the salty darkness of an evening by the beach...

Let me rephrase that, the article I'm doing and its consequences is not something I'm comfortable with. Perhaps it's because I don't believe in it enough, so I cannot fully grasp its implications. The angst behind it, the full-out passion towards it, I question. I've grown up in a country where you don't ask questions. You just don't. They shoot you for that. They put you in jail with all these internal security measures. I'm not used to this freedom of speech, not used to questioning out loud. I'm not the easiest person to get along with."

We embarked on a 30-minute trek to the falls, pausing to catch our breath along the way. Whew! We finally reached the destination, where the chilly water left our bodies numb. We spent less than an hour there before heading to the nearby waterfalls, another 30-minute trek. Despite the challenges, the trip was rewarding, as the falls' calming atmosphere and breathtaking scenery left us in awe. The experience was akin to communing with nature, with the cold air and water lulling us into a peaceful slumber."

So we have a month left before Ed leaves. I think it's starting to sink in with Ed and with all of us. I think it's sunk in with me a long time ago.

Sunday morning when he woke up, he was so excited that the Easter bunny had come. There's nothing better than seeing the excitement on your child's face. After egg hunting, we all went to church.

As a non-American blogger, I've been a little reluctant to get involved in some of these discussions, particularly the bits about flags, but since I started it, I suppose I'd better say something. Firstly, I think that the idea of having a law against flag-burning is completely nuts. The moment you start according to a symbol - any symbol - that kind of automatic reverence and protection, you've taken a small but important step towards totalitarianism. Symbols are kind of fickle - they don't a priori represent anything in themselves; it's what they are perceived as meaning or made to represent that's important."

However, I believe too much energy was spent on the set, which was magnificent, and not enough on creating a solidifying tone, theme, etc. It retold the story, but it was not particularly gripping, and I don't feel like I gained anything from watching it. The character development was rather weak. Additionally, I thought the score was poor, and was basically a knock-off of the Gladiator. The Gladiator used the background music of a moaning woman, and it worked because it backed up and complemented a genuinely gripping narrative."

101,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"I think this Assassin's Creed nailed the mechanics down on all fronts - ship battles, sailing, hunting, parkour, and so on. I felt much more attached to this character as well. The story starts out extremely rough but does get much better as you play, I think this is true for every AC game personally. Edward was quite the interesting character and so were all the side characters. I felt like all the collectables actually meant something in this AC game that I never got from any of the previous ones, and maybe it's because I felt like they had a bigger purpose in the game. They were not required, but they were fun to get and you got rewarded in a very balanced way."
102,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"While I personally cannot recommend this game, it wasn't absolutely terrible. The gameplay is alright, as long as you have the money to purchase gun parts, which would be my main complaint. If I could get past that, the game would be enjoyable, as the hardsuit is fun to use. I'd take this game over any Call of Duty title any day, but its pay-to-win microtransaction format is off-putting. If you're alright with this model, then by all means, have fun."
103,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"While not perfect, this game has been greatly enjoyable. The save system and possibility of sudden death lead to some frustration. I'm on my first playthrough and I lost my main character around hour 10 of 20 hours. I would have really liked a save option to reload at that point. I've since picked up a third-party mod/save tool to avoid catastrophic failures. The aiming reticule is on the small side and zoom is underpowered. Despite these issues, it's been a blast. I'm not normally a zombie fan, but the combination of strategy, missions, first-person shooter/beat 'em up is great. I've been playing it as often as I can get away... Just one more mission, just one more supply run - or I'm running away and want to get safe before shutting the game down."
104,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"This is an absolute great strategy game! Having played every single other war game (European Escalation and Albion), I have to say this one fits well. The number of units is great. Not sure exactly how many units there are, but there are a plethora of them. Graphics are just beautiful, sounds are great, and the gameplay overall is epic. The in-game chat box at the main menu is very entertaining as well, no I'm not kidding. However, if you think this game is 'easy', or if you're new to the strategy genre, it could take you quite some time to get it nailed down. Don't get upset, you will lose a lot of units. Just make sure you plan ahead, always have anti-air, and anti-tank."
105,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"I was initially skeptical about this game before I played it. I wasn't even sure about buying it. I wasn't convinced by the whole portal gun and portals concept, even though I enjoy science fiction. But boy, I was wrong. The humor and voice acting in this game are phenomenal. The story and characters have their own unique sense of humor, and the level design is just great. I never played the first Portal game, but I'm planning to play it if I can find the time."
107,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Yes, this is a nostalgia trip for thirty-somethings who remember watching the ever-irritating Transformers cartoon. The voice actors for Optimus, Megatron, Bumblebee, and many others are back, and instantly recognizable. The distinctive cartoon transformation sound is there. Graphically, the cell-shaded presentation is perfect, and very, very Generation One. But aside from that, it's actually a very fun game. The combat mechanics are extremely well done. Transforming mid-fight is often a necessity, and woven seamlessly into combos, making it quite unlike High Moon's excellent War for Energon games. Another distinction is the heavy focus on melee combat, but some enemies (e.g., Seekers) require a switch to a ranged blaster, which adds depth to the gameplay."
108,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"So I downloaded the game and played it for a while, finding it unremarkable. I spent more time attempting to log in than actually playing the game. A persistent issue arises when the client prompts an update to the terms of service, which, upon clicking 'accept', simply reappears. To resolve this, I had to restart the client. While this isn't a significant issue, I'm concerned about linking my Steam and Gface accounts. They claim it's for DLC, but why is this necessary? Moreover, it's not reversible, so I'm now aware that a company I don't care about has access to my Steam information. The game itself is underwhelming. It's easily recognizable as a CoD clone, except somehow they managed to make the gunplay even worse."
109,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"4K+ at 60fps (GTX 970) and dual audio options, plus Neptune Gear, make for an excellent package. The game's excellent port serves as a great entry point for newcomers to the series. Keep in mind that there is a significant amount of (skip-able) dialogue. While a gamepad is recommended, I had no issues with a keyboard and mouse setup, which is fully rebindable. The price is reasonable, and I wouldn't have been disappointed with a purchase. The game includes over half of the DLC for free, providing ample content. I highly recommend it to JRPG, anime, and visual novel fans, as long as you're willing to tolerate occasional breaks in the action. Cheers.

110,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"I experienced no performance issues, even at release, and after all these patches, it plays really well. In my opinion, this is a really great and fun game in truth, although the format may be somewhat annoying (where the free-roam city area repopulates with new enemies every time you progress the story). I particularly enjoyed the 'dual play' segments, where you can play Batman +1 more, and the ability to use the controller for most segments of the game, but the mouse and keyboard for the tank combat segments was greatly appreciated. Driving your Batmobile around the free-roam city, including when chasing the APC commanders, is actually quite enjoyable once you figure out how to use the brakes to sidestep around corners, and when you master that, driving around the city is really quite enjoyable."
111,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Damn fine FPS shooter - that's the bottom line. It looks, sounds, and plays great - great FPS mechanics, nice story, cool characters, flawless voice acting, and a badass soundtrack. Not for the faint-hearted though - some of those cutscenes were pretty darn cruel and vivid. But when a game is so great, it's easier to spot the flaws, and here they are  no slow-down support - what a letdown. I had to put the game away until I upgraded my card, as it ran too poorly on my old dual GPU GTX 590. Make sure you have a fairly decent single GPU card. - stupidly small obstacles are often unclimbable."

I will break down this review into a few categories  graphics, controls, sound, and replayability. Graphics  the game features a comic-like style with very slick, detailed visuals and nice color schemes. The graphics can be set on 'high' without straining your system. I run this game on an i5 Pentium processor, with an Nvidia GeForce 710M card, 8GB of memory, and Windows 8.1. Controls  the game can be played with a keyboard and mouse, but also with an Xbox controller."
113,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"You can see by the hours I've invested in this game that I thoroughly enjoy it. This is everything I wished a search game from Cod would be. But don't buy this game thinking it's like Cod, Battlefield, or any other shooter game. It's a game in its own class and should be treated as such. I've heard countless times from new players who complain about getting killed quickly. Oh, the horror! It's not like that happens in real life or anything. I've invested a significant amount of time and money into this game, and I can confidently say it's one of the best multiplayer games around. It's a great option to play when you're not feeling CS GO."
114,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"I'm two hours in and I'm dying from laughter from this game. The gameplay is solid, the art design is beautiful, the music is surprisingly high-quality and fitting, and the story/world has me hooked. I'm particularly impressed by the comedy. If you've played any RPGs since the dawn of video games, you'll laugh at the various jokes, parodies, and references. If you're new to RPGs, you'll still enjoy the game for its humor. If you played Final Fantasy 7 or X, you absolutely need to play this game, without giving away too much... I had to pause playing after two hours to give my cheeks a break from laughing and smiling so much. What a delight so far."
115,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"I'm truly sorry, I tried to be supportive of free-to-play games and indie developers, but I really didn't enjoy this game. The description sounded right up my alley, but the execution fell short for me. I love puzzle and exploration games, but I found this game to be completely unintuitive, and even after looking up how to progress, I still just didn't find the gameplay itself enjoyable. It also lacks a pause button, which seems like a critical oversight, given that many sequences in the game are timed. I also feel like this game is a lot more cutscene than it is game, and I end up just sitting around drumming my fingers a lot."
116,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"This game was an incredible experience. I was hooked from the story to the graphics. The story wasn't just a story, but it felt like I was that person, trying to figure out what came next in the story that my character was telling. Gameplay was great, and I learned a lot about myself through this game. My gut churned the whole time, but I kept going for Uncle Fred. If you guys made a DLC or second game, I would be the first to buy it and recommend it to everyone I know. Thanks to everyone involved in making this, you made an absolutely beautiful game."
117,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Sid Meier's Civilization Beyond Earth is a turn-based game in which you build your civilization to a certain goal or 'victory'. In this game, you're set in the future on a mission to colonize a new planet. What I enjoy about this game is that it took a new approach to the game and added new mechanics such as the affinity system and orbital layer. However, what I didn't enjoy was that the game could be overwhelming at times. I think what could be improved is incorporating some new artwork, such as the environment you experience when communicating with another leader."
118,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Great game! Tons of replayability and very fun zombie survival game! In my top 5 zombie games ever played. After playing 60+ hours, I can honestly say this is one of the better, more realistic zombie games. It's very much designed like a survival horror, where you must save up your ammo, heal your own wounds when you bleed out, take pills when you're infected, and so on. I find the zombies to feel very natural to be well-animated for a free-to-play game. I would recommend getting one or two friends to play with, as the community is super friendly and you can usually make friends/talk with the people in the chat or over voice comms."
119,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"02/07/2014 - It's a shame I can't thoroughly recommend or enjoy this game, as from the short time I've played it, I know I'd be addicted if it didn't have the following two game breakers. No Aussie servers - one red bar puts you at a severe disadvantage, and creates unbearable lag. I played through the offline training mode and it was stuttering and lagging as well (how does that even happen?). Couple that with the poor ping, and it just ruins the game. Everything, like the menus, backgrounds, training, and in-game, is a mess. I've never had this happen before with this card and thought it might not like my OC. I set my GPU back to stock and sure enough, and it didn't make a difference."
120,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Last night, I finished this game. The story may not be particularly deep or captivating, but the storytelling shines. The atmosphere is rich and the many collectibles do a great job of fleshing it out. I learned a lot about the world of Batman, so it was a little disappointing that there were so few boss battles in the game. However, there are enough future games to rectify that. The combat is the right amount of challenge, but it's slightly on the easy side. Leveling up Batman wasn't very satisfying. It's the gadgets you upgrade and acquire during the campaign that add for nice new gameplay mechanics. Getting access to previously unreachable places makes for a sense of progression."
121,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"To the moon is no mere game; nay, it is a veritable experience, and it was one of the best of my life at that. Think Telltale's the walking dead is sad? Hohoho! Well, it's no match for to the moon! Never before have I been so depressed yet fulfilled over something purely fictional. This masterpiece represents the pinnacle of storytelling in my opinion, and the soundtrack is a gorgeously charming and perfect accompaniment. Yes, the controls are a bit finicky and the gameplay is not the strong point, but the story is so fantastic that I did not care one bit. Plus, the humor of the game is great and it definitely does not intrude upon the distinguished nature of the story, and the references to the doctor are endless."
122,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Bastion is a brilliant game, with a great storyline. After a calamity, you start rebuilding on the bastion. The game offers a lot of choice, from choosing what to build to give you an advantage, to selecting weapons and power-ups for those weapons, as well as drinks to use for bonus effects. The art style and music are fantastic, making the game visually stunning at times. The narration is also player-driven, with the story adapting to the player's actions. If you pick up a weapon, the narration will adapt to your new choice, commenting on your decision to switch to another in the armoury."
123,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"I originally purchased this game during its early development, when the primary currency was spacebux, and the tech tree was nonexistent. At this stage, the game was enjoyable. All the guns at this point were equally overpowered, eliminating any concerns about balance; everyone could kill anyone at any moment. The game also provided unlimited gun slots and five loadouts. You might expect that for a game with an immense arsenal of guns, they would offer more than six weapon slots and three loadouts before requiring additional payment. In reality, I had approximately three pages' worth of guns and was planning new ideas for more, as I found it entertaining."
124,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"This game was a delightful discovery. One often sees glowing reviews of certain products that are often misleading. In this case, the reviews accurately capture the fun of this charming little game. It's an unusual blend between a classic 2D platformer and a MOBA, and it pulls it off with flair. I found myself enjoying characters I wouldn't typically enjoy in other MOBA games. I had expected this trait to continue, but decided to give a melee tank a try anyway. I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome and ended up trying out more as they were unlocked from playing games. The art style and interface are quaintly charming. As such, I now use one of the characters as my avatar and a wallpaper from creating a card set for the game."
125,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"I recently started playing and have become deeply engrossed in the game, often losing track of time. It's been a while since a game has had such a profound impact on me. The music perfectly sets the mood, sound effects are spot on, and controls are seamless. I eagerly anticipate each combat, and they've executed combat exceptionally well. Initially, I had some reservations about the naval combat system, but it's surprisingly enjoyable to unleash havoc on multiple fleets at once. The only way to lose is to fail to retreat. If combat appears overwhelming, simply retreat, regroup, and counter-attack. Thanks to the developers for an incredible experience!"
126,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"The reboot of the Devil May Cry franchise has brought about many changes for the series, particularly for its protagonist, Dante. While fans of the original series may be upset at the change to their beloved character, it's certainly for the better; and this new game by Ninja Theory proves it. The game serves as the perfect point for newcomers to jump into the series. It shows the origins of an arrogant, cynical Dante, and it chronicles his journey from cynicism to selflessness. Throughout, the game weaves a clear, narrative arc for the new Dante, making him a compelling character to watch."
127,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Where do I start on this stunning game? It's story is absolutely charming, with so much detail put into it, and it's a bundle of happiness, bad puns, and secrets. The character design is on point, with various characters having distinct personalities and secrets to them. It stands out from other RPGs because you don't have to kill anyone, which is an unused concept in RPGs. With lots of inspiration from Earthbound, one of the best RPGs I've seen, you can tell it's going to be good. It has one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a long time."
128,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"I'm recommending this game solely because it's free and might be a more enjoyable experience for others. As for my experience, the game didn't do much for me. Half the story relies on shock value. I wasn't shocked nor emotionally moved in any way by this. Maybe I'm desensitized, or maybe it was too simple to warrant a reaction out of me. The other half of the game tries to paint a picture of a person in mental decline. It deals with obsession, hallucinations, depression, and a few other things. In theory, it's a cool idea. Unfortunately, the game took me 10 minutes to complete, and that's with reading and taking in every little bit of information I could."
129,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Do I even need to explain why Portal is amazing? Portal is a puzzle game that presents a concept, then gets out. It's an amazing way to test your mind while still being fun. Although this game isn't as story-heavy, it gave birth to one of the most popular games of 2011. I still play this game and love to come back and see what gave birth to a legend and what is a legend. The gameplay is quite simple  you use portals to your advantage, along with buttons that activate a part of the puzzle. Two buttons are in the game, one that you press and one that you need a cube to put on."
130,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"If you can overlook the minor bugs, I can definitely recommend this game. The one minor bug and the other quite annoying bug have been resolved, resulting in a significant increase in my FPS from 60-90 to 80-120. I'll include my specs  i5 6600k, Radeon RX 480, Z170 Pro Gaming, 16GB DDR4 RAM, and a total cost of around €650. While this rig is quite new, it's definitely within the medium price range. I can genuinely say that I'm almost constantly getting 60+ FPS on high settings with vsync enabled, which is impressive considering 90% of the comments say they're running an overkill setup and getting 20 FPS."
131,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Remember the age of mythology? Indeed, it's been a while since there's been an RTS game of such quality. Divinity  Dragon Commander reaches awfully close to these borders of my personal most favorite RTS game. Combine this with a huge risk-like grand strategy mode and there, it hits the spot. I'm not (read  try not to be) overly biased due to the fact that this game allows you to turn into a dragon, aiding your troops by supporting, attacking, and even commanding unit production, direction, and spawning at the very same time. Honestly, I do like the complex RTS games nowadays. Think of Civilization V and so on. However, such games attempt to cram complex mechanics, charts, and resources all into one complicated game mode."
132,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Undertale comes together to make something greater than the sum of its parts. The graphics are solid for a retro title and the music is nice, but paired together they make some truly beautiful and impactful moments. The script runs the gamut from comedic to dramatic to heartbreaking to hopeful, sometimes all at once, and does this while turning RPG tropes on their head. And all of this without touching on the world, characters, story, gameplay... I could write whole pages about it. But instead, I'll just say this  if you like RPGs, play this game. If you like video games, play this game. If you have seven free hours between now and your death, play this game."

The developers are very active in the community, and it shows in the various discussion forums and dev diaries. There is a fairly steep learning curve to the game's mechanics, of which I am still trying to learn; however, this breadth of strategy allows you a myriad of ways to reach goals and take advantage of certain situations."
135,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Warframe is a fun game for the initial hours of play. After those hours, you'll begin to see that the game's content is repetitive, with limited variety in combat, enemies, and gameplay. The major highlight is the developers' dedication to regular updates, which often include significant changes to the game's systems, new Warframes, and other features. It's a good game for casual play. While it may not hold your attention for an extended period, it's worth trying out. The upside is that the game is free, so I recommend giving it a try. If you're looking for a quick fix, it's worth a try."
136,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"This game is extremely underwhelming. I purchased this game believing it was a PC version of 'Katamari Damacy', a well-known and enjoyable PS2 game. Unfortunately, it falls short of my expectations. In this game, you progress by absorbing increasingly larger objects to grow bigger and absorb bigger things. However, the gameplay isn't as smooth as it could be, and the levels lack inventiveness, leaving what's in it feeling like a surreal horror show. I don't mean an entertaining horror show, but one that makes you question whether being alive is all it should be. Every 'living' creature in this game, from small pets to human beings, makes me wonder if the creators of this game had an interest in taxidermy."
137,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Alright, let me explain a few things as someone very interested in politics. I was very interested in this game when I first heard about it. I thought, ""Oh wow! A simulator of the road to becoming president! That sounds fun!"" Well, it really wasn't. The game starts you off and says you need to pick a side  Republican or Democrat, there is no independent, or third party. A little disappointed, but still optimistic, I continued on to see what I could do. I will give the game credit, the character customization, although limited, is pretty fun to mess around with. It's the only time it's an option to wear your head or not in a campaign."
138,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Fallout 3's story was better. Settlers get in the way of the story to the point you'll hate babysitting them instead of playing the story. Some keys are hard-coded and cannot be rebound. Bugs galore. My Pip-Boy disappeared permanently at one point and had to research console commands to get it back. You don't have to work for power armor; it's basically given to you from the beginning of the game, and power cores are everywhere in trader shops. The value of power armor is diminished greatly from previous Fallout games. The story is mediocre, everything about this game is mediocre except it doesn't crash every 10 minutes like Fallout 3. Very stable compared to Fallout 3. While it's not as bad as some make it out to be, it's not better than Fallout 3. This title was overhyped for how bad it actually is."

What I liked  visuals up until the last level (Ice Caves), story is not that great, but the ending (after the closing credits) kind of made me not regret so much spending my time playing this game. What I disliked  visuals in the last level are uninteresting, gameplay in the last level gets much harder, making it become a frustrating experience of having to do a lot of things over and over again until you get it right. Achievements are too hard. There are 13 (out of 15) that only less than 2.1% of players achieved."

While the game's scale is initially awe-inspiring, it also hindered my enjoyment due to the steep learning curve and the time it took to do anything interesting. Perhaps if I were more patient, it would be more compelling. However, I don't have the time and there are other VR games I'd rather spend my time on."
144,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Hands down, my favorite first-person shooter of all time. Run-and-gun rambos need not apply. Recoil and ballistics are realistic. Single hits to the chest, neck, or head from rifle-caliber weapons almost always result in death unless it just grazes you. Rounds drop over distance and short, controlled bursts are required if you wish to remain on target. There is no magical ammunition pool. If you reload half-way through your magazine all the time, you will have a pouch full of half-full mags. You can't run forever. If you sprint for a while, your aim will suffer as you gasp heavily until you have caught your breath. Rest your weapon on your elbows while prone or on a window sill to steady your aim. Accuracy suffers when standing."

I loved that game, however, it was unforgiving in the early stages, but rewarding when you did things right. As for XCOM 2, I love it; the game plays pretty well for me on medium, and I'm running a GTX 560 with 2GB of VRAM. At first, the game set it to high, and it was running a bit sluggishly, but not to the point of being unplayable. But when I dropped it down to medium, it smoothed out. I'm not sure if I'm just lucky when it comes to having issues with games or what, but it seems that most of the negative reviews sound like they're coming from some really entitled people."

However, it has some drawbacks, such as grind-intensive gameplay, subpar AI teammates, and a limited variety of equipment types and leveling skills. Despite these drawbacks, there is still some variety and strategy to be had. The game starts off quickly and maintains its pace. Even with a limited selection of equipment, it feels like there's always another ship to unlock or skill to level up. To maximize the game's potential, mods are the way to go. The fight for universe is easily the star, but a big fight for beef is also very good."

This deadline marks the point at which Fiat will gain the right to sell its car division to GM, part of an alliance agreed in 2000. GM, whose European operations are struggling, no longer wants to own Fiat's unprofitable unit. Reports of deadlocked talks sent Fiat shares tumbling 1.2% on Tuesday, following a 4% gain on Monday on hopes of a resolution. GM is reportedly offering around $2bn (£1.06bn) to extricate itself from the arrangement. It has argued that the deal was voided by Fiat's decision to sell off its finance arm and reduce GM's stake through a capital-raising effort.

The club, the first Arab side to participate in European competition, will face English Premier League team Newcastle United in the first round. Murambadoro, who impressed at the African Nations Cup finals in Tunisia, played a crucial role in helping Bnei Sakhnin defeat Partizani Tirana 6-1 in the previous round. The 28-year-old goalkeeper recently joined the club after a brief stint with South African side Hellas. Last season, Hapoel Bnei Sakhnin won the Israeli Cup and are based in Sakhnin, near Haifa.

According to a University College London study, reducing the limit from 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood to 50mg would save 65 lives annually. The findings are being published by the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety as MPs prepare to vote on the government's road safety bill. The bill includes changes to speeding fines, but not the drink-drive limit. The research, conducted by transport expert Professor Richard Allsop, also suggests that cutting the limit would lead to 230 fewer serious injuries on the UK's roads compared to 2003, saving the country £119 million annually. A previous estimate, contained in a 1998 Department of Transport document, suggested a similar move could save 50 lives a year."
198,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"This paper introduces a millimeter-scale CMOS 64x64 single charged particle radiation detector system for external beam cancer radiotherapy. A 1x1 μm² diode measures energy deposition by a single charged particle in the depletion region, and the array design provides a large detection area of 512x512 μm². The proposed system measures pulse width, the time it takes for the voltage to return to its baseline, instead of sensing voltage drops caused by radiation. This eliminates the need for power-hungry analog-to-digital converters. A prototype ASIC is fabricated in TSMC 65 nm LP CMOS process and consumes an average static power of 0.535 mW under 1.2 V analog and digital power supply. The system's functionality is successfully verified in a clinical 67.5 MeV proton beam setting."

However, the assumption that AVs would readily allow themselves to be controlled externally by a central agency is unrealistic. In this paper, we propose a joint routing and pricing control scheme that aims to incentivize AVs to seek centrally controlled system optimal routing by saving on tolls while user equilibrium seeking AVs and human-driven vehicles (HVs) are subject to a congestion charge. The problem is formulated as a bi-level optimization, in which dynamic tolls are optimized in the upper level, whereas the lower level is a mixed equilibrium simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment model considering a mixed fleet of AVs and HVs."
200,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"Optomechanics and electromechanics have enabled the creation of macroscopic mechanical oscillators in their quantum ground states, in quadrature squeezed states, and in entangled states of motion. This capability has inspired ideas for using mechanical oscillators in the processing and communication of quantum information and as precision force sensors operating beyond the standard quantum limit. However, the linear interaction between motion and light or electricity prevents access to the broader class of quantum states of motion, such as cat states or energy squeezed states. Early optomechanical proposals suggested the possibility of overcoming this restriction by creating strong quadratic coupling between motion and light. Although there have been experimental demonstrations of quadratically coupled optomechanical systems, these have not yet accessed non-classical states of motion."
201,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"Online reviews provide product evaluations for customers to make informed decisions. However, the evaluations can be compromised by professional spammers who have developed increasingly sophisticated and powerful spamming strategies to evade detection. These strategies are difficult to capture as they can quickly adapt to new detectors and target various products. Moreover, most existing detectors prioritize detection accuracy, which is not aligned with the goal of maintaining the trustworthiness of product evaluations. To address these challenges, we propose a minimax game where spammers and detectors compete with each other on their practical goals that are not solely based on detection accuracy. Nash equilibria of this game lead to stable detectors that are agnostic to any mixed detection strategies."
202,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"We developed single-shot shaped pulses for ultra-high fidelity population transfer on a 3-level quantum system in lambda configuration. To ensure high fidelity, we employ the Lewis-Riesenfeld method to derive a family of solutions leading to an exact transfer, where the solutions follow a single dynamical mode of the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant. Among this family, we identify a tracking solution with a single parameter to control simultaneously the fidelity of the transfer, the population of the excited state, and robustness. We define a measure of the robustness of an ultra-high-fidelity transfer as the minimum percentile deviation on the pulse areas at which the infidelity rises above 10^-4. The robustness of our shaped pulses is found superior to that of Gaussian and adiabatically-optimized pulses for moderate pulse areas."
203,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"In this paper, we examine the landscape of the population negative log-likelihood function of Gaussian mixture models with a general number of components. Due to nonconvexity, multiple local minima exist, even when the mixture is well-separated. We demonstrate that all local minima share the same structural form, which partially identifies the component centers of the true mixture. Each local minimum involves a non-overlapping combination of fitting multiple Gaussian distributions to a single true component and fitting a single Gaussian distribution to multiple true components. Our results apply to the setting where the true mixture components satisfy a certain separation condition and are valid even when the number of components is over- or under-specified. For Gaussian mixtures with three components, we obtain sharper results in terms of the scaling with the separation between the components."

This orbifold is defined as a quotient by a suitable subgroup g of the phase symmetries of the hypersurface x_m in the weighted projective space, cut out by a quasi-homogeneous polynomial w_m. The first, Berglund-H\""ubsch-Krawitz (BHKS) construction, uses another weighted projective space and the quotient of a new hypersurface x_mt inside it by some dual group g^t. In the second, Batyrev construction, the mirror partner is constructed as a hypersurface in the toric variety defined by the reflexive polytope dual to the polytope associated with the original Calabi-Yau orbifold. We provide a simple evidence of the equivalence of these two constructions."

In this hybrid model, a metabolic energy minimization strategy is combined in a racing process, with a non-linear description of the movement of the mass center's libration, attempting to reproduce the behavior of the walk-run transition. The results of the experimental data, for various speed regimes, suggest that the perimeter of the trajectory of the mass center is a crucial quantity in quantifying this dynamic process. An experimental procedure was conducted in collaboration with the research group in biomedical engineering, basic sciences, and laboratories of the Manuel Beltrán University in Bogotá, Colombia."
206,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"We present a novel mixed variable symplectic (mvs) integrator for planetary systems, capable of fully resolving close encounters. The method is based on a time regularization technique, which maintains the stability properties of symplectic integrators while reducing the effective step size during close encounters. A high-order mvs scheme enables integration with large time steps, even in regions far from close encounters. We demonstrate that this algorithm can resolve almost exact collisions (i.e., with a mutual separation of a fraction of the physical radius) using the same time-step as in weakly perturbed systems, such as the solar system. We showcase the long-term behavior of six super-Earths experiencing strong scattering over 50,000 years. Our algorithm is compared to hybrid methods, including Mercury, and shows that for an equivalent cost, we achieve significantly better energy conservation."
207,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"Entanglement is a key resource for quantum information processing. A widely used tool for detecting entanglement is entanglement witness, where the measurement of the witness operator is guaranteed to be positive for all separable states and can be negative for certain entangled states. In reality, the exponentially increasing Hilbert-space dimension with respect to the system size makes it challenging to construct an efficient entanglement witness for general multipartite entangled states. For n-partite GHZ-like states, the most robust witness scheme requires n+1 local measurement settings and can tolerate up to 1/2 white noise. In comparison, the most efficient witness for GHZ-like states only needs two local measurement settings and can tolerate up to 1/3 white noise."
208,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"Within general relativity, the unique stationary solution of an isolated black hole is the Kerr spacetime, which has a peculiar multipolar structure depending only on its mass and spin. We develop a general method to extract the multipole moments of arbitrary stationary spacetimes and apply it to a large family of horizonless microstate geometries. The latter can break the axial and equatorial symmetry of the Kerr metric and have a much richer multipolar structure, providing a portal to constrain fuzzball models phenomenologically. We find numerical evidence that all multipole moments are typically larger (in absolute value) than those of a Kerr black hole with the same mass and spin. Our results suggest that current measurements of the quadrupole moment of black-hole candidates place only mild constraints on fuzzballs, while future gravitational-wave detections of extreme mass-ratio inspirals with the space mission LISA will improve these bounds by orders of magnitude."
209,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"Reasoning about graphs evolving over time is a challenging concept in many domains, such as bioinformatics, physics, and social networks. We consider a common case in which edges can be short-term interactions or long-term structural connections. In practice, long-term edges are often specified by humans. Human-specified edges can be both expensive to produce and suboptimal for the downstream task. To alleviate these issues, we propose a model based on temporal point processes and variational autoencoders that learns to infer temporal attention between nodes by observing node communication. As temporal attention drives between-node feature propagation, using the dynamics of node interactions to learn this key component provides more flexibility, while simultaneously avoiding issues associated with human-specified edges."

211,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"We establish natural splittings for the values of global Mackey functors at orthogonal, unitary, and symplectic groups. In particular, the restriction homomorphisms between the orthogonal, unitary, and symplectic groups of adjacent dimensions are naturally split epimorphisms. The interest in the splitting stems from equivariant stable homotopy theory. The equivariant stable homotopy groups of every global spectrum form a global Mackey functor, so the splittings imply that certain long exact homotopy group sequences split into short exact sequences. For the real and complex global Thom spectra mo and mu, the splittings imply the regularity of various Euler classes related to the tautological representations of o(n) and u(n)."

The poorly constrained shape and amplitude of this suppression are an important source of uncertainties for upcoming cosmological weak lensing surveys such as Euclid or LSST. In this paper, we use simulations to build a Euclid-like tomographic mock data-set for the cosmic shear power spectrum and the corresponding covariance matrix, which are both corrected for baryonic effects following the baryonification method of Schneider et al.

In addition, we develop an emulator to obtain fast predictions of the baryonic power suppression, allowing us to perform a likelihood inference analysis for a standard LCDM cosmology with both cosmological and astrophysical parameters."

In this paper, we present our approach to designing an open-source neural network to classify audio segments into vocalizations produced by children, vocalizations produced by other children, adult male speech, and adult female speech.

214,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"Density-based clustering relies on the idea of linking groups to specific features of the probability distribution underlying the data. The reference to a true, unknown, population structure allows framing the clustering problem in a standard inferential setting, where the concept of ideal population clustering is defined as the partition induced by the true density function. Nonparametric modal clustering draws a correspondence between the groups and the domains of attraction of the density modes. Operationally, a nonparametric density estimate is required, along with a proper selection of the amount of smoothing, governing the shape of the density and hence possibly the modal structure, to identify the final partition. We address the issue of density estimation for modal clustering from an asymptotic perspective."
215,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"The tails of diboson production at the LHC are sensitive to the interference between standard model and higher-dimensional operators parameterizing the effects of heavy new physics. However, helicity selection rules for the diboson scattering amplitudes set an obstruction to the naive interference contributions of dimension six operators, causing the total diboson rate correction's leading contribution to cancel. In this case, carefully measuring the azimuthal decay angles ""resurrects"" the interference, recouping sensitivity to the ""non-interfering"" operators. We explore these signatures in detail, and find that the EFT uncertainties associated with higher-dimensional operators are uniquely well-suppressed by the construction of an asymmetry variable which is only generated by these non-interfering operators, relegating the effects of higher-dimensional, interfering operators to the same status as statistical errors in this observable."
216,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"Causal inference from observational data is the goal of many data analyses in the health and social sciences. However, academic statistics has often frowned upon data analysis with a causal objective. The introduction of the term 'data science' provides a historic opportunity to redefine data analysis in such a way that it naturally accommodates causal inference from observational data. We organize the scientific contributions of data science into three classes of tasks  description, prediction, and counterfactual prediction (which includes causal inference). An explicit classification of data science tasks is necessary to discuss the data, assumptions, and analytics required to successfully accomplish each task. We argue that a failure to adequately describe the role of subject-matter expert knowledge in data analysis is a source of widespread misunderstandings about data science, and we believe that this lack of clarity has led to a misinterpretation of the term 'data science'."
217,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"The weak gravity conjecture demands the existence of superextremal particles in any consistent quantum theory of gravity. The standard lore suggests that these particles are introduced to ensure that extremal black holes are either unstable or marginally stable, but it remains unclear what goes wrong if this doesn't happen. This note shows that, for a generic Einstein quantum theory of gravity in AdS, the stability of extremal black branes is in tension with rigorously proven quantum information theorems about entanglement entropy. Avoiding the contradiction leads to a non-perturbative version of the WGC, which reduces to the usual statement at weak coupling. The argument is general and does not rely on either supersymmetry or a particular UV completion, assuming only the validity of Einstein's gravity, effective field theory, and holography."
218,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"Understanding how strongly correlated two-dimensional (2D) systems can give rise to unconventional superconductivity with high critical temperatures is a major unsolved problem in condensed matter physics. Ultracold 2D Fermi gases have emerged as clean and controllable model systems to study the interplay of strong correlations and reduced dimensionality, but direct evidence of superfluidity in these systems has been lacking. Here, we demonstrate superfluidity in an ultracold 2D Fermi gas by moving a periodic potential through the system and observing no dissipation below a critical velocity vc. We measure vc as a function of interaction strength and find a maximum in the crossover regime between bosonic and fermionic superfluidity. Our measurement establishes ultracold Fermi gases as a powerful tool for investigating the influence of reduced dimensionality on strongly correlated superfluids."

Despite their widespread use in modeling, the frequent lack of analytic solutions makes it challenging to estimate ODE parameters from the data, particularly when the model has numerous variables and parameters. This paper presents a Bayesian ODE parameter estimation algorithm that is fast and accurate even for models with many parameters. The proposed method approximates an ODE model with a state-space model based on equations of a numeric solver. It enables fast estimation by avoiding the computation of the entire numerical solution in the likelihood.

We find that the differential conductance and induced pairing amplitudes strongly depend on the angle between the junction direction in real space and the axis separating the Weyl nodes in momentum space. The chiral chemical potential, i.e., the electron population imbalance between Weyl nodes of opposite chirality, significantly influences the transport characteristics of the junction. Notably, we observe a net spin polarization of Cooper pairs generated via Andreev reflection in the two WSM regions. The spin polarization is opposite in the two WSM regions and highly sensitive to the chirality imbalance and excitation energy."
221,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"Metal ion implantation into ceramics has been demonstrated as an effective and controllable technique for tailoring the surface electrical conductivity of the ceramic piece, and this approach has been used in a number of applications. It provides a method for grading the voltage drop across high-voltage insulators, thereby increasing the maximum operational voltage that can be applied across the insulator without surface flashover. However, a concern for the use of the method is the long-term stability of the implantation-induced conductivity, especially if the implanted metal species is readily oxidized. Here, we report on our examination of the long-term behavior of the surface conductivity of titanium-implanted alumina. The results indicate that after an initial drop of up to 40% in the first few weeks after implantation, the conductivity shows only a very slow decrease of approximately 10% over the following year."

The associated charge is equivalent to the Skyrme charge for any smooth configuration. Notably, singular configurations emerge, which can be identified as n_f=1 baryons charged under the new symmetry. The vector mesons play the role of Chern-Simons vector fields on the quantum Hall droplet forming the n_f=1 baryon. We propose that this current accurately represents the baryon current at low energies. This proposal provides a unified framework for the two types of baryons, enabling a natural transformation between them. Moreover, Chern-Simons dualities on the droplet can be seen as a Seiberg-like duality between gluons and vector mesons."

We theoretically investigate how the superposition of both effects influences the transport properties of superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator/superconductor junctions. Transverse momentum-dependent skew tunneling of Cooper pairs through the spin-active ferromagnetic insulator interface generates sizable transverse Hall supercurrents, which we refer to as anomalous Josephson Hall effect currents. We generalize the Furusaki-Tsukada formula to evaluate the transverse current components and demonstrate that their amplitudes are widely adjustable through spin-orbit coupling strengths or the superconducting phase difference across the junction. Well-localized subgap bound states form around the interface, serving as a clear spectroscopic fingerprint of Josephson junctions."

It is found that the kinetic energy of this flow is carried by elongated streams formed by the concatenation of dipoles. Vortices separate into a family of small, fast-moving cores and another family of larger, slowly moving ones, which can be described as 'frozen' into a slowly evolving 'crystal'. The kinematics of both families are very different, and only the former is self-similar."

We apply our techniques to the glued-trees problem, improving their hitting time upper bound by a polynomial factor  from O(n^5) to O(n^2 log n).

Dry (or the ""loss-cone"") EMRIs, previously considered as the main EMRI sources for the laser interferometer space antenna, are primarily produced by multi-body scattering in the nuclear star cluster and gravitational capture. We highlight an alternative EMRI formation channel  wet EMRI formation assisted by the accretion flow around accreting galactic-center massive black holes (MBHs). In this channel, the accretion disk captures stellar-mass black holes that are initially moving on inclined orbits, and subsequently drives them to migrate towards the MBH, boosting the formation rate of EMRIs in such galaxies by orders of magnitude."

This problem falls into the new user cold-start category, which is crucial to the development and survival of a company. Existing works on user cold-start recommendation either require additional user efforts, such as setting up an interview process, or leveraging side information like user demographics, locations, social relations, etc. However, users may not be willing to take the interview, and side information on cold-start users is usually not available."

It has also been successfully applied in wireless communications. A better approach is to jointly learn the whole receiver, rather than learning individual parts of a receiver. However, this often results in a challenging nonlinear problem, for which the optimal solution is infeasible to implement. To address this, we propose a deep fully convolutional neural network, deeprx, which executes the whole receiver pipeline from frequency domain signal stream to uncoded bits in a 5g-compliant fashion. We facilitate accurate channel estimation by constructing the input of the convolutional neural network in a specific manner using both the data and pilot symbols."
229,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"Mutation-based fuzzing typically uses an initial set of non-crashing seed inputs, derived from a corpus, to generate new inputs by mutation. A corpus of potential seeds often contains thousands of similar inputs. This lack of diversity can lead to wasted fuzzing effort by exhaustive mutation from all available seeds. To address this, fuzzers come with distillation tools, such as afl-cmin, that select the smallest subset of seeds that triggers the same range of instrumentation data points as the full corpus. Common practice suggests that minimizing the number and cumulative size of the seeds leads to more efficient fuzzing, which we explore systematically.

The scalable supervisor under partial observation does not require re-computation regardless of how many agents are added or removed from the system. We generalize our results to partial observation by proposing sufficient conditions for safety and maximal permissiveness of the scalable least restrictive supervisor on the template level.

We used a differential excitation protocol to extract the high spatial frequency information. By modulating the excitation laser's power, the spatial resolution of imaging was improved approximately 1.6 times in comparison with the confocal microscopy.

Our approach differs from frequentist methods that rely on numerical integration, as only the Bayesian method achieves both unbiased estimation with respect to the sampling design distribution and consistency with respect to the population generating distribution. Our simulations and real data example for a survey of business establishments demonstrate the utility of our approach across different modeling formulations and sampling designs.

These main processes replace each other in a temperature range of about 50 degrees. Dielectric spectroscopy also made it possible to distinguish two processes of orientational relaxation  the first is due to rotation of the side mesogenic groups, and the second is associated with motion of the main chain segments."

However, this paradigm may lead to more and more hash bits being stuck into the wrong saturated area of the activation functions and never escaping. We call this problem ""dead bits problem."" Besides, the existing quantization loss will exacerbate this issue.

In a minor modification of this scenario, narrower belts can arise if the planetesimals are initially eccentric, which could result from earlier planet perturbations during the gas-rich protoplanetary disc phase. However, a primordial eccentricity could alternatively be caused by instabilities that increase the disc eccentricity, without the need for any planets."
240,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"An electron is typically considered to have only one type of kinetic energy, but could it have more, due to its spin and charge, or by exciting other electrons? In one dimension, the physics of interacting electrons is captured well at low energies by the Tomonaga-Luttinger-liquid model, yet little has been observed experimentally beyond this linear regime. Here, we report on measurements of many-body modes in 1D gated-wires using a tunneling spectroscopy technique. We observe two separate Fermi seas at high energies, associated with spin and charge excitations, together with the emergence of three additional 1D'replica' modes that strengthen with decreasing wire length. The effective interaction strength in the wires is varied by changing the amount of 1D inter-subband screening by over 45%."
241,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"The assembly history of the Milky Way is currently being unveiled thanks to the data provided by the Gaia mission. It is likely that the globular cluster system of our galaxy has followed a similarly intricate formation path. To constrain this formation path, we explore the link between the globular clusters and the known merging events that the Milky Way has experienced. To this end, we combined the kinematic information provided by Gaia for almost all galactic clusters, with the largest sample of cluster ages available after carefully correcting for systematic errors. To identify clusters with a common origin, we analyzed their dynamical properties, particularly in the space of integrals of motion. Results show that about 40% of the clusters likely formed in situ."
242,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"The estimation of the intrinsic dimension of a dataset is a fundamental step in most dimensionality reduction techniques. This article illustrates intrinsic, an R package that implements novel state-of-the-art likelihood-based estimators of the intrinsic dimension of a dataset. In detail, the methods included in this package are the two-nn, gride, and hidalgo models. To allow these novel estimators to be easily accessible, the package contains a few high-level, intuitive functions that rely on a broader set of efficient, low-level routines. Intrinsic encompasses models that fall into two categories  homogeneous and heterogeneous intrinsic dimension estimators. The first category contains the two-nn and gride models. The functions dedicated to these two methods carry out inference under both the frequentist and Bayesian frameworks. In the second category, we find hidalgo, a Bayesian mixture model, for which an efficient Gibbs sampler is implemented."
243,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"Spintronic nanodevices have ultrafast nonlinear dynamics and recurrence behaviors on a nanosecond scale, promising to enable spintronic reservoir computing (RC) systems. Here, two physical RC systems based on a single magnetic skyrmion memristor (MSM) and 24 spin-torque nano-oscillators (STNOs) were proposed and modeled to process image classification tasks and nonlinear dynamic system prediction, respectively. Our micromagnetic simulation results show that a single MSM can process handwritten digits recognition tasks with outstanding performance on image classification. Additionally, complex unknown nonlinear dynamic problems can be well solved by a physical RC system consisting of 24 STNOs in a second-order nonlinear dynamic system and 10 tasks."
244,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"Ranking algorithms play a crucial role in online platforms, including search engines and recommender systems. We identify a surprising consequence of popularity-based rankings  the fewer items reporting a given signal, the higher the share of the overall traffic they collectively attract. This 'few-get-richer' effect emerges in settings where there are few distinct classes of items, such as left-leaning news sources versus right-leaning news sources, and items are ranked based on their popularity. We demonstrate analytically that this effect occurs when people tend to click on top-ranked items and have heterogeneous preferences for the classes of items. Using simulations, we analyze how the strength of the effect changes with assumptions about the setting and human behavior. Our findings have important implications for understanding the spread of misinformation."
245,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"Weight pruning has been widely acknowledged as a straightforward and effective method for eliminating redundancy in deep neural networks, thereby achieving acceleration on various platforms. However, most pruning techniques are essentially trade-offs between model accuracy and regularity, leading to impaired inference accuracy and limited on-device acceleration performance. To address this issue, we introduce a novel sparsity dimension, namely pattern-based sparsity, which encompasses pattern and connectivity sparsity, and achieves both high accuracy and hardware friendliness. Our approach on the new pattern-based sparsity naturally fits into compiler optimization for highly efficient DNN execution on mobile platforms."
246,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"Difference-in-differences analysis with a control group that differs significantly from a treated group is vulnerable to bias from historical events that have different effects on the groups. Constructing a more closely matched control group by matching a subset of the overall control group to the treated group may result in less bias. We examine this phenomenon in simulation studies. We examine the effect of mountaintop removal mining on mortality using a difference-in-differences analysis that utilizes the increase in mountaintop removal mining following the 1990 clean air act amendments. For a difference-in-differences analysis of the effect of mountaintop removal mining on mortality, we constructed a more closely matched control group and found a 95% confidence interval that contains substantial adverse effects along with no effect and small beneficial effects."
247,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"When constructing models to summarize clinical data for simulations, it is good practice to evaluate the models for their capacity to reproduce the data. This can be done by means of visual predictive checks, which consist of several reproductions of the original study by simulation from the model under evaluation, calculating estimates of interest for each simulated study, and comparing the distribution of those estimates with the estimate from the original study. This procedure is a generic method that is straightforward to apply, in general. Here we consider the application of the method to time-to-event data and consider the special case when a time-varying covariate is not known or cannot be approximated after event time."

We discuss how similar protocols, relying both on repeated quantum measurements and dynamical decoupling control pulses, can enable us to  (i) confine and protect quantum dynamics from decoherence in accordance with the zeno physics. (ii) analytically predict the probability that a quantum system is transferred into a target quantum state by means of stochastic sequential measurements. (iii) optimally reconstruct the spectral density of environmental noise sources by orthogonalizing in the frequency domain the filter functions driving the designed quantum-sensor. The achievement of these tasks will enhance our capability to observe and manipulate open quantum systems, thus bringing advances to quantum science and technologies."

Around 15% of American workers don't have traditional full-time jobs. They're part-time, contract workers, or temps. The term ""side hustle"" fits perfectly with this ethos where people put together a few different things to make a living. The word ""side hustle"" has its roots in popular African American newspapers from the 1920s, where they used it to refer to some kind of scam. By the 1950s, it also referred to legitimate work.

When plants and other living things die, much of their stored carbon makes its way back to the atmosphere until new plants grow and reabsorb the carbon. Over millions of years, some of the carbon stored in ancient trees and sea life becomes rock, and some becomes fossil fuels  coal, oil, and natural gas. Natural events like volcanic eruptions release some of the carbon trapped in rock, and human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, also release some of that prehistoric carbon. Today, humans release around 60 times more carbon than all the volcanoes on the planet each year, and this excessive release has significant environmental implications."
289,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"Even nature's most reviled creatures harbor important secrets, but who would welcome a swarm of cockroaches approaching them? Yet, one of the most striking differences between natural and human technologies lies in robustness. Robust systems exhibit stability in complex and novel environments. Notably, cockroaches can self-stabilize while running over rugged terrain. When we fitted them with a jet pack or introduced an earthquake perturbation, we found that their remarkably tuned legs enable self-stabilization without engaging their brainpower. They effortlessly navigate complex terrain, such as grass, without destabilization. We discovered a novel behavior where, due to their shape, they naturally roll onto their side to traverse this artificial grass test. Robust systems can perform multiple tasks with the same underlying structure. We've uncovered a new behavior as a result."

And so, I'd like to lift your spirits with one of the great, albeit lesser-known, commercial success stories of the past two decades. Comparable to the achievements of Microsoft or Google, it's an industry that has bucked the current recession with remarkable resilience. I refer to organized crime. Now, organized crime has been around for a very long time, I'm told, and these would be wise words, indeed. But in the last two decades, it has experienced an unprecedented expansion, now accounting for roughly 15 percent of the world's GDP. I like to call it the global shadow economy, or the McMafia, for short. So, what triggered this extraordinary growth in cross-border crime?"
291,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"If you ask people about what part of psychology do they think is hard, and you say, ""what about thinking and emotions?"" most people will say, ""emotions are terribly hard. They're incredibly complex. They can't — I have no idea of how they work. But thinking is really very straightforward  it's just sort of some kind of logical reasoning, or something. However, that's not the hard part. Here's a list of problems that come up. One nice problem is, what do we do about health? The other day, I was reading something, and the person said probably the largest single cause of disease is handshaking in the west, which is a significant issue that affects many people."
292,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"What is a parent? What is a parent? It's not an easy question. Today, we have adoption, stepfamilies, and surrogate mothers. Many parents face tough questions and tough decisions. Shall we tell our child about the sperm donation? If so, when? What words to use? Sperm donors are often referred to as ""biological fathers,"" but should we really be using the word ""father""? As a philosopher and social scientist, I have been studying these questions about the concept of parenthood. But today, I will talk to you about what I learned from talking to parents and children. I will show you that they know what matters most in a family, even though their family looks a little different."
293,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"When I look in the mirror today, I see a justice and education scholar at Columbia University, a youth mentor, an activist, and a future New York State senator. I see all of that and a man who spent a quarter of his life in state prison - six years, to be exact, starting as a teenager on Rikers Island for an act that nearly cost a man his life. But what propelled me from there to here wasn't the punishment I faced as a teenager in adult prison or the harshness of our legal system. Instead, it was a transformative learning environment in a classroom that introduced me to something I didn't think was possible for me or our justice system as a whole. A few weeks before my release on parole, a counselor encouraged me to enroll in a new college course being offered in the prison, which ultimately set me on a path towards redemption and a brighter future."
294,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"What do you think when you look at me? A woman of faith? An expert? Maybe even a sister. Or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist. Or just an airport security line delay. That one's actually true. If some of your perceptions were negative, I don't really blame you. That's just how the media has been portraying people who look like me. One study found that 80% of news coverage about Islam and Muslims is negative. And studies show that Americans say that most don't know a Muslim. I guess people don't talk to their Uber drivers. Well, for those of you who have never met a Muslim, it's great to meet you."
295,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"We need to build a weather service for water. However, until we collectively demand accountability, the incentives to fund it will not exist. The first time I spoke at a conference was here at TED, eight years ago. Fresh out of grad school, little did I know that in those few minutes onstage, I was framing the questions I was going to be asked for the next decade. And, like many 20-somethings, I expected to solve the world's problems, particularly the world's water issues, with my technology. I had a lot to learn. It was seductive, believing that our biggest water quality issues persist because they're so hard to identify. But I was wrong."
296,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"Indeed, for 20 years, I worked in finance. I knew everything about finance, for sure. I knew the global economy, as it was my life. All the topics that you could bring up about ecology, the end of the world, etc., that I knew like the back of my hand, I didn't really believe in them. In 2007, an extremely unusual event occurred - the subprime crisis, the collapse of big American banks. It was an electric shock. I had a few stormy conversations with my wife about the matter, on the limits of the model. Besides the crisis, I realized that I was completely wrong, that we were heading for disaster."
297,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"So, I'll be speaking to you using language, because I can. This is one of the magical abilities that we humans possess. We can transmit complex thoughts to one another. So, what I'm doing right now is making sounds with my mouth as I'm exhaling. I'm creating tones and hisses and puffs, and those are generating air vibrations in the air. Those air vibrations are traveling to you, they're hitting your eardrums, and then your brain translates them into thoughts. I hope. I hope that's happening. Because of this ability, we humans are able to transmit our ideas across vast distances and time. We're able to share knowledge across minds."

It's 1988, and scientist James Hansen has just testified to the United States Congress that global warming trends are caused by human activity, and will pose an increasing threat to humanity in the future. Well, well. That's unusually prescient for a human. Looking for a wedding dress? Try a new take on a timeless classic. It's sleek, flattering, and modest—just like the traditional dress. Could anything be more insufferable? It's 1997, and the United States Senate has called a hearing about global warming. Some expert witnesses point out that past periods in Earth's history were warmer than the 20th century."

It's an honor to give a TED Talk, especially here in the UK, where politics has faced a reputation crisis due to expenses scandals."
