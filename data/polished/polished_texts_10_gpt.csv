1,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"Another week just flew by. I drove past the new house yesterday, and the front window was covered in boxes. We may get the keys at closing; I am getting so excited. If all goes well this week, we will be set for closing a week from Wednesday. I was up until after 3:00 a.m. last night watching movies with Bethany. There has been a lot of movie watching going on around here lately. Here's my rundown: last night, we watched Thirteen, a movie every mother of a teen should see. It was better than I expected. Then we watched Gigli; yeah, it was just as bad as the media said, but we had to see for ourselves."
2,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"Summer television used to be a dead zone full of repeats or uninspiring content. But now there are two great new shows on TV, and I have been watching both religiously for the last week. ""Blow Out"" is the most flamboyant concept ever with seemingly no gay people in sight. Hairstylist Jonathan Antin wants to build a second location for his incredibly popular West Hollywood salon, but this time in Beverly Hills. Normally, no one would care, certainly not me, but as I was flipping through the channels, I caught a glimpse of Jonathan, equally narcissistic and dull, looking at an empty space on Rodeo Drive and saying (in a public voice), 'I am going to build here the greatest salon in the history of the world ever!' and I was hooked. Not since Rocco have I found such a fool, a compelling TV watching experience."
3,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"What a week ... My right shoulder has tendinitis. It's right under my shoulder blade. So, when I move my arm too much, mainly with a mouse on a computer ... it kills me. I can't move it much now because I was on a spree updating my website and working on other online things. I can barely muster the strength to draw anything. Lack of sleep adds to my pain. I'm not too happy right now, but I'll get better. My mom's surgery went okay. Her eyesight has come back somewhat. She can see fuzzy shapes and make out colors. Other than that she's still blind as all sin. Hopefully she'll fully regain her vision soon."
4,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"Strangers’ kindness... Attempted laundry today with the kids in tow and realized how quickly the simplest things can become an ordeal. I also learned how remarkably sweet total strangers can be for no reason other than that they feel like being sweet. Trust me. It wasn't like they were trying to get into my pants or anything. I had kid drool all over me and was wearing my 'wash-day' outfit. Also, I’m not sure I’ll ever be bathing again, so it's not like there was even an olfactory incentive there! I am doing two things right now. I am composing a post, and I am also watching the collected No Doubt videos. I am doing both of these things sitting at my desk in my room."
5,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"It's 11:14 PM MST, and here I sit in my bedroom fixing the personal computer of the personnel director from my job. Not that I mind doing it, but I sometimes wonder how often I find myself fixing someone else's computer as a favor. I'm glad to help and connect with people this way, but where is the line drawn to avoid being taken advantage of? The last couple of weeks, I've been staying up late reading and such, so I was looking forward to hitting the sack early, until I realized it would be more prudent to get this computer out of my bedroom and back into its owner's hands. *Laugh* No rest for the weary, right? So I found myself watching Joe Schmo 2 again tonight."
6,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"Remind me, what did I write about before this? Or, a continuation in the 'Is This a Date?' saga. So, after the weird lunch, my confidence shaken, I forgot to tell you guys an important piece of the story. Before Pat shows up to lunch, Dustin starts talking about what a nice guy Pat is and how he's trying to find a girlfriend for him. I'm listening and nodding, realizing that we're talking more about finding Dustin's best friend a girl than discussing whatever you discuss with a stranger over pink lemonade. I excused myself to the bathroom, looked in the mirror, and then silently asked myself: Am I being pawned off to the other guy? Is this what happens now?"
7,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"I would like everyone to think before they act. In fact, I’d like each and every person in the world to think before they get out of bed in the morning and commit to thinking all day. If they’re not prepared to, I’d prefer they hop back in bed and drift off to an eternal slumber. I’m sick of stupid people. No, I’m not the smartest person in the world, but I’m not talking about things that require a lot of brainpower, so I think it's fair to criticize the inanely stupid. Let’s see if I can keep this particular rant to a few specific types, and we’ll save some for another day. Sound good? Great."
8,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"Two issues with the scenario outlined in my previous post: 1. Although Bush is stimulating the economy, it's being done improperly. Robert Rubin told NPR's Marketplace today that Bush could have achieved the same stimulus effect without the long-term debt hangover by enacting different tax cuts—specifically, temporary ones that would benefit low- and middle-income individuals. Ah, Robert Rubin. The sound of his name is music to our ears. Quick: name one Bush administration cabinet official on the domestic side with Rubin's gravitas. Still thinking? It'll come to you... 2. We can't give Republicans control only in wartime because they've ingeniously concocted an endless, global 'war on terrorism.'"

Went to the cove to see Supernothing; they were great as usual. Got to hang out with Tiago. On Saturday, I went to work, then out with Joe and Rach. Met up with Steve, Tiago, and Tom. Came home around a quarter to 12 and woke up the next morning at a quarter to 7 for a meet. Arrived a bit late, but it was fine. I completed my routine on floor without falling, placed second on floor and vault, and third on beam, with a 29.45 all-around score, which isn't bad since my meets improve as the season progresses."
10,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"Do you ever have one of those moments when you begin to reflect on life? Maybe you're sitting in math class, bored out of your mind, and you wonder what exactly goes on in your brain that makes you understand math. You realize that you exist and you're in math class, and you wonder why. Then you realize how amazing existing is. Suddenly, it hits you—the fact that you're going off on this random train of thought is incredibly pathetic. Ever had that happen? I hate that. You know what else I hate? Block schedules. Who thought up that idea? Anyone can see that sitting through a two-and-a-half-hour class in any subject is cruel and unusual punishment."
11,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"I think Monopoly has run its course in my life, and I vow to never lay my hands on that cursed iron (not a hot one, but the piece in the game) again. Tonight Andy beat me by a few small dollars and won the ridiculous game, or maybe I let him win on account of him leaving in a few short hours and me wanting him to feel good on his last night here. However the story goes, it can't compare to this Texas-sized headache I have at the moment. I've taken some Aleve, and I must say that they are doing the trick. All I need now is some well-deserved R&R. Your telephone's the one that helped me wrap the cord around your neck... At the drive-in."
12,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"Today's been a long day. We had to drive home from Indiana. I'm going to have to be choosy about what I write because I could take up a lot of time and space, and I just don't have the energy. First, I have to say that camp was awesome and even better than I could have expected. God's been doing so much in my life lately, and it's just incredible. I've turned over a new leaf, I guess, but anyway, back to the beginning. We arrived at the Twiggs' house on Friday evening and stayed until we left for camp on Monday. Most of what we did was go to the fair, church, a parade, Walmart, and watch movies."
13,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"Today is my last day of summer vacation! Waaaaaa! And I have a dentist appointment at 9. I hate that, but I'd rather get it over with than try to schedule it during the first month of my surgery rotation. I'm definitely nervous, scared, jittery, and any other words you can think up for 'hell's no, I don't wanna go' to school. This is going to be a whole new ball game for me. As a perfectionist, I love excelling at everything I do. But starting new things is tough. I hate being a pawn (like I told Cassie: 'I'm going to be the only pawn on the chessboard who insists on moving like a knight'), and I hate not knowing what's going on."
14,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"Arun Shourie discusses how the current governor of Uttar Pradesh had warned, as far back as 1996, about the impending threat of the rise of a so-called 'third Islamic state' in the subcontinent. T. V. Rajeswar, the former head of the Intelligence Bureau and the current governor of Uttar Pradesh, predicted this dire threat in a series of articles published in the Hindustan Times in 1996. Shourie raises a valid point when he asks whether the fact that you now know that he, and not I, to say nothing of Mr. Advani, wrote all that makes the warnings ring true? Or do you conclude that because he wrote in this vein, T. V. Rajeswar is a closet communalist and should not be allowed to continue as governor of Uttar Pradesh?"
15,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"Attitude: bored, mood: indifferent. Looking forward to tonight after a long, hard day in the trenches, folks. Almost no time to write for you readers. However, it's good to see Tigger (now Akcron) taking up the reins herself, making an appearance, and talking about things :) Not much to say about things. Yesterday was Shakespeare on the Green—a lovely play, but I had to leave before the closing curtain, which kinda sucked. Hopefully, someday I'll see the entirety of a Shakespeare play. But I digress. Akcron is right about the problems with the shower; it sucks. In terms of laughing at her in the shower, you have to admit, the look people get when committing self-torture can be pretty entertaining."
16,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"All of a sudden, over the past two days, I have been overcome with terrible bouts of exhaustion. Utter exhaustion. Last evening, I went home, fell asleep, and only woke up when my mother called me around eight-thirty. When I woke up, it was completely dark, and I hadn’t switched the lights on, so I couldn't figure out what time or date it was. For a few seconds, it was just my mother's voice in the darkness and me grappling with reality. I wonder why I'm feeling so drained... It's nice weather this morning. It was drizzling when I came. Although in Calcutta, I hear it's been raining for the past three days."
17,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"Last night was the worst. I discarded the sweater I was knitting. I only had about 14 inches. I lost probably $10 worth of yarn (it's $8 a skein). But it had too many stitches by the time I got to the armholes, and the mohair was knotting together as I knitted, so frogging (ripping out rows) didn’t work well. The yarn broke frequently. I didn’t even swear, which is unusual for me. I just morosely ripped and listened to season two of Sex and the City (way to go, library!). And then I got tired of it and threw it out. I suppose I could say I learned a lot while trying to make this sweater."
18,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"Last night in class, we discussed that week’s assigned reading, ""Getting Back into Place: Toward a Renewed Study of the Place-World,"" by Edward S. Casey. The first chapter addresses “implacement” and the second, “displacement.” In the first chapter, Casey distinguishes that our contemporary world and culture revolve around time as the situating force: we are running out of time, we have saved time, we are just in time. He argues that using place as the center of culture creates a more grounded community. (That is a very rough summation, a disclaimer just in case my professor or any other classmate happens to read this post.) So far, this book is the first reading that has grabbed me by the proverbial shoulders."

And while giggling is good, one wonders if we would have found ourselves up that fire escape drinking beer in the fierce wind had we not been eating them earlier. Finding ourselves in a doorway to a bar sadly closed for business, we paused to examine an office-supplies catalog that had arrived in the mail. Lucky we did. Who could possibly have guessed that these pages contained the special offers of a lifetime? Not I, for certain. I list but a few: buy 36 permanent marker pens, get a stunt kite. Buy 30 lever arch files, get a barbecue."

I know I didn't. Well, okay—I did tune in once or twice. The entire colossal waste of time was perpetrated by Republicans who, angry that Democrats wouldn't roll over and nominate four of Bush's extreme justices, were trying to score political points by holding a multi-day cry-fest. Never mind that the Democrats have already approved 168 of Bush's judicial nominees—no, that's not good enough for the power-mad Republicans who are, for some reason, laboring under the misapprehension they have a huge mandate for this kind of nonsense."
21,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"This was a great weekend. I enjoyed a lot of nature, after a long time, I listened to a lot of Nevermore (something I should have started doing much earlier) and read a lot. I finished three books over the weekend - Bruce Sterling's Heavy Weather, Larry Niven's World of Ptavvs, and Octavia Butler's Parable of the Sower. Heavy Weather was an exciting cyberpunk romp through a near-future USA, devastated by global warming and general anarchy. While it was clever, well-paced and altogether very convincing, I must confess that I failed to come away with any really significant impressions about the story or the characters. Not that both aren't well constructed and vividly etched - it's a good book, but not a great one, I guess."
22,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"After the first week back from practicum, I struggled, but it was only in the second week that things began to clear up. Post-practicum trauma is a hidden issue that is just now coming to light. I was affected, but meeting with the course coordinator allowed me to release my burden. By doing so, I have prevented another person from being stuck with a pedagogically deficient practicum school. Yesterday (Monday), I encountered an aggrieved classmate who was determined to warn the student assigned to her school about how terrible it will be. I calmed her down and suggested that we should go to the administrator first."
23,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"Things are incredibly busy here at times, but there's always time for supposed stress-relieving activities. I've found that I really struggle with 8-ball and ping pong! Rick (the Canuck) beats me regularly—we have a ping pong table in the front lobby of our building, always time for a quick round. Last night, I participated in an 8-ball tournament over at the hot spot (our recreation tent—complete with popcorn machine, numerous TVs, jukebox, DVD rental, pool table, dart board, and an ever-present ping pong table). Anyway, I was doing pretty well throughout my one entire game until I scratched on the eight ball. I still had a fairly good time—the most fun was with the two Dutch soldiers that joined the tournament."
24,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"Fall 1974: I was attempting for what felt like the 13th time to fight my way through the second chapter of my high school algebra book. I was not a math person then, nor am I now. I hate math. I am math-phobic. You get the picture. As I struggled to make sense of algebra, the doorbell rang. I put down my book and went to open the door. No one was there. Great. I returned to my studies, and just as I was finding a small glimmer of understanding buried in my subconscious, the doorbell rang again. Bam, just like that, my breakthrough disappeared. I went to the door, and once again, no one was there. Just what a struggling math student needs, an uninvited practical joker."
25,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"This past week has been nothing short of exhausting. I spent Tuesday to Thursday finishing the move to my new classroom. The new room is bigger and closer to my grade-level team, important factors as I spend hours upon hours preparing my room for this year. Had I known I would be moving prior to the end of the school year, I would have discarded many of the books and supplies I no longer use. Unfortunately, it all came with me. This week was spent moving, unpacking, and purging extensively. I have to thank my teammate Jill for helping with everything. You see, she was still teaching this month, in my old room. So she and her wonderful students moved almost my entire room for me!"

Forever I will always be reminded of the very few nights we spent together, hearts and limbs entwined in a soul-embrace, drenched in the salty darkness of an evening by the beach ...

Or let me rephrase that: the article I'm doing and its consequences are not exactly something I'm comfortable with. Perhaps it is because I don't believe in it enough, that I cannot really get the complete feel for it. The angst behind it. The full-out passion towards it to question. I've grown up in a country where you don't ask questions. Really, you just don't. They shoot you for that. They put you in jail with all these internal security acts. I am not used to this freedom of speech...not used to questioning out loud. Sure, I am not the easiest person to get along with."

We trekked to the falls, which was about a 30-minute walk. We were all catching our breath. Whew! But we made it. The water was icy cold. You could feel your body getting numb because of the chill. We stayed less than an hour because we headed to the nearby waterfalls, another 30 minutes of trekking. However, the trip was worth it because the falls looked calming and the whole scene was indeed breathtaking. It's as if you could hear yourself becoming one with nature. Soaking in the cold water felt like communing with Mother Earth. The cold air and water were enough to lull you to sleep."

Thank goodness I brought a bag of eggs with me just in case. So, Connor had a great time finding eggs in the park. Sunday morning, when he woke up, he was so excited that the Easter Bunny had come. There is nothing better than seeing the excitement on your child's face. After egg hunting, we all went to church. Even though the 'Easter Bunny' is fun, we make sure our kids know the true meaning of the holiday. This was Megan's first Easter; she looked so cute dressed in her jean dress and stockings."

By Gary Fineout and Alfonso Chardy. The citizenship ceremony in Jacksonville seemed to proceed as usual, with a crowd of nearly 200 people leaving as new Americans. Just before the new citizens departed the June 29 event, an immigration official directing the swearing-in urged them to stop by a voter registration table—a common sight at naturalization ceremonies. But this table was unusual: those distributing forms were Republican volunteers—and the party affiliation box had already been checked to make all the new voters members of the GOP. All of it was suspicious to Linda Cross, who was there to witness her husband, Dario Cruz, take his citizenship oath."

As a non-American blogger, I've been somewhat reluctant to engage in some of these discussions, especially the parts about flags, but since I started it (the subject, not the flag-burning), I suppose I'd better say something. Firstly, I think that the idea of having a law against flag-burning is completely nuts. The moment you start giving a symbol—any symbol—that kind of automatic reverence and protection, you've taken a small but important step towards totalitarianism. Symbols are rather fickle—they don't a priori represent anything themselves; it's what they are perceived as meaning or made to represent that's crucial."

Re: Loss of Continuity in PX Day Ahead Auction Due to ISO Rule Changes  

The emergency tariff filing by the California ISO last Friday has negatively impacted the PX Day Ahead Auction Market. The combination of soft and hard caps leads to a complete disconnect and unacceptable risk for all our participants, likely failing to provide the ISO with the intended reduction in real-time energy sales and procurement. The overall effect will be that supply will still defer to the higher realized price opportunity the ISO offers. The PX is petitioning Terry Winter of the ISO to immediately allow for adjustment bids on any submitted schedule at any price deemed relevant."

This allows services to sell unit contingent energy as hourly firm since BPA is supplying reserves for up to 60 minutes. If Grays Harbor Paper notifies RT of a unit derate or outage, RT should notify BPA dispatch immediately and make the reduction in the schedule during the next ramp. For example, should Grays unit trip at 1333, RT would notify BPA and the sink so that at the top of the hour for 1400, the schedule would be taken to zero for HE 1400.

If downstream, why isn't it being contracted for by EWEB? 2. What volume is being sold each day? You use the term DCQ and also talk about a 20% tolerance above or below the estimated quantity. Normally, there would be no tolerance with a DCQ transaction. 3. Is this envisioned to be a requirements transaction? Is the price the same for volumes exceeding the estimated quantity by up to an additional 20%?"

This review is purely based on playing MyCareer, and so far it's 10/10. Face scan worked really well for me (used it twice, the first one gave me a strange forehead though..).

97,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"Magic fans beware... Wizards is hesitant to create a decent digital game. At its core, Magic: The Gathering is a social game—a game to enjoy with your friends (or frenemies), laughing, bantering, and unleashing game-winning moves. Wizards of the Coast seems to have overlooked this. If you choose to play with friends, you can't earn gold, which is crucial. Gold is so crucial that they have implemented a daily cap, understandable since gold unlocks everything in the game. But prepare for a long and monotonous 1v1 grind against the computer or random opponents, whom you can't even speak to.

98,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"Being the third installment in the trilogy, I'll address the negative aspects first. I quite dislike prequels, as they technically move backwards in a story rather than forwards (this is an issue with every prequel). Granted, they offer more in terms of story. The combat feels sloppy and lacks the sharpness that Arkham City managed to achieve. As of writing this recommendation (26/10/2013), there is a game-breaking bug that prevents a side mission from ever being completed (main story not affected). Some gadgets are assigned to a ridiculous hotkey, forcing your hand to travel across the entire keyboard. It might sound trivial, but in combat it could potentially disrupt your combo."
99,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"They expertly refined Shadow Warrior (2013). The boss fights are fantastic, and weapons feel very satisfying (perhaps not as impressive as Doom's, but still solid). Enemies aren't too resilient (if you wisely handle elemental and upgrade elements). The upgrade system is well-balanced, and once you understand it, it's not too tedious. The elemental features and limited ammo gently encourage you to use various weapons. There are many cool, unique (an important point when comparing SW2 to Borderlands' formula of 'random' weapons) weapons that remain effective through most of the game. The music is excellent, especially the main theme and, of course, Stan Bush's contributions."

My player is an outside scorer, pg, 1.71m, has maxed stats and already obtained all necessary perks. OK, and now tell me, why does shooting skill depend on a person's height? Why can a person who is 1.74m not become as good at shooting as a person with 1.71m? I'm 1.87m in real life, created my first player with this height, and noticed I cannot reach a skill above 89. Why? That's pure discrimination! And why doesn't the game tell me that before I create a character and not even when I reach the skill limit after weeks of playing?!"
101,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"I think this Assassin's Creed nailed the mechanics on all fronts (ship battles, sailing, hunting, parkour, etc). I felt much more attached to the character as well. The story starts out quite rough but does get significantly better as you play (I think this is true for every AC game, personally). Edward was quite the interesting character, as were all the side characters. I felt like all the collectibles actually meant something in this AC game, unlike any of the previous ones. Maybe it's because they had a bigger purpose in the game. They definitely were not required, but they were fun to collect, and you got rewarded in a very balanced way."
102,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"While I personally cannot recommend this game, it wasn't absolutely terrible. The gunplay is decent, provided you have the money to purchase gun parts, which is my main complaint: it's pay-to-win. If I could overlook that, the game would be enjoyable, as the hardsuit is fun to use, and HRV is an excellent idea. I'd choose this game over any Call of Duty title any day, but its pay-to-win microtransaction format is off-putting for me. If you are comfortable with this model, by all means, have fun. But if you're like me and dislike pay-to-win games, just let this one slide; it's not our cup of tea."
103,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"While not perfect, this game has been highly enjoyable. The save system and risk of sudden death can lead to some frustration. I'm on my first playthrough and lost my main character around hour 10 of 20ish. I would have really appreciated a save to reload at that point. I've since picked up a third-party mod/save tool to avoid catastrophic failures. Additionally, the aiming reticule is somewhat small and the zoom is underpowered. With all that said, it's been a blast. I'm not usually a fan of zombie games, but the combination of strategy, missions, first-person shooter/beat ‘em up elements is great. I've been playing it as often as possible... Just one more mission, just one more supply run—or I’m running away and want to get safe before shutting the game down."
104,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"An absolutely great strategy game! Having played every single other wargame (European Escalation and ALB), I have to say this one fits well. The number of units is great. Not sure exactly how many units there are, but there's a ton! Graphics are beautiful, sounds are great, and the gameplay overall is epic. The in-game chat box at the main menu is very entertaining as well, no I am not kidding. However, if anyone thinks this game is 'easy', or if you are new to the strategy genre, it could take you quite some time to get it nailed down. Do not get upset, you will lose a lot of units. Just make sure you plan ahead, always have anti-air and anti-tank."

I didn't know—the whole portal gun and portals thing seemed weird to me even though I like science fiction. Boy, was I wrong. The jokes and voice acting in this game are phenomenal. Just amazing. It's not cheesy (okay, it's sometimes cheesy). And different story characters each have their own sense of humor. Those different characters really have distinct personalities. And the level design; it's just rad. By the way, I never played the first Portal game. One of these days, I'm planning to if I can spare the time. I would never have played it if I hadn't played the sequel."

Okay, now for my thoughts. I love this game. This game is probably one of the best RPGs or games, in general, I have ever played. If you're an RPG fan, you probably already have this game."
107,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"Certainly, here's the polished version with exactly 12 words edited:

Yes, this is a nostalgia trip for thirty-somethings who remember (at least in the UK) watching the ever-irritating Timmy Mallet just for the five-minute Transformers cartoon. The voice actors for Optimus, Megatron, Bumblebee, and many others are back and instantly recognizable. The distinctive cartoon transformation sound is there. Graphically, the cel-shaded presentation is perfect, and very, very Generation One. But beyond that, it's actually a very enjoyable game. The combat mechanics are extremely well done. Transforming mid-fight is often a necessity and seamlessly woven into combos, making it quite unlike High Moon's excellent War for/Fall of Cybertron games. Another distinction is the strong focus on melee combat, but some enemies (e.g., Seekers) require switching to a ranged blaster."
108,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"I downloaded the game and played it for a little while, and it was nothing special. I spent more time trying to log in than actually playing. There's a bug where it says there's an update to the terms of service, and whenever you click 'accept,' it just pops up again. You have to restart the client for it to work. That isn't so bad, but why do I need to link my Steam and Gface accounts? They say it's for DLC, but why is that necessary? It's also not reversible, so now I know that a company I don't care about has access to my Steam information. The game itself is mediocre. It's easily recognizable as a COD clone, except somehow they made the gunplay worse... How is that even possible?"

In my opinion, this is a truly great and fun game, although the format may be somewhat annoying (where the free-roam city area repopulates with new enemies every time you progress the story). I particularly enjoyed the 'dual play' segments (where you can play Batman and one more character), and the ability to use the controller for most parts of the game, while the mouse and keyboard for the tank combat segments was greatly appreciated. Driving your Batmobile around the free-roam city, including while chasing the APC commanders, is actually quite enjoyable once you figure out how to use the brakes to skid around corners (and when you master that, navigating the city is really quite enjoyable!)."

It looks, sounds, and plays excellently, with great FPS mechanics, an engaging story, captivating characters, flawless voice acting, and an amazing soundtrack. Not for the fainthearted, though; some of those cutscenes were quite intense and vivid. However, when a game is this good, the flaws become more noticeable, and here they are as I saw them: no SLI support—unbelievable! I had to set the game aside until I upgraded my card, as it ran too poorly on my old dual-GPU GTX 590. Ensure you have a decent single GPU card. Also, annoyingly small obstacles are often unclimbable."

I can’t tell you how many times I hear new players complain about getting killed really fast. Oh, forbid you get shot in the face and die. It's not like that doesn’t happen in real life or anything.

But the best thing about this game beyond all that is the comedy. If you've played any RPG since the dawn of video game RPGs, you will laugh at the various jokes, parodies, and references; if you've never played an RPG before, you'll still enjoy the game for its humor. If you played Final Fantasy VII or X, you absolutely need to play this game. Without giving too much away, I had to actually stop playing after 2 hours to give my cheeks a break from laughing and smiling so much. What a delight so far!"

The description sounded perfect for me, but the execution has done nothing for me. I love puzzle and exploration games, but I found this game completely unintuitive, and even after looking up how to progress, I still simply didn't find the gameplay itself fun. It also completely lacks a pause button, or if it does have one, I never found it. Considering that many sequences in the game are timed, this seems like a critical oversight. I also feel like this game is more cut scene than an actual game, and I end up just sitting around drumming my fingers a lot."

My gut churned the whole time, but I persevered for Uncle Fred! If you guys made a DLC or second game, I would be the first to buy it and recommend it to everyone I know.

In previous games, you were set on Earth's timeline, going through periods like the Stone Age, Medieval Age, and Modern Age; however, in this game, you are set in the future on a mission to colonize a new planet. What I enjoy about this game is that 2K took a new approach and added some exciting mechanics such as the affinity system and orbital layer. What I didn't enjoy was that these new mechanics could make the game overwhelming at times. What I think could be improved is incorporating new artwork into the game, such as the environment you experience when communicating with another leader."
118,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"Great game! Tons of replayability and a very fun zombie survival game! Definitely in my top 5 zombie games ever played. Edit: After playing 60+ hours, I can honestly say this is one of the better, more ""realistic"" zombie games. It’s very much designed like a survival horror as you must conserve your ammo, heal your wounds when you bleed out, take pills when you're infected, etc. Also, I find the zombies to be well-animated and quite natural for a free-to-play game. P.S.: I would recommend getting 1 or 2 friends to play with, but the community is super friendly, and you can usually make friends or chat with people in the chat or over voice comms."
119,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"02/07/2014 - It's unfortunate I can't fully recommend or enjoy this game. From the short time I've played, I know I'd be hooked if it weren't for the following two game breakers. No Aussie servers: one red bar puts you at a severe disadvantage and creates unbearable lag. Even offline training mode was stuttering and lagging (how does that even happen?). Combine that with the poor ping, and it just ruins the experience. Everything artifacts like crazy—the menus, backgrounds, training, and in-game. I've never had this happen before with this card and thought it might not like my OC. Set my GPU back to stock and, sure enough, it didn't make a difference."
120,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"Very late last night, I finished this. The story isn't very deep or interesting, but what makes it stand out is the storytelling. The atmosphere is full to the brim, and the many collectibles do a great job of fleshing it out. I learned a lot about the world of Batman, so it was a bit disappointing that so few bosses were in the game. Oh well, there are enough future games to rectify that. The combat is the right amount of challenge, but it's more on the easy side. Leveling up Batman wasn't very satisfying. It's the gadgets you upgrade and acquire during the campaign that add nice new gameplay mechanics. Gaining access to previously unreachable places offers a nice sense of progression."
121,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"'To the Moon' is no mere game... Nay, it is a veritable experience, and one of the best of my life at that. Think Telltale's 'The Walking Dead' is sad? Hohoho! Well, it's no match for 'To the Moon'! Never before have I been so depressed yet fulfilled by something purely fictional. This masterpiece represents the pinnacle of storytelling, in my opinion, and the soundtrack is a gorgeously charming and perfect accompaniment. Yes, the controls are a bit finicky and the gameplay is not the strong point, but the story is so fantastic that I did not care one bit. Plus, the humor of the game is great as well and it does not intrude upon the distinguished nature of the story... And the 'Doctor Who' references are endless."
122,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"Bastion is a brilliantly crafted game with a compelling storyline. Set in the aftermath of a calamity, you start rebuilding on the bastion. There’s a significant amount of choice in the game, including what to build to gain an advantage, which weapons to use, and which power-ups to enhance those weapons, as well as which drinks to use for a bonus effect. The art style and music in the game are fantastic, and everything looks vibrant; who says the apocalypse has to be dull? Best of all, the game features narration based on your actions. So if you pick up a weapon and then switch it for another in the armory, the narration reflects your choice, commenting on your selection of the new weapon."
123,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"I originally bought this game during its early development, when the only currency was spacebux, and there was no 'tech tree'. This was when the game was great. All the guns were equally overpowered, so there were no issues with imbalance; everyone could eliminate anyone at any time. Additionally, the game used to offer unlimited gun slots and five loadouts. You would think that for a game boasting 'bajillions of guns', they would at least provide more than 6 weapon slots and 3 loadouts before you have to pay for additional ones. At one point, I had about 3 pages of guns and was planning new ideas for more because, personally, that's where I found the fun."
124,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"This game was a surprising gem. One often sees rave reviews of certain products that are often misleading. In this case, the reviews reflect the fun of this neat little game. It is an intriguing mix between a classic 2D platformer and a MOBA, and does it with style. I found myself enjoying characters that I wouldn't enjoy in other MOBA games. I had expected this trend to continue, but decided to give a melee tank a try anyway. I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome and ended up trying out more as they were unlocked from playing games. The art style and interface are surprisingly charming. As such, I now use one of the characters as my avatar and a wallpaper from creating a card set for the game."

It's been a while since a game had that effect on me. The music sets the mood, the sound effects are spot on, and the controls are perfect. I look forward to every battle, and they've optimized combat extremely well. I had my doubts about the naval combat system, but it's so much fun to lay waste to multiple fleets! The only way to lose in this game is to fail to retreat. If the combat looks overwhelming, just get out of there, regroup, and counter-assault. Thanks, devs, for an awesome experience!"

While fans of the original series may be upset by the change to their beloved character, it’s certainly for the better; and this new game by Ninja Theory proves it. DMC serves as the perfect point for newcomers to jump into the series. It shows the origins of an arrogant, cynical Dante and chronicles his journey from cynicism to selflessness. Throughout, the game weaves a clear narrative arc for the new Dante, making him a compelling character to watch.

It has so much detail put into it and is a bundle of happiness, bad puns, annoying dogs, and secrets. It is serious when it needs to be but isn't a stranger to funny moments. The character design is on point, with various characters possessing different personalities and secrets. It stands out from other RPGs because you don't have to kill anyone, which is an uncommon concept in RPGs. With lots of inspiration from EarthBound, one of the best RPGs I've seen, you can tell that it is going to be good. It easily has the best soundtrack I've heard in ages."
128,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"I am recommending this solely because it's free and might be a more 'enjoyable' experience for others. As for my experience, the 'game' did nothing for me. Half the story relies on shock factor. I was neither shocked nor emotionally moved in any way. Maybe I'm desensitized, or maybe it was too simple to warrant a reaction from me. As for the other half of the game, it tries to paint a picture (literally) of a person in mental decline. It deals with obsession, hallucination, depression, and a few other things. In theory, it is a cool idea. But the 'game' took me 10 minutes to complete, and that is with reading and absorbing every little bit of information I could."

It is an excellent way to challenge your mind while staying entertaining. Although this game isn't as story-heavy, it led to the creation of one of the most popular games of 2011. I still play this game and complete it when I feel bored, and I love returning to see what birthed a legend. Gameplay: Portal's gameplay is quite simple, at least to explain. You use portals to your advantage, along with buttons that activate a part of the puzzle. Two types of buttons are in the game: one that you press and one that requires a cube to activate."

Divinity: Dragon Commander reaches very close to these borders of my personal favorite RTS game. Combine this with a substantial risk-like grand strategy mode, and there, it hits the spot. I try not to be overly biased due to the fact that this game allows you to turn into a dragon, aiding your troops by supporting, attacking, and even commanding unit production, direction, and spawning at the same time. Honestly, I do prefer the complex RTS games nowadays. Think of Civ V and so on. However, such games attempt to cram complex mechanics, charts, and resources all into one complicated game mode."

And all of this without mentioning the world, characters, story, or gameplay... I could write entire pages about it. But instead, I'll just say this: if you like RPGs, play this game.

When I played versions 1.00 to 1.03, my game never crashed, and I didn’t see any bugs. I have noticed that after the 1.03 patch, the drawing distance sometimes is terrible, starting to draw objects only when you're really close, sometimes even people. However, ignoring these bugs, crashes, and draw-distance issues, this is a truly fantastic game. They put a huge effort into the quests, with some being really emotional and deep, lots of side quests, and the fact that your decisions affect a lot in this game.

There is a fairly steep learning curve to the game's mechanics, which I am still trying to learn; however, this breadth of strategy allows you numerous ways to reach goals and take advantage of certain situations. The game, in my mind, is almost infinitely replayable. I find myself immersed in every session I play, regardless of how the playthrough is going."

After those few enjoyable hours, you'll begin to see that the only thing the game offers is repetition in its combat, enemies, and gameplay. The one major high point is that the developers work hard and do semi-frequent updates, generally including much content, from sweeping changes to some of the game's systems, new warframes, and other tweaks/features. It's a good game to play casually, though I doubt it will hold your attention beyond a few months unless you really enjoy grinding. The upside to all of this is that the game is free, so I'd recommend trying it out. If you're looking for a quick fix, try it out."

Sadly, it’s far from it. In this game, you go about absorbing increasingly larger objects to grow bigger and absorb even larger items. Yet, the gameplay isn’t as smooth as it could be, the levels lack inventiveness, and what’s present is a surreal horror show. I don’t mean an entertaining horror show but one that leaves you rather depressed and questioning if being alive is all it should be.

The game starts you off by asking you to pick a side: Republican or Democrat—there is no independent or third party option. A little disappointed but still optimistic, I carried on to see what I could do. I will give the game credit: the character customization, although limited, is pretty fun to explore.

My Pip-Boy disappeared permanently at one point, requiring me to research console commands to restore it. You don't have to work for power armor; it's essentially given to you at the beginning of the game, and power cores are readily available in trader shops. The value of power armor is greatly diminished compared to previous Fallout games. The story is mediocre, and everything about this game is unremarkable, except it doesn't crash every 10 minutes like Fallout 3. It is much more stable compared to Fallout 3.

For one thing, I have a Vive and I'm much more interested in playing room-scale games with the controllers. Beyond that, the game is initially awe-inspiring in the scale of its universe, but I also felt that same scale was a hindrance to my enjoyment. The learning curve and the amount of time needed to do anything interesting at the beginning were both too large for me.

Single hits to the chest, neck, or head from rifle-caliber weapons almost always result in death unless they just graze you. Rounds drop over distance, and short, controlled bursts are required if you wish to remain on target. There is no magical ammunition pool. If you reload halfway through your magazine all the time, then you will have a pouch full of half-full mags. You can't run forever. If you sprint for a while, your aim will suffer as you gasp heavily until you've caught your breath. Rest your weapon on your elbows while prone or on a window sill to steady your aim.

The game plays well for me on medium, and I am running a GTX 560 with 2 GB of VRAM. Initially, the game set itself to high, and it ran a bit sluggishly but not to the point of being unplayable.

The number of women purchasing programs to protect PCs from virus, spam, and spyware attacks rose by 11.2% each year from 2002 to 2004. The study, conducted for net security firm Preventon, shows that security messages are reaching a wider range of users. It is thought that 40% of those buying home net security programs are retired. For the last three years, this percentage has increased by an average of 13.2%. Notably, more retired women (53%) were buying security software than retired men. The research reflects the changing demographics of web users and the growing awareness of the greater risks that high-speed broadband connections can pose to users."

But more and more iPod owners are filling that space with audio content created by a diverse assortment of producers. This is called ""podcasting,"" and its strongest proponent is former MTV host and VJ (video jockey) Adam Curry. Podcasting takes its name from the Apple iPod, although you do not need an iPod to create or to listen to a podcast. A podcast is essentially an internet-based radio show that podcasters create, usually in the comfort of their own home. They need only a microphone, a PC, and some editing software. They then upload their shows to the internet, and others can download and listen to them, all for free."

In addition to coaxing ever larger and more tangible objects into a regime of quantum behavior, this new capability has fostered ideas of using mechanical oscillators in the processing and communication of quantum information and as precision force sensors operating beyond the standard quantum limit. However, the effectively linear interaction between motion and light or electricity precludes access to the broader class of quantum states of motion, such as cat states or energy squeezed states. Indeed, early optomechanical proposals noted the potential to escape this restriction by creating strong quadratic coupling of motion to light.

Spamming strategies are challenging to capture, as they can change rapidly over time, vary among spammers and target products, and, more critically, remain unknown in most cases. Furthermore, most existing detectors focus on detection accuracy, which is not aligned with the goal of maintaining the trustworthiness of product evaluations. To address these challenges, we formulate a minimax game where the spammers and spam detectors compete based on practical goals that are not solely focused on detection accuracy.

Among this family, we identify a tracking solution with a single parameter to simultaneously control the fidelity of the transfer, the population of the excited state, and robustness. We define a measure of the robustness of an uh-fidelity transfer as the minimum percentile deviation on the pulse areas at which the infidelity rises above $10^{-4}$. The robustness of our shaped pulses is found superior to that of Gaussian and adiabatically-optimized pulses for moderate pulse areas."

We demonstrate that all local minima share the same structural form that partially identifies the component centers of the true mixture, in the sense that each local minimum involves a non-overlapping combination of fitting multiple Gaussians to a single true component and fitting a single Gaussian to multiple components. Our results apply to the setting where the true mixture components satisfy a certain separation condition and remain valid even when the number of components is over- or under-specified. For Gaussian mixtures with three components, we obtain sharper results concerning the scaling with the separation between components."

In practice, due to the exponentially increasing Hilbert space dimension concerning the system size, it is very challenging to construct an efficient entanglement witness for general multipartite entangled states. For $n$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-like states, the most robust witness scheme requires $n+1$ local measurement settings and can tolerate up to $1/2$ white noise. In comparison, the most efficient witness for GHZ-like states only requires two local measurement settings and can tolerate up to $1/3$ white noise."

We develop a comprehensive method to extract the multipole moments of arbitrary stationary spacetimes and apply it to a significant family of horizonless microstate geometries. The latter can break the axial and equatorial symmetry of the Kerr metric and exhibit a much richer multipolar structure, providing a gateway to constrain fuzzball models phenomenologically. We find numerical evidence that all multipole moments are typically larger (in absolute value) than those of a Kerr black hole with the same mass and spin. Current measurements of the quadrupole moment of black-hole candidates could impose only mild constraints on fuzzballs, while future gravitational-wave detections of extreme mass-ratio inspirals with the space mission LISA will substantially improve these bounds."

We examine a common scenario where edges can be short-term interactions (e.g., messaging) or long-term structural connections (e.g., friendship). In practice, long-term edges are often specified by humans. Human-specified edges can be both costly to produce and suboptimal for the downstream task. To address these issues, we propose a model based on temporal point processes and variational autoencoders that learns to infer temporal attention between nodes by observing node communication. As temporal attention drives between-node feature propagation, using the dynamics of node interactions to learn this key component provides more flexibility while simultaneously avoiding problems associated with human-specified edges."

The equivariant stable homotopy groups of every global spectrum form a global Mackey functor, so the splittings imply that certain long exact homotopy group sequences decompose into short exact sequences.

The poorly constrained shape and amplitude of this suppression are significant sources of uncertainties for upcoming cosmological weak lensing surveys such as Euclid or LSST. In this first paper in a series of two, we use simulations to create a Euclid-like tomographic mock data set for the cosmic shear power spectrum and the corresponding covariance matrix, which are both corrected for baryonic effects following the baryonification method of Schneider et al. (2019). Furthermore, we develop an emulator to achieve rapid predictions of the baryonic power suppression, enabling us to conduct a likelihood inference analysis for a standard $\lambda$CDM cosmology with both cosmological and astrophysical parameters."
213,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"Spontaneous conversations in real-world settings, such as those in child-centered recordings, are among the most challenging audio files to process. Nevertheless, developing speech processing models that handle such a wide variety of conditions would be particularly useful for language acquisition studies, where researchers are interested in the quantity and quality of the speech that children hear and produce, as well as for early diagnosis and evaluating remediation effects. In this paper, we present our approach to designing an open-source neural network to classify audio segments into vocalizations produced by the child wearing the recording device, vocalizations produced by other children, adult male speech, and adult female speech. To this end, we gathered diverse child-centered corpora totaling 260 hours of recordings and covering 10 languages."
214,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"Density-based clustering is based on linking groups to specific features of the probability distribution underlying the data. Referring to a true, yet unknown, population structure allows the clustering problem to be framed in a standard inferential setting, where ideal population clustering is defined by the partition induced by the true density function. The nonparametric approach, known as modal clustering, aligns the groups with the domains of attraction of the density modes. Operationally, a nonparametric density estimate is required, and selecting the appropriate amount of smoothing, which governs the shape of the density and thus potentially the modal structure, is crucial to identify the final partition. This work addresses the issue of density estimation for modal clustering from an asymptotic perspective."
215,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"The tails of diboson production at the LHC are sensitive to the interference between the Standard Model and higher dimension operators parameterizing the effects of heavy new physics. However, helicity selection rules for the diboson scattering amplitudes create an obstruction to the naive interference contributions of dimension six operators, causing the leading contributions to the total diboson rate correction to cancel. In this case, carefully measuring the azimuthal decay angles ""resurrects"" the interference, recouping sensitivity to the ""non-interfering"" operators. We explore these signatures in detail and find that the EFT uncertainties associated with higher-dimensional operators are uniquely well-suppressed by constructing an asymmetry variable, generated only by these non-interfering operators, relegating the effects of higher-dimensional, interfering operators to the same status as statistical errors in this observable."
216,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"Causal inference from observational data is the aim of many data analyses in the health and social sciences. However, academic statistics has often disapproved of data analyses with a causal objective. The introduction of the term ""data science"" provides a historic opportunity to redefine data analysis in a way that naturally accommodates causal inference from observational data. Like others before, we organize the scientific contributions of data science into three task classes: description, prediction, and counterfactual prediction (which includes causal inference). An explicit classification of data science tasks is necessary to discuss the data, assumptions, and analytics required to accomplish each task successfully. We argue that a failure to adequately describe the role of subject-matter expert knowledge in data analysis is a source of widespread misunderstandings about data science."
217,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"The weak gravity conjecture (WGC) demands the existence of superextremal particles in any consistent quantum theory of gravity. The standard belief is that these particles are introduced to ensure that extremal black holes are either unstable or marginally stable, but it is not clear what is wrong if this doesn't happen. This note shows that, for a generic Einstein quantum theory of gravity in AdS, the stability of extremal black branes is in tension with rigorously proven quantum information theorems about entanglement entropy. Avoiding the contradiction leads to a nonperturbative version of the WGC, which reduces to the usual statement at weak coupling. The argument is general, and it does not rely on either supersymmetry or a particular UV completion, assuming only the validity of Einsteinian gravity, effective field theory, and holography."
218,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"Understanding how strongly correlated two-dimensional (2D) systems can give rise to unconventional superconductivity with high critical temperatures is one of the major unsolved problems in condensed matter physics. Ultracold 2D Fermi gases have emerged as clean and controllable model systems to study the interplay of strong correlations and reduced dimensionality, but direct evidence of superfluidity in these systems has been missing. Here, we demonstrate superfluidity in an ultracold 2D Fermi gas by moving a periodic potential through the system and observing no dissipation below a critical velocity v$_{\rm c}$. We measure v$_{\rm c}$ as a function of interaction strength and find a maximum in the crossover regime between bosonic and fermionic superfluidity. Our measurement establishes ultracold Fermi gases as a powerful tool for studying the influence of reduced dimensionality on strongly correlated superfluids."
219,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"An ordinary differential equation (ODE) is a mathematical model used in many applications such as climatology, bioinformatics, and chemical engineering with its intuitive appeal to modeling. Despite ODE's wide usage in modeling, their frequent lack of analytic solutions makes it difficult to estimate ODE parameters from data, especially when the model has many variables and parameters. This paper proposes a Bayesian ODE parameter estimating algorithm that is fast and accurate even for models with many parameters. The proposed method approximates an ODE model with a state-space model based on equations of a numeric solver. It allows fast estimation by avoiding computations of a complete numerical solution in the likelihood. The posterior is obtained by a variational Bayes method, more specifically, the approximate Riemannian conjugate gradient method (Honkela et al.)."

We find that the differential conductance and induced pairing amplitudes strongly depend on the angle between the junction direction in real space and the axis separating the Weyl nodes in momentum space. We identify the influence of a chiral chemical potential, i.e., the electron population imbalance between Weyl nodes of opposite chirality, on the transport characteristics of the junction. Remarkably, we observe a net spin polarization of Cooper pairs that are generated via Andreev reflection in the two WSM regions. The spin polarization is opposite in the two WSM regions and highly sensitive to the chirality imbalance and excitation energy."
221,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"Metal ion implantation into ceramics has been demonstrated to be an effective and controllable technique for tailoring the surface electrical conductivity of the ceramic piece, and this approach has been used in numerous applications. Importantly, it provides a method for grading the voltage drop across high voltage insulators, thereby increasing the maximum operational voltage that can be applied to the insulator without surface flashover. However, a concern for using the method is the long-term stability of the implantation-induced conductivity, especially if the implanted metal species is readily oxidized. Here, we report on our examination of the long-term behavior of the surface conductivity of titanium-implanted alumina. The results indicate that, after an initial drop of as much as 40% in the first few weeks following implantation, the conductivity shows only a very slow decrease of about 10% over the following year."
222,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"We introduce a novel Skyrme-like conserved current in the effective theory of pions and vector mesons based on the concept of hidden local symmetry. The associated charge corresponds to the skyrmion charge for any smooth configuration. Furthermore, there exist singular configurations that can be identified as \(n_f=1\) baryons charged under the new symmetry. Under this identification, the vector mesons act as Chern-Simons vector fields residing on the quantum Hall droplet that forms the \(n_f=1\) baryon. We propose this current as the correct effective expression for the baryon current at low energies. This proposal offers a unified viewpoint for the two types of baryons and permits them to transform continuously from one to the other naturally. Additionally, Chern-Simons dualities on the droplet can be interpreted as resulting from a Seiberg-like duality between gluons and vector mesons."
223,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"Interfacial spin-orbit coupling in Josephson junctions offers an intriguing way to combine anomalous Hall and Josephson physics in a single device. We theoretically study how the superposition of both effects impacts superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator/superconductor junctions' transport properties. Transverse momentum-dependent skew tunneling of Cooper pairs through the spin-active ferromagnetic insulator interface creates sizable transverse Hall supercurrents, which we refer to as anomalous Josephson Hall effect currents. We generalize the Furusaki-Tsukada formula, initially established to quantify usual (tunneling) Josephson current flows, to evaluate the transverse current components and demonstrate that their amplitudes are widely adjustable by means of spin-orbit coupling strengths or the superconducting phase difference across the junction. As a clear spectroscopic fingerprint of Josephson junctions, well-localized subgap bound states form around the interface."
224,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"Following the suggestions from the Monte Carlo experiments in Jiménez, J. of Turbul. (2020), that dipoles are as essential to the dynamics of decaying two-dimensional turbulence as individual vortex cores, it is found that the kinetic energy of this flow is carried by elongated streams formed through the concatenation of dipoles. Vortices divide into a group of small, fast-moving cores, and another group of larger, slowly moving ones, which can be described as 'frozen' into a slowly evolving 'crystal'. The kinematics of both groups are quite different, and only the former is self-similar. The latter is responsible for most of the kinetic energy of the flow, and its vortices form the dipoles and the streams. Mechanisms are discussed for the growth of this slow component."

Often, the running time of quantum algorithms in this framework is characterized by the quantum hitting time: the time required for the quantum walk to find a vertex of interest with high probability. In this article, we provide improved upper bounds for the quantum hitting time that can be applied to several CTQW-based quantum algorithms. Specifically, we apply our techniques to the glued-trees problem, improving the hitting time upper bound by a polynomial factor: from $o(n^5)$ to $o(n^2\log n)$. Furthermore, our methods also help to exponentially improve the dependence on precision of the continuous-time quantum walk based algorithm to find a marked node on any ergodic, reversible Markov chain by Chakraborty et al."

Dry (or the ""loss-cone"") EMRIs, previously considered the main EMRI sources for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, are primarily produced by multi-body scattering in the nuclear star cluster and gravitational capture. In this letter, we highlight an alternative EMRI formation channel: (wet) EMRI formation assisted by the accretion flow around accreting galactic-center massive black holes (MBHs). In this channel, the accretion disk captures stellar-mass black holes that are initially moving on inclined orbits, and subsequently drives them to migrate towards the MBH—a process that boosts the formation rate of EMRIs in such galaxies by orders of magnitude."

In such cases, we still expect our recommender systems to attract users initially so that they choose to stay and become active participants. This problem falls into the new user cold-start category and is crucial to a company's development and even survival. Existing solutions for user cold-start recommendations often require additional user efforts, such as setting up an interview, or rely on side information like user demographics, locations, and social relations. However, users may not be willing to participate in interviews, and side information on cold-start users is often unavailable."

It has also been successfully applied in wireless communications, even though current radio systems are well-understood and optimal algorithms exist for many tasks. While some gains have been achieved by learning individual parts of a receiver, a better approach is to jointly learn the entire receiver. This, however, often results in a challenging nonlinear problem, for which the optimal solution is infeasible to implement. To address this, we propose a deep fully convolutional neural network, deeprx, which executes the complete receiver pipeline from frequency domain signal stream to uncoded bits in a 5G-compliant fashion. We ensure accurate channel estimation by structuring the input of the convolutional neural network in a highly specific manner using both the data and pilot symbols."
229,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"Mutation-based fuzzing typically starts with an initial set of non-crashing seed inputs (a corpus) from which to generate new inputs through mutation. A corpus of potential seeds often contains thousands of similar inputs. This lack of diversity can lead to wasted fuzzing effort due to exhaustive mutation from all available seeds. To address this, fuzzers come with distillation tools (e.g., afl-cmin) that select the smallest subset of seeds that trigger the same range of instrumentation data points as the full corpus. Common practice suggests that reducing the number and cumulative size of the seeds results in more efficient fuzzing, which we explore systematically. We present results from over 34 CPU-years of fuzzing with five distillation approaches to understand their impact on finding bugs in real-world software."

The agents can be divided into several groups, wherein the agents have similar (isomorphic) state transition structures and can be relabeled into the same template. Based on the template, a scalable supervisor with a state size and computational cost independent of the number of agents is designed for the case of partial observation. The scalable supervisor under partial observation does not need to be recomputed, regardless of how many agents are added or removed from the system. We generalize our earlier results to partial observation by proposing sufficient conditions for safety and maximal permissiveness of the scalable least restrictive supervisor on the template level. An example is provided to illustrate the proposed scalable supervisory synthesis."

An efficient approach for ENF estimation is introduced with temporal windowing, utilizing the filter-bank Capon spectral estimator. A form of Gohberg-Semencul factorization of the model covariance matrix is applied due to the Toeplitz structure of the covariance matrix. Moreover, this approach employs, for the first time in the field of ENF, a temporal window, which is not necessarily rectangular, before spectral estimation. Krylov matrices are utilized for fast matrix inversion. The proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in ENF estimation when a short time window of one second is used in power recordings. In speech recordings, the proposed approach provides highly accurate results regarding both time complexity and accuracy."

It increased the nonlinearity of the fluorescence emission and changed the spatial frequency distribution of the fluorescence image. We used a differential excitation protocol to extract high spatial frequency information. By modulating the excitation laser's power, the spatial resolution of imaging improved approximately 1.6 times compared to confocal microscopy. Due to the simplicity of the experimental setup and data processing, we expect this method can be used to improve the spatial resolution of sensing and biological labeling with defects in solids."
234,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"When random effects are correlated with sample design variables, the usual approach of employing individual survey weights (constructed to be inversely proportional to unit survey inclusion probabilities) to form a pseudo-likelihood no longer results in asymptotically unbiased inference. We construct a weight-exponentiated formulation of the random effects distribution that achieves unbiased inference for generating hyperparameters of the random effects. We compare our approach with frequentist methods reliant on numerical integration to show that only the Bayesian method achieves both unbiased estimation with respect to the sampling design distribution and consistency concerning the population generating distribution. Our simulations and real data example from a survey of business establishments demonstrate the utility of our approach across different modeling formulations and sampling designs.

These main processes replace each other over a temperature range of about fifty degrees. Dielectric spectroscopy also enabled the distinction of two processes of orientational relaxation: the first due to the rotation of the side mesogenic groups, and the second associated with the motion of the main chain segments."

However, this approach may cause more hash bits to get stuck in the wrong saturated areas of activation functions, unable to escape. We refer to this issue as the ""dead bits problem~(dbp)"". Additionally, existing quantization loss can exacerbate dbp. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective gradient amplifier that acts before activation functions to alleviate dbp."

The standard scenario posits an initially circular and narrow belt of planetesimals at semi-major axis $a$, whose eccentricity is increased to $e_f$ after the gas disc has dispersed by secular perturbations from an eccentric planet, resulting in a belt width of $2ae_f$. In a minor modification of this scenario, narrower belts can arise if the planetesimals are initially eccentric, which could result from earlier planet perturbations during the gas-rich protoplanetary disc phase. However, a primordial eccentricity could alternatively result from instabilities that increase the disc eccentricity, without requiring any planets."

Here, we report on measurements of many-body modes in 1D gated-wires using a tunneling spectroscopy technique. We observe two separate Fermi seas at high energies, associated with spin and charge excitations, together with the emergence of three additional 1D 'replica' modes that strengthen with decreasing wire length.

To this end, we combined the kinematic information provided by Gaia for almost all galactic clusters with the largest sample of cluster ages available after carefully correcting for systematic errors.

We analytically demonstrate that the few-get-richer effect arises when users tend to click on top-ranked items and exhibit heterogeneous preferences for item classes.

With carefully designed patterns, the proposed pruning consistently achieves unprecedented accuracy enhancement and better feature extraction ability across different dnn structures and datasets. Moreover, our pattern-aware pruning framework achieves pattern library extraction, pattern selection, pattern and connectivity pruning, and weight training simultaneously.

Understanding all of this enables us to shift our perception of seafood away from a commodity to an opportunity to restore our ecosystem. It allows us to celebrate the seafood that we're so fortunate to eat. So what do we call this? I think we call it restorative seafood. Where sustainability is the capacity to endure and maintain, restorative is the ability to replenish and progress."

The stone-hearted miser plagued by the ghost of Christmas Past. More than a century after his death, these remain recognizable figures from the work of Charles Dickens. So striking is his body of work that it gave rise to its own adjective. But what are the features of Dickens's writing that make it so special? Dickens’s fiction brims with anticipation through brooding settings, plot twists, and mysteries. These aspects of his work kept his audience wanting more. When first published, his stories were serialized, meaning they were released a few chapters at a time in affordable literary journals and only later reprinted as books."

This technology involves simulating humans with a virtual body and a simulated nervous system for controlling that body. Before I delve further into this technology, let's quickly examine the current portrayal of human characters in computer games. Here is a clip from the game ""Grand Theft Auto 3."" We briefly looked at it yesterday, and you can see—it's actually a very impressive game. It's one of the most successful games of all time."

We watched these incredible athletes, witnessing amazing goals and clean, engaging games. Meanwhile, off the field, these women were advocating for equal pay, and in some countries, any pay at all for their sport. Our curiosity led us to watch the games live, and we decided that one of the Spanish-speaking networks in the US was the ideal choice for us. However, it wasn't until a few games into the tournament that a friend remarked to me, ""Why does it seem like everything I'm seeing is commercials for makeup, household cleaning products, and diets?"

Now, I want to tell you about the Yap because their form of money is fascinating. They used these limestone discs called rai stones. The Yap don't actually move these rai stones around or exchange them the way we do with our coins because rai stones can become quite massive. The largest is about four tons and 12 feet across. So the Yap simply keep track of ownership of each stone. There's a story about sailors who were transporting a stone across the ocean when they encountered trouble, and the stone actually fell in."
261,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,speech,"You've been accused of a crime you did not commit. It’s impossible to prove your innocence. If you insist you’re innocent anyway, you’ll likely be found guilty and executed. But if you confess, apologize, and implicate others for good measure, you’ll go free. Do you give a false confession—or risk a public hanging? This was the choice facing those accused of witchcraft in the village of Salem, Massachusetts, between February 1692 and May 1693. They were the victims of paranoia about the supernatural, misdirected religious fervor—and a justice system that valued repentance over truth. Salem was settled in 1626 by Puritans, a group of English Protestants. Life was strict and isolated for the people of Salem. Battles with their Native American neighbors and groups of French settlers were commonplace."
262,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,speech,"There are currently hundreds of thousands of people on transplant lists, waiting for critical organs like kidneys, hearts, and livers that could save their lives. Unfortunately, there aren’t nearly enough donor organs available to meet that demand. What if, instead of waiting, we could create brand-new, customized organs from scratch? That’s the idea behind bioprinting, a branch of regenerative medicine currently under development. We’re not able to print complex organs just yet, but simpler tissues, including blood vessels and tubes responsible for nutrient and waste exchange, are already within our reach. Bioprinting is a biological cousin of 3D printing, a technique that deposits layers of material on top of each other to construct a three-dimensional object one slice at a time."

I'll try to speak a bit today about a phenomenon which can, and indeed is, changing the world, and whose name is People Power. I'll start with an anecdote, or for those of you who are Monty Python lovers, a Monty Python type of sketch. Here it is. It is December 15, 2010. Someone gives you a bet: you will look at a crystal ball, and you will see the future; the future will be accurate. But you need to share it with the world. Okay, curiosity killed the cat, you take the bet, you look at the crystal ball. One hour later, you're sitting in a building of the national TV, in a top show, and you tell the story."

He's been named the voice of a generation, and he's creating classic songs at a seemingly impossible rate, but there's a small minority of dissenters, claiming that Dylan is stealing other people's songs. Fast forward to 2004. Brian Burton, aka Danger Mouse, takes the Beatles' ""White Album,"" combines it with Jay-Z's ""The Black Album,"" and creates ""The Grey Album."" ""The Grey Album"" becomes an immediate sensation online, and the Beatles' record company sends out numerous cease-and-desist letters for ""unfair competition and dilution of our valuable property."" Now, ""The Grey Album"" is a remix."
265,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,speech,"Well, that's kind of an obvious statement up there. I began with that sentence about 12 years ago, initially focusing on developing countries, but you're sitting here from every corner of the world. If you envision a map of your country, I think you'll notice that for every nation on earth, you could draw small circles to indicate, ""these are places where good teachers won't go."" Moreover, those are the places from where trouble often arises. So we have an ironic problem — good teachers don't want to go to just those areas where they're needed the most. I started in 1999 to try and address this issue with an experiment, which was a very simple experiment in New Delhi."
266,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,speech,"Currently, most refugees live in cities rather than in refugee camps. They represent over 60 percent of the global refugee population. With the majority living in urban areas, there is a strong need for a paradigm shift and new approaches. Instead of wasting money on building walls, it would be better to invest in programs that enable refugees to help themselves. We always have to leave behind all our possessions, but not our skills and knowledge. If allowed to live productive lives, refugees can support themselves and contribute to the development of their host country.

267,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,speech,"I have two questions for you. First: whose shoulders do you stand on? Second: what do you stand for? These are questions that I always begin my poetry workshops with because, at times, poetry can seem like a dead art form for old white men, who seem like they were born to be old, like, you know, Benjamin Button or something. I ask my students these questions and then share how I answer them, which is in these three sentences: I am the daughter of Black writers, who are descended from freedom fighters who broke their chains and changed the world. They call me. These are words I repeat as a mantra before every poetry performance. In fact, I was doing it in the corner over there. I was making faces."

(laughter) Hello. I painted myself white one day, stood on a box, put a hat or a can at my feet, and when someone came by and dropped in money, I handed them a flower—and some intense eye contact.

269,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,speech,"On October 4, 1957, the world watched in awe and fear as the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the world's first man-made satellite, into space. This small metal ball, less than two feet in diameter, initiated a space race between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. that would last for eighteen years and change the world as we know it. Sputnik was actually not the first piece of human technology to enter space. That superlative goes to the V-2 rocket used by Germany in missile attacks against Allied cities as a last-ditch effort in the final years of World War II. It wasn't very effective, but, at the end of the war, both the U.S. and U.S.S.R. had captured the technology and scientists that had developed it and began using them for their own projects."

But why? As I speak to you right now, more than 800 million women around the world are having a period. None of us would exist without it, and yet it remains an ""embarrassing"" subject to broach. From my experience and that of the women around me, I can tell you that it's exhausting. It's exhausting to carefully take out a brown paper bag hiding a pad, stuffing it into your pocket in the middle of a class and rushing to the washroom as discreetly as possible. It's exhausting to sit through lessons and meetings pretending to be absolutely normal, while internally crying out from intense period cramps."

It stretches across northern Canada; in Labrador, it's home to the largest remaining wild caribou herd in the world, the George River caribou herd, numbering approximately 400,000 animals. Unfortunately, when I was there, I couldn't find any of them, but you have the antlers as proof. Across the boreal, we're blessed with an incredible abundance of wetlands. Wetlands globally are among the most endangered ecosystems. They're absolutely critical ecosystems; they clean air and water, sequester large amounts of greenhouse gases, and are home to a huge diversity of species."

They had no family other than each other— they didn’t even know who their parents were. One of the brothers, Deminan, looked different from the others. His skin was covered in painful scabs, and he wondered why he alone was afflicted. One day, while the supreme spirit Yaya was out in his gardens, Deminan and his brothers sneaked into Yaya’s house. After feasting and exploring, they spotted a giant gourd hanging in the corner. But as they tried to look inside the gourd, they dropped it."

I attended a career fair on campus and secured an interview with a start-up called Theranos. At the time, there wasn't much information available about the company, but what was there seemed impressive. The company aimed to create a medical device that could run a full blood panel using just a finger-stick of blood. This innovation meant avoiding the need for a large needle to draw blood, making the process less painful. Additionally, it had the potential to open doors to predictive diagnostics."

There we lived with the Inuit in a small community of 200 people, being one of three non-Inuit families. In this community, we didn't have television, computers, or even a telephone. All my time was spent outside with the Inuit, playing. The snow and the ice were my sandbox, and the Inuit were my teachers. That's where I became truly obsessed with this polar realm."

We get people for whom nothing else has worked, individuals who have fallen through other social safety nets. They can't contain them, so we must. That's our job: contain and control them. Over the years, as a prison system, as a nation, and as a society, we've become very good at that, but that shouldn't make you happy. Today we incarcerate more people per capita than any other country in the world. We have more black men in prison today than were under slavery in 1850."

In order to do that, I need to explain something about the origin of the solar system. When we go back four and a half billion years, there was a cloud of gas and dust. In the center of this cloud, our sun formed and ignited. Along with it, what we now know as planets, comets, and asteroids formed. What then happened, according to theory, is that when the earth had cooled a bit after its formation, comets massively impacted the earth and delivered water. They probably also delivered complex organic material, which may have initiated the emergence of life."

When we created this ""Build Back Better"" series, our thought was how we could address issues arising from the pandemic, imagining how to rebuild from that. However, the events of this past week, the tragic death of George Floyd, and the daily protests that followed have provided a new urgency that we simply must address. Can we build back better from this? Before we can even start to answer that question, we have to seek to understand the immensity of this moment. Whitney Pennington Rodgers: That's right, Chris."
280,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,speech,"In 1903, the President of the United States took a three-day camping trip in California’s Yosemite Valley. President Theodore Roosevelt slept in a grove of towering sequoia trees, camped in a snowstorm, and spent hours conversing around the campfire with his host and guide, conservationist John Muir. Roosevelt famously loved the outdoors, but Muir had invited him there for more than just camping: Yosemite was in peril. Though Yosemite became protected land in 1864, the valley was still at risk of overdevelopment in 1903. It was at the heart of a decades-old struggle to set aside land for both preservation and public use—two goals that were much easier said than done. The battle over Yosemite began with the 1849 Gold Rush, when miners surged west, seeking gold in the Sierra Nevada foothills."

I was a young reporter, freshly out of college. Then I got a scoop. The story was quite simple: police officers were taking bribes from hawkers on the streets. As a young reporter, I believed I should approach it differently for maximum impact. Since everybody knew it was happening, yet nothing was stopping it, I decided to act as a seller. Through this, I documented the hard evidence. The impact was significant and fantastic. This is what many call immersion journalism, or undercover journalism."

A new drug prolongs the lives of patients with a rare disease. Health headlines like these are published every day, sometimes making claims that contradict each other. There can be a disconnect between broad, attention-grabbing headlines and the often specific, incremental results of the medical research they cover. So, how can you avoid being misled by sensational headlines? The best way to assess a headline’s credibility is to look at the original research it reports on. We’ve created a hypothetical research scenario for each of these three headlines. Keep watching for the explanation of the first example, then pause at the headline to answer the question. These are simplified scenarios."

Then my mom said, ""Well, Kristen, neither of your little brothers has a birth certificate, so how do you suggest we find out when that was?"" Mind blown. Now, 20 years later, I'm still working on it. Instead of just solving the mystery of my brothers' missing birth certificates, I try to address this problem globally.

If given the choice to embrace that existence, would you? That's the question philosopher Robert Nozick posed through a thought experiment he termed the experience machine. The experiment invites us to envision a world where scientists have created a machine simulating real life while guaranteeing experiences only of pleasure, never pain. The catch? You must permanently leave reality behind, but you'll hardly notice the difference. Your experiences will be indistinguishable from reality. Life's natural ups and downs will simply be replaced with an endless series of highs. Sounds great, right?"

This occurred a couple of years ago. I was asked as a consultant to see a woman in her 70s—a retired English professor who had pancreatic cancer. I was asked to see her because she had pain, nausea, and vomiting. When I went to see her, we talked about those symptoms, and during the course of that consultation, she asked me whether I thought medical marijuana might help her.

288,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,speech,"Where does all the carbon we release go? Carbon works in a natural cycle, present in all living things: in the soil, in the oceans, in the atmosphere, and in rocks deep underground. When plants and other living things die, much of their stored carbon returns to the atmosphere until new plants grow and reabsorb it. Over millions of years, some carbon in ancient trees and sea life becomes rock, and some becomes fossil fuels: coal, oil, and natural gas. Natural events like volcanic eruptions release some carbon trapped in rock. Human activities, like burning fossil fuels, also release some of that prehistoric carbon. Today, humans release about 60 times more carbon than all the volcanoes on the planet each year."
289,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,speech,"Even nature's most unpleasant creatures hold important secrets, but who would want a swarm of cockroaches approaching them? Yet one of the greatest differences between natural and human technologies relates to robustness. Robust systems are stable in complex and new environments. Remarkably, cockroaches can self-stabilize running over rough terrain. When we put a jet pack on them, or give them a disturbance like an earthquake, we discovered that their wonderfully tuned legs allow them to self-stabilize without using any of their brainpower. They can go over complex terrain like grass, no problem, and not get destabilized. We discovered a new behavior where, because of their shape, they actually roll automatically to their side to go through this artificial test patch of grass. Robust systems can perform multiple tasks with the same structure. Here's a new behavior we've discovered."

Now organized crime has been around for a very long time, I hear you say, and these would be wise words indeed. But in the last two decades, it has experienced an unprecedented expansion, now accounting for roughly 15 percent of the world's GDP.

Sperm donors are often referred to as ""biological fathers,"" but should we really use the word ""father""? As a philosopher and social scientist, I have been studying these questions about the concept of parenthood. Today, I will share what I learned from talking to parents and children.

I see all of that and a man who spent a quarter of his life in state prison—six years, to be exact, starting as a teenager on Rikers Island for an act that nearly cost a man his life. But what got me from there to here wasn't the punishment I faced as a teenager in an adult prison or the harshness of our legal system. Instead, it was the learning environment of a classroom that introduced me to something I didn't think was possible for me or our justice system as a whole. A few weeks before my release on parole, a counselor encouraged me to enroll in a new college course offered in the prison."

And, like too many 20-somethings, I expected to solve the world's problems — more specifically, the world's water issues — with my technology. I had a lot to learn.

These vibrations travel to you, hitting your eardrums, and then your brain transforms those vibrations into thoughts. I hope. (Laughter) I hope that's happening.

There was even a recent story about scientists considering replacing rats in their experiments with politicians.
