1,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Another week just flew by. I drove past the new house yesterday, and the front window was covered in boxes. We might get the keys at closing; I am so excited. If everything goes well this week, we are set for closing a week from Wednesday. I was up until after 3:00 a.m. last night watching movies with Bethany. There's been a lot of movie-watching going on around here lately. Here's my rundown: last night we watched ""Thirteen,"" a movie every mother of a teen should see. It was better than I expected. Then we watched ""Gigli""—yes, it was just as bad as the media said it was, but we had to see for ourselves."
2,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Summer TV used to be a dead zone full of repeats, but now there are two great new shows I've been watching religiously for the past week. ""Blow Out"" presents the most flamboyant concept ever, surprisingly featuring zero visible gay people. Hairstylist Jonathan Antin wants to open a second location for his incredibly popular West Hollywood salon, this time in Beverly Hills. Normally, no one would care—certainly not me—but while flipping through the channels, I caught a glimpse of Jonathan, equally narcissistic and dull, looking at an empty space on Rodeo Drive, saying in a big public voice, ""I am going to build here the greatest salon in the history of the world ever!"" and I was hooked. Not since ""Rocco"" have I found such a moron to be so compelling to watch on TV."

When I move my arm too much, especially while using a mouse on a computer, it’s incredibly painful. I can’t move it much now because I went on a spree updating my website and working on other online projects. I can barely muster the strength to draw anything. Lack of sleep adds to my discomfort. I'm not too happy at the moment, but I’ll get better. My mom’s surgery went okay. Her eyesight has recovered slightly—she can see fuzzy shapes and distinguish colors. Other than that, she’s still as blind as ever. Hopefully, she’ll fully regain her vision soon."
4,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Kindness of strangers... Attempted laundry today with the kids in tow and realized how quickly the simplest things can become an ordeal. I also learned how remarkably sweet total strangers can be, simply because they feel like being kind. Trust me, it wasn't like they were trying to get into my pants or anything. I had kid drool all over me and was wearing my 'wash-day' outfit. Also, I'm not super sure I'll ever be bathing again, so it's not like there was even an olfactory incentive there! I am doing two things right now: composing a post and watching the collected No Doubt videos, both while sitting at my desk in my room."
5,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"It's 11:14 PM MST, and here I am in my bedroom, fixing the personal computer of the personnel director from my job. I don't mind doing it, but sometimes I wonder how often I end up fixing someone else's computer as a favor. I'm glad to be able to help and support people this way, but where is the line drawn before you're being taken advantage of? Over the last couple of weeks, I've been staying up late reading and such, so I was looking forward to going to bed early, until I realized it would be more prudent to return this computer to its owner. *laugh* No rest for the weary, right? So I found myself watching Joe Schmo 2 again tonight."
6,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Could you remind me what I wrote about before this? Or, perhaps, this is a continuation in the ""Is this a date?"" saga. So, after the awkward lunch, with my confidence shaken, I realized I forgot to tell you an important part of the story. Before Pat showed up for lunch, Dustin began talking about what a nice guy Pat is and how he's trying to find a girlfriend for him. As I listened and nodded, I realized we were talking more about finding a girl for Dustin's best friend than about whatever you typically discuss over pink lemonade with a stranger. I excused myself to the bathroom, looked in the mirror, and silently asked: Am I being set up with the other guy? Is this what's happening now?"
7,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"I would like everyone to think before they act. In fact, I'd like each and every person in the world to consider their actions before getting out of bed in the morning and commit to thinking all day. If they're not prepared to do so, I'd very much prefer they hop back into bed and drift off to an eternal slumber. I'm utterly tired of dealing with foolish people. No, I'm not claiming to be the smartest person in the world, but I'm not referring to matters that demand a lot of brainpower. Therefore, I believe it's fair to criticize those who are recklessly ignorant. Let's see if I can limit this particular rant to a few types of individuals, and we can save others for another day, sound good? Great."
8,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Two issues arise from the scenario I discussed in my previous post: 

1. While it's true that Bush is stimulating the economy, he's doing it the wrong way. Robert Rubin mentioned on NPR's Marketplace today that Bush could have achieved the same economic stimulus without the long-term debt burden by implementing different, temporary tax cuts that would benefit low- and middle-income individuals. Ah, Robert Rubin—just hearing his name is delightful. Now, quickly: can you name a Bush administration official on the domestic side with Rubin's level of gravitas? Still thinking? It might come to you...

2. We can't just entrust the Republicans with control during wartime since they've cleverly concocted an endless, global 'war on terrorism.'"

Like you're sitting in math class, bored out of your mind, and you wonder what exactly happens in your brain that helps you understand math. Then you realize that you exist, you're in math class, and you ask yourself why. You start to appreciate how amazing existence is. Suddenly, it hits you—this random train of thought is incredibly pathetic. Ever had that happen? I hate that. You know what else I hate? Block schedules. Who came up with that idea? Anyone can see that sitting through a two-and-a-half-hour class in any subject is cruel and unusual punishment."

Tonight, Andy beat me by a few dollars and won the game, or perhaps I let him win because he's leaving in a few hours, and I wanted him to feel good on his last night here. Whatever the case, nothing compares to this Texas-sized headache I have right now. I've taken some Aleve, and I must say they're doing wonders. All I need now is some well-deserved rest and relaxation... ""At the Drive-In"" was playing while we wrapped up the evening."

We drove home from Indiana, and I'll have to be selective about what I write since I could easily fill pages, but I just don't have the energy for it. To start, I must say camp was fantastic—far better than I expected. God has been doing amazing things in my life recently, and it's just incredible. I feel like I've turned over a new leaf. Anyway, back to the beginning: we arrived at the Twiggs' house on Friday evening and stayed there until we left for camp on Monday. Most of our activities included going to the fair, attending church, watching a parade, visiting Walmart, and watching movies."

I hate that, but I’d rather get it over with than try to schedule it during the first month of my surgery rotation. I’m definitely nervous, scared, jittery, and any other words you can think of for 'hell no, I don't want to go' to school. This is going to be a whole new ball game for me. As a perfectionist, I love excelling at everything I do. But starting new things is tough. I hate being a pawn (like I told Cassie: 'I'm going to be the only pawn on the chessboard who insists on moving like a knight'), and I hate not knowing what's going on."
14,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Arun Shourie discusses how the current Governor of Uttar Pradesh warned, as early as 1996, about the impending threat of the rise of a ""Third Islamic State"" in the subcontinent. T.V. Rajeswar, the former head of the Intelligence Bureau and the present Governor of Uttar Pradesh, predicted this serious threat in a series of articles published in The Hindustan Times back in 1996. Shourie raises a valid point when he asks, does knowing that it was Rajeswar, and not him, let alone Mr. Advani, who wrote those warnings make them ring true? Or do you conclude that because Rajeswar wrote them, he must be a hidden communalist and should not remain the Governor of Uttar Pradesh?"
15,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Attitude: bored; mood: indifferent. I'm looking forward to tonight after a long, hard day in the trenches, folks. There was almost no time to write anything for you readers. However, it's great to see Tigger (now Akcron) taking the reins herself, making an appearance, and discussing things. Not much to add—yesterday was Shakespeare on the Green. It was a lovely play, but I had to leave before the final curtain, which was a bit disappointing. Hopefully, I'll see an entire Shakespeare play someday. But I digress. Akcron is right about the issues with the shower—it really is terrible. You have to admit that watching someone grimace in self-torture can be pretty entertaining."
16,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"All of a sudden, for the past two days, I have been overwhelmed with terrible bouts of exhaustion. Bone-deep exhaustion. Last evening, I went home and just slept, only waking when my mother called me around eight thirty. When I woke up, it was all dark, and I hadn't turned the lights on, so I couldn't figure out the time or date for a few seconds; it was just my mother's voice in the darkness and me grappling with reality. I wonder why I'm feeling so drained... It's nice weather this morning. It was drizzling when I came in, though I hear it's been raining for the past three days in Calcutta."
17,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Last night was the worst. I threw away the sweater I was knitting. I had only completed about 14 inches. I lost probably $10 worth of yarn (it's $8 a skein). But I had too many stitches by the time I got to the armholes, and the mohair was knotting itself together as I knitted, so frogging (ripping out rows) didn't work well. The yarn broke frequently. I didn't even swear, which is unusual for me. I just morosely ripped and listened to season two of Sex and the City (thank you, library!). Eventually, I got sick of it and threw it away. I suppose I could say I learned a lot while trying to make this sweater."
18,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Last night in class, we discussed that week’s assigned reading, ""Getting Back Into Place: Toward a Renewed Study of the Place-World"" by Edward S. Casey. The first chapter addresses “implacement” and the second, “displacement.” In the first chapter, Casey argues that our contemporary world and culture revolve around time as the situating force: we are running out of time, we have saved time, we are just in time. He suggests that centering culture around place creates a more grounded community. (This is a very rough summation, just a disclaimer in case my professor or any classmates read this post.) So far, this is the first book that has truly grabbed my attention."
19,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Whatever they put in freeze pops to give them those vibrant colors, there should be some sort of warning: may make your life a bit unusual. While giggling is enjoyable, one wonders if we would have ended up on that fire escape, drinking beer in the fierce wind, had we not been eating them earlier. We found ourselves in a doorway to a bar that was sadly out of business, where we paused to examine an office supplies catalog that had arrived in the mail. It's fortunate we did. Who could have guessed that within its pages were the special offers of a lifetime? Not I, for one. I list but a few: buy 36 permanent marker pens, get a stunt kite. Buy 30 lever arch files, get a barbecue."

Senate Republicans, okay, hands up—who watched the 39-hour judicial nominations marathon last week? I know I didn't. Well, okay—I did tune in once or twice. The entire colossal waste of time was orchestrated by Republicans, annoyed that Democrats wouldn't easily approve four of Bush's controversial justices, attempting to score political points with a multi-day spectacle. Never mind the fact that Democrats have already approved 168 of Bush's judicial nominees—no, that's not good enough for the power-hungry Republicans, who for some reason are operating under the misconception that they have a huge mandate for this kind of behavior."
21,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"This was a great weekend. I indulged in nature's bounty, and after a long time, I listened to a lot of Nevermore (something I should have started doing much earlier) and read extensively. I completed three books over the weekend: Bruce Sterling's ""Heavy Weather,"" Larry Niven's ""World of Ptavvs,"" and Octavia Butler's ""Parable of the Sower."" ""Heavy Weather"" was an engaging cyberpunk journey through a near-future USA, ravaged by global warming and general anarchy. While it was clever, well-paced, and very convincing, I must confess that I didn't leave with any particularly significant impressions about the story or the characters. Not that they aren't well constructed or vividly described—it’s a good book, but not a great one, I suppose."
22,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"The aftermath of the first week back from practicum was a real struggle, but it is only in the second week that the fog has truly begun to lift. Post-practicum trauma was a hidden issue that is only now becoming apparent. I was affected, but meeting with the course coordinator finally allowed me to unburden myself and, in doing so, I have prevented another person from being assigned to such a pedagogically deficient practicum school. Yesterday (Monday), I ran into another distressed classmate who was determined to warn the student assigned to her previous school about how terrible it would be. I calmed her down and suggested we should approach the administrator first."
23,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Things can get incredibly busy here at times, but there's always room for some stress-relieving activities. I've discovered that I'm not particularly good at 8-ball or ping pong! Rick (the Canuck) regularly beats me—we have a ping pong table in the front lobby of our building, and there's always time for a 'quick round.' Last night, I participated in an 8-ball tournament at the Hot Spot (our recreation tent, complete with a popcorn machine, numerous TVs, a jukebox, DVD rentals, a pool table, dart board, and always the ping pong table). I was doing quite well throughout my one and only game until I scratched on the eight ball. Despite that, I had a pretty good time—the highlight being the two Dutch soldiers who joined the tournament."
24,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Fall 1974: I was attempting, for what felt like the 13th time, to fight my way through the second chapter of my high school algebra book. I was not then, nor am I now, a math person. I hate math. I am math phobic. You get the picture. As I struggled to make sense of algebra, the doorbell rang. I put down my book and went to open the door. No one was there. Great. I returned to my studies, and just as I was finding a little glimmer of understanding buried in my subconscious, the doorbell rang again. Bam, just like that, my breakthrough disappeared. I went to the door, and once more, no one was there. Just what a struggling math student needs—an uninvited practical joker."
25,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"This past week has been nothing short of exhausting. I spent Tuesday through Thursday completing the move to my new classroom. The new room is bigger and closer to my grade-level team, which are factors I need to consider as I spend countless hours preparing my room for the year. Had I known about the move before the school year ended, I would have discarded many of the books and supplies I no longer use. Unfortunately, everything came with me. So this week was dedicated to moving, unpacking, and purging extensively. I have to thank my teammate Jill for helping with all of this. You see, she was still teaching this month, in my old room. So she and her wonderful students moved almost my entire room for me!"

I will always be reminded of the few nights we spent together, hearts and limbs entwined in a soul-embrace, drenched in the salty darkness of a beach evening... Or that kiss under the rain.

Or, let me rephrase that: the article I'm working on and its consequences aren't really something I'm comfortable with. Perhaps it's because I don't believe in it enough that I can't fully grasp the essence of it—the angst behind it, the unwavering passion to question. I've grown up in a country where you don't ask questions. Really, you just don't. They're willing to shoot you for that, or put you in jail with internal security acts.

We embarked on a trek to the falls, which took about 30 minutes. We were all out of breath—whew!—but we made it. The water was icy cold, and you could feel your body numbing from the chill. We stayed for less than an hour before heading to a nearby waterfall, which was another 30-minute trek. The trip was worth it, as the falls were calming, and the entire scene was truly breathtaking. It felt as if we were becoming one with nature. Soaking in the cold water was like communing with Mother Earth. The cool air and water were enough to lull you to sleep."

When I go upstairs after arguing with Nicole about Kelli—like I just did a few minutes ago—and they ask me what's wrong, it frustrates me. I don't have to explain what's wrong all the time.

As a non-American blogger, I’ve been somewhat hesitant to engage in some of these discussions, especially those involving flags. However, since I initiated the topic (not the flag-burning), I feel compelled to comment. First, I think the idea of enacting a law against flag-burning is utterly absurd. Once you start giving a symbol—any symbol—that kind of unconditional reverence and protection, you're taking a small yet significant step toward totalitarianism. Symbols are somewhat fickle—they don't inherently represent anything; it’s what they are perceived to mean or made to represent that truly matters."

It retold the story, but it wasn't particularly gripping, and I don't feel like I gained anything from watching it. The character development was rather weak. Additionally, I thought the score was poor, essentially a knock-off of ""Gladiator.""

Re: Disruption in PX Day-Ahead Auction Due to ISO Rule Changes

Last Friday's emergency tariff filing by the California ISO has adversely affected the PX day-ahead auction market. The combination of soft and hard caps leads to a complete disconnect, posing unacceptable risks to all participants. This situation is unlikely to assist the ISO in achieving its intended decrease in real-time energy sales and procurement. As a result, suppliers will likely continue to defer to the higher price opportunities offered by the ISO. The PX is actively petitioning Terry Winter of the ISO to allow for immediate adjustment bids on any submitted schedule at any relevant price."

I did not find anyone in EBS who seems to know or be involved in any e-procurement issues. However, within Enron Corp, there is an initiative called iBuyIt. This system is being deployed for e-procurement across Corp and ENA, and is expected to reach EBS sometime later this year. John Gillespie is in charge of the iBuyIt initiative. Perhaps he is the appropriate contact. I left him a voicemail but have not yet received a response.

87,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,email_content,"The spreadsheet below provides the implicit commodity based on the effective date of four different rates for the same rate schedule (Schedule DR). The rate schedule effective from August 2000 through September 2000 results in a significantly larger commodity charge because SDG&E customers will receive a lump sum reimbursement from SDG&E over those two months. Consequently, SDG&E customers can expect lower electric bills. Assuming the lump sum reimbursement is not included in the implicit energy component, the average from June 2000 through January 2001 is 6.2 cents, while the implicit commodity average from February 2001 through December 2001 is 7.3 cents. The average implicit commodity from June 2000 through December 2001 is 6.9 cents; for deliveries starting September 1, 2000, the average would still be 6.9 cents."

Absolutely amazing—I have nothing negative to say about this game as it has exceeded my expectations and will likely exceed yours too. The movement is fluid, it's free from bugs and crashes, and there's a wealth of story and content to engage with. You have options for each day, such as multiple practices, events (sponsorships), and even games. This review is based solely on playing MyCareer, and so far, it's a 10/10.

97,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"Magic fans, beware... Wizards seems reluctant to create a truly satisfying digital game. At its heart, Magic: The Gathering is a social game meant to be enjoyed with friends (or frenemies), filled with laughter, banter, and dramatic game-winning moves. Wizards of the Coast appears to have forgotten this. If you decide to play with friends, you can't earn gold—and gold is crucial. It's so vital that they've set a daily cap, which is understandable since gold unlocks everything in the game. But brace yourself for a long and monotonous 1v1 grind against the computer or random opponents, whom you can't even communicate with.

98,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"Being the third installment in the trilogy, I'll address the drawbacks first. I really dislike prequels as they move backward in the storyline instead of forward (a common issue with prequels). Although they offer more in terms of story, the combat in this installment feels sloppy and lacks the sharpness that Arkham City achieved. As of writing this review (26/10/2013), there is a game-breaking bug that prevents a side mission from being completed (though the main story remains unaffected). Some gadgets are assigned to an inconveniently placed hotkey, requiring a stretch across the keyboard. While this may seem minor, it can potentially disrupt your combo during combat."
99,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"They improved Shadow Warrior (2013) significantly. The boss fights are excellent, and the weapons feel satisfying—perhaps not quite on par with those in Doom 2016, but still solid. Enemies aren't too resilient, provided you're adept at managing elemental and upgrade aspects. The upgrade system is well-balanced, and once you get the hang of it, it's not too cumbersome. The elemental features and limited ammo naturally encourage you to use a variety of weapons. There are many cool, unique weapons (a key point when comparing to Borderlands' formula of 'RNG' weapons) that remain viable for most of the game. The music is fantastic, especially the main theme and Stan Bush's contributions."
100,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"So many things were done wrong. I don't even know how to start this review. This all refers to MyCareer. My player is an outside scorer, a point guard, 1.71m tall, with maxed stats and all necessary perks. Okay, now tell me, why does shooting skill depend on a person's height? Why can someone who is 1.74m not become as good at shooting as someone who is 1.71m? I'm 1.87m in real life, made my first player with this height, and noticed I can't reach a higher skill than 89. Why? That's pure discrimination! And why doesn't the game tell me that before I create a character or even when I reach the skill limit after weeks of playing?!"
101,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"I think this Assassin's Creed game nailed the mechanics across the board, from ship battles and sailing to hunting (fish) and parkour. I felt much more attached to this character as well. The story starts off quite rough but improves significantly as you progress (I think this is true for every AC game, personally). Edward was a particularly interesting character, as were all the side characters. I felt like all the collectibles actually meant something in this AC game, which I never got from any of the previous ones. Perhaps it’s because they seemed to have a bigger purpose in the game. They definitely weren't required, but they were fun to collect, and the rewards were very balanced."
102,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"While I personally cannot recommend this game, it's not entirely terrible. The gunplay is decent, as long as you can afford to buy gun parts. My main complaint is that the game operates on a pay-to-win model. If I could overlook that, the game would be enjoyable since the hardsuit is fun to use and HRV is an excellent concept. I would choose this game over any Call of Duty title any day, but its pay-to-win microtransaction format is off-putting for me. If you're okay with this model, then by all means, enjoy. However, if you're like me and dislike pay-to-win games, it's best to pass on this one; it's not our cup of tea."
103,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"While not perfect, this game has been thoroughly enjoyable. The save system and the possibility of sudden death can lead to some frustration. I'm on my first playthrough and lost my main character around hour 10 of an approximately 20-hour experience. I would have appreciated a save to reload at that point. I've since picked up a third-party mod/save tool to avoid catastrophic failures. Additionally, the aiming reticule is somewhat small, and the zoom is underpowered. Despite these issues, it's been a blast. I'm not usually a fan of zombie games, but the combination of strategy, missions, and first-person shooter/beat 'em up elements is fantastic. I've been playing it as often as I can—just one more mission, just one more supply run—or I'm running away and want to secure a safe spot before shutting the game down."
104,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"An absolutely great strategy game! Having played every other wargame, like European Escalation and ALB, I must say this one fits in perfectly. The number of units is impressive; I'm not sure exactly how many there are, but there's a ton! The graphics are stunning, the sounds are excellent, and the gameplay overall is epic. The in-game chat box at the main menu is quite entertaining as well—I'm not kidding. However, if anyone thinks this game is 'easy' or you're new to the strategy genre, it might take some time to master. Don't get discouraged; you will lose a lot of units. Just make sure you plan ahead and always have anti-air and anti-tank defenses."
105,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"I was initially biased against this game before I played it and wasn't even sure about buying it. I don’t know; the whole portal gun and portals concept seemed odd to me, even though I like science fiction. Boy, was I wrong. The jokes and voice acting in this game are phenomenal—simply amazing. It's not cheesy (okay, sometimes it is), and each character has their own unique sense of humor and distinct personality. And the level design? It's just fantastic. By the way, I never played the first Portal game. One of these days, I'm planning to, if I can find the time. I would never have played it if I hadn't played the sequel."
106,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"Alright, let's start with the pros (+) and cons (-), followed by my thoughts on this game. 

+ Some of the best characters
+ Good story
+ Lots of content
+ Customizable character (you can choose to be male or female)
+ You can have a relationship with most of your companions (yes, fangirls, you can have a love interest)

- Poor graphics (though I don't think graphics really matter)
- Weird and awkward love scenes
- Invisible walls
- There's one mission that, in my opinion, was boring, but everyone has different tastes

+- This isn't really bad or good, but for those who care, your protagonist can't talk.

Now for my thoughts. I love this game. It is probably one of the best RPGs or games in general I have ever played. If you're an RPG fan, you probably already have this game."
107,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"Yes, this is a nostalgic journey for thirty-somethings who remember (especially in the UK) watching the ever-irritating Timmy Mallett just to catch the five-minute Transformers cartoon. The voice actors for Optimus, Megatron, Bumblebee, and many others have returned and are instantly recognizable. The distinctive cartoon transformation sound is present. Graphically, the cel-shaded presentation is perfect and very reminiscent of Generation One. Beyond that, it's actually a very fun game. The combat mechanics are extremely well done. Transforming mid-fight often becomes necessary and is seamlessly woven into combos, making it quite distinct from High Moon's excellent War for/Fall of Cybertron games. Another distinction is the heavy focus on melee combat, although some enemies (e.g. Seekers) require switching to a ranged blaster."
108,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"I downloaded the game and played it for a little while, but it was nothing special. I spent more time trying to log in than actually playing. There's a bug where it says there's an update to the terms of service, and whenever you click 'accept,' it just pops up again. You have to restart the client for it to work. That isn't too bad, but why do I need to link my Steam and GFACE accounts? They say it's for DLC, but why is that even necessary? It's also not reversible, so now a company I don't care about has access to my Steam information. As for the game itself, it's just okay. It's easily recognizable as a COD clone, but somehow, they made the gunplay worse. How is that even possible?"
109,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"4K resolution at 60fps (GTX 970), dual audio options, and includes Neptune gear—what's not to love? Check it out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nygsb617tmo. It's an excellent port and a great entry point for newcomers to the series. Keep in mind, though, there's a lot of (skip-able) dialogue. As usual, it's recommended to use a gamepad; however, I personally had no issues with a keyboard/mouse setup, both of which are completely rebindable. The price is reasonable, and I wouldn't have been unhappy with the purchase. More than half of the DLC is included for free, providing ample content to enjoy. I recommend this game to all fans of JRPGs/anime/visual novels, as long as you don't mind long breaks between the action. Cheers.

110,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"I experienced no performance issues even at release, and after all the patches, it plays exceptionally well. In my opinion, this is truly a great and entertaining game, although the format can be somewhat annoying (as the free-roam city area repopulates with new enemies every time you progress in the story). I particularly enjoyed the 'dual play' segments (where you can play as Batman along with one other character), and I greatly appreciated the ability to use the controller for most parts of the game and switch to the mouse and keyboard for the tank combat segments. Driving your Batmobile around the free-roam city—especially when chasing the APC commanders—becomes quite enjoyable once you master using the brakes to skid around corners. Once you get the hang of it, driving around the city is truly enjoyable!"
111,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"Damn fine AAA FPS shooter—that's the bottom line. It looks, sounds, and plays great—excellent FPS mechanics, a nice story, cool characters, flawless voice acting, and a badass soundtrack. Not for the faint-hearted though—some of those cutscenes were quite cruel and vivid. But when a game is so great overall, it's easier to spot the flaws, and here they are as I saw them: - no SLI support—seriously? I had to put the game aside until I upgraded my card, as it ran poorly on my old dual GPU GTX 590. Make sure you have a fairly decent single GPU card. - Ridiculously small obstacles are often unclimbable."

- Graphics: The game is designed in a comic-like style. The graphics are very sleek, with no unnecessary details and nice color schemes. It totally works for this game. The graphics can be set to 'high' without stressing your system. I run this game on an i5 Pentium processor with an NVIDIA GeForce 710M card and 8GB of memory, and it runs smoothly on Windows 8.1.

However, don't buy this game thinking it's like COD, Battlefield, or any other shooter game. It's in a class of its own and should be treated as such. I can't tell you how many times I've heard new players complain about getting killed really fast. Oh, heaven forbid you get shot in the face and actually die. It's not like that doesn't happen in real life or anything. Edit: Okay, so I've been playing this game for a while now. I've invested all sorts of money into it. It's one of the best multiplayer games around and a great choice when you're not in the mood for CS:GO."

The gameplay is solid, the art design is beautiful, the music is surprisingly high-quality and fitting, and the story and world have captured my interest. The puzzles are fun as well. However, the standout feature of this game is the comedy. If you've played any RPG since they first emerged, you'll appreciate the various jokes, parodies, and references. Even if you've never played an RPG before, you'll still enjoy the humor. If you've played Final Fantasy 7 or X, you absolutely need to try this game. Without revealing too much... I actually had to stop playing after two hours to give my cheeks a break from laughing and smiling so much. What a delight so far."
115,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"I'm really sorry; I try to be supportive of free-to-play games and indie developers, but I really didn't enjoy this game. The description sounded right up my alley, but the execution did nothing for me. I love puzzle and exploration games, but I found this game to be completely unintuitive, and even after looking up how to progress, I still just didn't find the gameplay itself fun. It also completely lacks a pause button, or if it does have one, I never found it. Considering that a lot of sequences in the game are timed, this seems like a critical oversight. I also feel like this game is more cut scene than game, and I end up sitting around drumming my fingers a lot."

My gut churned the entire time, but I pressed on for Uncle Fred! If you guys made a DLC or a sequel, I would be the first to buy it and recommend it to everyone I know.

In previous games, you followed Earth's timeline, progressing through periods like the Stone Age, Medieval Age, and Modern Age. However, in this game, you're set in the future on a mission to colonize a new planet. What I enjoy about this game is that 2K adopted a fresh approach by introducing new mechanics such as the Affinity System and Orbital Layer. However, I found that these new mechanics could make the game somewhat overwhelming at times. One area of improvement for the game could be incorporating more diverse artwork, particularly in the environments encountered during interactions with other leaders."
118,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"Great game! Tons of replayability and a very fun zombie survival experience! Definitely in my top 5 zombie games ever played. Edit: After playing 60+ hours, I can honestly say this is one of the better, more ""realistic"" zombie games. It's designed very much like a survival horror game, as you must conserve your ammo, heal your wounds when you bleed, take pills when you're infected, etc. I also find the zombies to feel very natural and well-animated for a free-to-play game. P.S.: I would recommend getting 1 or 2 friends to play with, but the community is super friendly, and you can usually make friends/talk with people in the chat or over voice comms."
119,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"02/07/2014 - It's a shame I can't fully recommend or enjoy this game. From the short time I've played it, I know I'd be addicted if it weren't for the following two game breakers: 

1. No Australian servers - One red bar puts you at a severe disadvantage and creates unbearable lag. I even played through the offline training mode, and it was stuttering and lagging as well (how does that even happen?). Coupled with poor ping, it just ruins the game.

2. Everything artifacts like crazy - menus, backgrounds, training, and in-game. I've never experienced this before with this card, and I thought it might not like my overclock. I set my GPU back to stock, and sure enough, it didn't make a difference."
120,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"Very late last night, I finished this. The story isn't very deep or interesting, but what makes it stand out is the storytelling. The atmosphere is rich, and the many collectibles do a great job of fleshing it out. I did learn a lot about the world of Batman, so it was a bit disappointing that there were so few bosses in the game. Oh well, there are enough future games to rectify that. The combat offers the right amount of challenge, though it's more on the easy side. Leveling up Batman wasn't very satisfying; it's the gadgets you upgrade and acquire during the campaign that add nice new gameplay mechanics. Gaining access to previously unreachable places provides a nice sense of progression."
121,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"'To the Moon' is no mere game; it is a veritable experience and one of the best of my life. Think Telltale's 'The Walking Dead' is sad? Well, it's no match for 'To the Moon'! Never before have I been so depressed yet fulfilled by something purely fictional. This masterpiece represents the pinnacle of storytelling, in my opinion, and the soundtrack is a gorgeously charming and perfect accompaniment. Yes, the controls are a bit finicky, and the gameplay is not the strong point, but the story is so fantastic that I did not care one bit. Plus, the humor in the game is great and does not intrude upon the distinguished nature of the story... And the Doctor Who references are endless."

The game offers plenty of choices, including deciding what to construct for strategic advantages, selecting weapons and power-ups, and choosing drinks for bonus effects. The art style and music are fantastic, with vibrant visuals that prove the apocalypse doesn't have to be dull. Best of all, the game features narration that responds to your actions. For instance, if you pick up a weapon and then swap it for another, the narration will comment on your choice of the new weapon."
123,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"I originally bought this game during its early development stage, back when the only currency was spacebux and there was no 'tech tree'. During this time, the game was very enjoyable. All the guns were equally overpowered, so there were no issues with imbalance; everyone could defeat anyone at any time. Additionally, the game provided unlimited gun slots and five loadouts. You would expect that in a game boasting 'bajillions of guns,' they would offer more than just 6 weapon slots and 3 loadouts before requiring you to pay for more. At one point, I had accumulated about 3 pages of guns and was brainstorming new ideas for more because, personally, that's where I found the fun."
124,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"This game turned out to be a delightful surprise. Often, rave reviews can be misleading, but in this case, they perfectly capture the fun of this unique little game. It blends the elements of a classic 2D platformer and a MOBA with style. I enjoyed characters in this game that I typically wouldn't in other MOBA games. I had anticipated the same disinterest with others but decided to try a melee tank anyway. I was pleasantly surprised by the experience and ended up experimenting with more characters as they became available through gameplay. The art style and interface are uniquely charming. Consequently, I now use one of the characters as my avatar and have created a wallpaper for the game from a card set."

It's been a while since a game has had that effect on me. The music sets the mood perfectly, the sound effects are spot-on, and the controls are flawless. I look forward to every combat, and they've optimized it extremely well. I had my doubts about the naval combat system, but it is so much fun to lay waste to multiple fleets at a time! The only way to lose in this game is by failing to retreat. If the combat looks overwhelming, just get out of there, regroup, and counter-assault. Thanks, devs, for an awesome experience!"

It stands out from other RPGs because you don't have to kill anyone, which is a unique concept in the genre.

Half the story relies on shock value. I was neither shocked nor emotionally moved in any way. Perhaps I'm desensitized, or maybe it was too simple to evoke a reaction from me. The other half of the game attempts to portray (literally) a person in mental decline, dealing with obsession, hallucination, depression, and other issues. In theory, it's a cool idea, but the ""game"" took me just 10 minutes to complete, even after reading and absorbing every detail possible."

It's an excellent way to challenge your mind while still being fun. Although the game isn't heavy on story, it gave rise to one of the most popular games of 2011. I still play and complete this game when I'm feeling bored, and I love revisiting what gave birth to a legend. Gameplay: Portal's gameplay is fairly simple to describe. You use portals to your advantage, along with buttons that activate parts of the puzzle. There are two types of buttons in the game: one you press and one that requires a cube to keep it pressed."

Edit: both bugs have been resolved, and one fix increased my FPS from 60-90 to 80-120. Since most reviews focus on specs, I'll include mine: i5 6600k (~€200), Radeon RX480 (~€200), Z170 Pro-Gaming (~€150), 16GB DDR4 RAM (~€70). Overall, this setup cost around €650, placing it within the medium price range. However, this rig is relatively new. I consistently get 60+ FPS on high settings with VSync enabled. I genuinely can't believe 90% of the comments claiming they have an overkill setup and only achieve 20 FPS."

Divinity: Dragon Commander comes very close to my favorite RTS game, combining it with a grand strategy mode similar to Risk. This combination truly hits the spot for me. I try not to be overly biased, but the ability to transform into a dragon and support, attack, and command troops simultaneously is quite appealing. Honestly, I do enjoy complex RTS games these days, like Civilization V and others, but those tend to cram many complex mechanics, charts, and resources into one intricate game mode."

The graphics are solid for a retro title and the music is pleasant, but together they create some truly beautiful and impactful moments. The script ranges from comedic to dramatic to heartbreaking to hopeful, sometimes all at once, and it does this while cleverly subverting traditional RPG tropes. And all of this is achieved without even delving into the world, characters, story, or gameplay—subjects I could write entire pages about. But instead, I'll just say this: if you like RPGs, play this game. If you enjoy video games, play this game. If you have seven free hours between now and the end of your life, play this game."

There is a fairly steep learning curve to the game's mechanics, which I'm still trying to master; however, this depth of strategy offers you a myriad of ways to achieve goals and capitalize on certain situations.

It's a good game for casual play, though I doubt it will hold your attention beyond a few months unless you particularly enjoy grinding. The positive aspect is that the game is free, so I recommend giving it a try. If you're looking for something quick and engaging, it's worth checking out."

Unfortunately, it falls far short of that. In this game, you move around absorbing increasingly larger objects to grow, allowing you to absorb even bigger things. However, the gameplay isn't as smooth as it should be, the levels lack creativity, and what's present is more like a surreal horror show. I don't mean an entertaining horror show but one that leaves you feeling depressed and questioning if life is all it should be. Every 'living' creature in the game, from small pets to humans, makes me wonder if the creators had an interest in taxidermy."

I thought, ""Oh wow! A simulator of the road to becoming president! That sounds fun!"" Well, it really wasn't. The game starts you off by asking you to pick a side: Republican or Democrat—there is no independent or third-party option. A little disappointed but still optimistic, I continued to see what I could do. I'll give the game credit; the character customization, although limited, is pretty fun to play around with.

The game is rife with bugs. At one point, my Pip-Boy disappeared permanently, and I had to research console commands to retrieve it. Power armor is practically handed to you from the start, and power cores are plentiful in trader shops. This significantly diminishes the value of power armor compared to previous Fallout games. The story is mediocre, and the game overall is average—though it doesn’t crash every 10 minutes like Fallout 3, making it more stable by comparison. Is it better than Fallout 3? No. Better than New Vegas? No. This title was tremendously overhyped considering how disappointing it truly is."

Cons: - Bugs (especially in the environment, where you may get stuck or your shots hit an invisible wall despite having a clear line of sight to the enemy) - The game holds your hand too much - Dumb AI - Enemies always seem to know your location once you're spotted - Frustratingly godlike accuracy from enemies, similar to the first Ghost Warrior - Poor checkpoint system and saves - Unengaging story that I couldn't care less about. I would not recommend it unless it's 90% off; even then, playing the game feels like an exceedingly tedious task, played just to finish it and move on to the next game in my library. Given the time I wasted on the first Ghost Warrior (which was equally boring and left me feeling relieved when I finished it), I probably won't play it to the end."

For one thing, I have a Vive and I'm much more interested in playing room-scale games with the controllers. Additionally, while the game's universe is initially awe-inspiring in its scale, I found that this same scale hindered my enjoyment. The learning curve and the amount of time required to engage in anything interesting at the beginning were both too steep for my liking. Perhaps if I were more patient and had more time for gaming, this would be compelling to me. However, I lack both and there are plenty of other VR games I’d rather spend my time on."
144,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"Without a doubt, this is my favorite first-person shooter of all time. It's not for those who favor run-and-gun tactics. The recoil and ballistics are remarkably realistic: a single hit to the chest, neck, or head from a rifle-caliber weapon almost always results in death unless it just grazes you. Bullets drop over distance, and short, controlled bursts are necessary to stay on target. There isn't an unlimited ammunition pool; if you consistently reload halfway through a magazine, you'll end up with a collection of half-full mags. You can't run indefinitely—if you sprint for a while, your aim will suffer as you catch your breath. Steady your aim by resting your weapon on your elbows while prone or on a window sill. Accuracy diminishes when standing."

The game plays pretty well for me on medium settings, and I am running a GTX 560 with 2GB of VRAM. Initially, the game set itself to high, and it was running a bit sluggishly, but not to the point of being unplayable. When I lowered it to medium, it smoothed out. I'm not sure if I'm just lucky regarding having issues with games or what, but it seems most of the negative reviews come from some really entitled people."

Listen, this game is incredibly fun. Despite the negatives mentioned, there is still variety and strategy to explore. It starts quickly and continues to build momentum. Even though there’s a limited variety of equipment, it always feels like there’s another ship to unlock or skill to level up. The best way to extend the game’s longevity is through mods.

Within this family, we identify a tracking solution characterized by a single parameter that simultaneously controls the fidelity of the transfer, the population of the excited state, and robustness.

Our findings apply when the true mixture components satisfy a certain separation condition and remain valid even when the number of components is over-specified or under-specified.

In practice, due to the exponentially increasing Hilbert-space dimension with respect to system size, constructing an efficient entanglement witness for general multipartite entangled states is very challenging. For $n$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-like states, the most robust witness scheme requires $n+1$ local measurement settings and can tolerate up to $1/2$ white noise. In comparison, the most efficient witness for GHZ-like states only needs two local measurement settings and can tolerate up to $1/3$ white noise."

These geometries can disrupt the axial and equatorial symmetry of the Kerr metric, resulting in a much more complex multipolar structure, offering a pathway to constrain fuzzball models phenomenologically. We find numerical evidence indicating that all multipole moments are typically larger (in absolute value) than those of a Kerr black hole with the same mass and spin. Current measurements of the quadrupole moment of black-hole candidates can impose only mild constraints on fuzzballs, while future gravitational-wave detections of extreme mass-ratio inspirals with the LISA space mission will significantly improve these bounds."

In practical applications, long-term edges are often determined by humans. However, human-specified edges can be costly to generate and may not be optimal for the intended task. To address these challenges, we propose a model based on temporal point processes and variational autoencoders that learns to infer temporal attention between nodes by observing their communication. Since temporal attention governs the propagation of features between nodes, utilizing the dynamics of node interactions to learn this crucial component offers greater flexibility while simultaneously avoiding the limitations of human-specified edges."

In this paper, we present our approach to designing an open-source neural network to classify audio segments into vocalizations produced by the child wearing the recording device, vocalizations from other children, adult male speech, and adult female speech. To achieve this, we gathered diverse child-centered corpora totaling 260 hours of recordings, covering 10 languages."
214,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"Density-based clustering is based on the concept of linking groups to specific features of the probability distribution underlying the data. Referring to a true, albeit unknown, population structure allows the clustering problem to be framed in a standard inferential setting, where the concept of ideal population clustering is defined as the partition induced by the true density function. The nonparametric formulation of this approach, known as modal clustering, establishes a correspondence between the groups and the domains of attraction of the density modes. Operationally, a nonparametric density estimate is needed, and the proper selection of the smoothing amount, which shapes the density and potentially the modal structure, is crucial for identifying the final partition. In this work, we address the issue of density estimation for modal clustering from an asymptotic perspective."
215,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"The tails of diboson production at the LHC are sensitive to interference between the Standard Model and higher-dimension operators that parameterize the effects of heavy new physics. However, helicity selection rules for the diboson scattering amplitudes present an obstruction to the naive interference contributions of dimension-six operators, resulting in the leading contribution to the total diboson rate correction canceling out. In this scenario, careful measurement of the azimuthal decay angles ""resurrects"" the interference, regaining sensitivity to the ""non-interfering"" operators. We examine these signatures in detail and find that the EFT uncertainties associated with higher-dimensional operators are uniquely well-suppressed through the construction of an asymmetry variable, which is generated solely by these non-interfering operators, thus relegating the effects of higher-dimensional, interfering operators to the same level as statistical errors in this observable."
216,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"Causal inference from observational data is a key objective in many data analyses within the health and social sciences. Yet, academic statistics has often been critical of data analyses aimed at establishing causality. The emergence of the term ""data science"" offers a historic chance to redefine data analysis in a way that naturally incorporates causal inference from observational data. As others have done before, we categorize the scientific contributions of data science into three types of tasks: description, prediction, and counterfactual prediction (which includes causal inference). Clearly classifying these data science tasks is essential for discussing the data, assumptions, and analytical methods required to effectively achieve each task. We contend that the failure to clearly outline the role of subject-matter expertise in data analysis leads to widespread misunderstandings about data science."
217,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"The weak gravity conjecture (WGC) posits that superextremal particles must exist in any consistent quantum theory of gravity. The prevailing belief is that these particles are necessary to ensure that extremal black holes are either unstable or marginally stable. However, the implications if this is not the case remain unclear. This note demonstrates that, in a generic Einstein quantum theory of gravity in Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space, the exact stability of extremal black branes conflicts with rigorously proven quantum information theorems concerning entanglement entropy. To resolve this contradiction, a nonperturbative version of the WGC emerges, which aligns with the conventional statement at weak coupling. The argument is broad and does not depend on supersymmetry or any specific ultraviolet completion, relying solely on the validity of Einsteinian gravity, effective field theory, and holography."
218,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"Understanding how strongly correlated two-dimensional (2D) systems can lead to unconventional superconductivity with high critical temperatures remains one of the major unsolved problems in condensed matter physics. Ultracold 2D Fermi gases have emerged as clean and controllable model systems to examine the interplay between strong correlations and reduced dimensionality, yet direct evidence of superfluidity in these systems has been elusive. Here, we demonstrate superfluidity in an ultracold 2D Fermi gas by moving a periodic potential through the system and observing no dissipation below a critical velocity \(v_{\rm c}\). We measure \(v_{\rm c}\) as a function of interaction strength and find a maximum in the crossover regime between bosonic and fermionic superfluidity. Our measurement establishes ultracold Fermi gases as a powerful tool for studying the impact of reduced dimensionality on strongly correlated superfluids."
220,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"We study the transport properties and the superconducting proximity effect in NSN junctions formed by a time-reversal symmetry-broken Weyl semimetal (WSM) in proximity to an s-wave superconductor. We find that the differential conductance and induced pairing amplitudes are significantly influenced by the angle between the junction direction in real space and the axis separating the Weyl nodes in momentum space. We identify the impact of a chiral chemical potential, i.e., the electron population imbalance between Weyl nodes of opposite chirality, on the junction's transport characteristics. Remarkably, we observe net spin polarization of Cooper pairs generated via Andreev reflection in the two WSM regions. The spin polarization is opposite in these regions and is highly sensitive to the chirality imbalance and excitation energy."
221,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"Metal ion implantation into ceramics has been demonstrated as an effective and controllable technique for modifying the surface electrical conductivity of ceramic pieces. This approach has been utilized in various applications. Notably, it offers a method for grading the voltage drop across high voltage insulators, thereby increasing the maximum operational voltage that can be applied without surface flashover. However, a concern regarding the method is the long-term stability of the implantation-induced conductivity, particularly if the implanted metal species is prone to oxidation. Here, we report our examination of the long-term behavior of the surface conductivity of titanium-implanted alumina. The results indicate that after an initial reduction of up to 40% within the first few weeks post-implantation, the conductivity experiences only a very gradual decrease of about 10% over the subsequent year."
222,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"We introduce a novel Skyrme-like conserved current in the effective theory of pions and vector mesons, founded on the notion of hidden local symmetry. The associated charge is equivalent to the Skyrmion charge for any smooth configuration. Additionally, there are singular configurations that can be identified as \(n_f=1\) baryons that are charged under the new symmetry. With this identification, the vector mesons act as the Chern-Simons vector fields residing on the quantum Hall droplet that forms the \(n_f=1\) baryon. We propose that this current is the correct effective expression for the baryon current at low energies. This proposal provides a unified perspective for the two types of baryons and allows them to naturally transform into one another. Furthermore, Chern-Simons dualities on the droplet can be interpreted as a result of Seiberg-like duality between gluons and vector mesons."
223,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"Interfacial spin-orbit coupling in Josephson junctions presents an intriguing opportunity to combine anomalous Hall and Josephson physics within a single device. We theoretically investigate how the superposition of these effects influences the transport properties of superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator/superconductor junctions. Transverse momentum-dependent skew tunneling of Cooper pairs through the spin-active ferromagnetic insulator interface generates sizable transverse Hall supercurrents, which we refer to as anomalous Josephson Hall effect currents. We extend the Furusaki-Tsukada formula, originally established to quantify standard (tunneling) Josephson current flows, to evaluate the transverse current components. We demonstrate that their amplitudes are widely adjustable through the spin-orbit coupling strengths or the superconducting phase difference across the junction. As a clear spectroscopic signature of Josephson junctions, well-localized subgap bound states form around the interface."
224,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"Based on the suggestions from the Monte Carlo experiments in Jiménez (J. of Turbul. 2020), which propose that dipoles are as significant to the dynamics of decaying two-dimensional turbulence as individual vortex cores, it has been observed that the kinetic energy of this flow is carried by elongated streams formed through the concatenation of dipoles. Vortices divide into two families: small, fast-moving cores and larger, slowly moving ones, which can be described as 'frozen' within a slowly evolving 'crystal'. The kinematics of both families are distinctly different, with only the former being self-similar. The latter is mainly responsible for the kinetic energy of the flow, with its vortices forming the dipoles and the streams. Mechanisms for the development of this slow component are also discussed."

Often, the running time of algorithms in this framework is characterized by the quantum hitting time: the time required for the quantum walk to find a vertex of interest with high probability. In this article, we provide improved upper bounds for the quantum hitting time, applicable to several CTQW-based quantum algorithms. Specifically, we apply our techniques to the glued-trees problem, improving the hitting time upper bound by a polynomial factor: from $o(n^5)$ to $o(n^2\log n)$. Furthermore, our methods also enable an exponential improvement in the dependence on precision for the continuous-time quantum walk-based algorithm designed to find a marked node on any ergodic, reversible Markov chain, as demonstrated by Chakraborty et al."

Dry (or ""loss-cone"") EMRIs, previously considered the primary EMRI sources for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, are mainly produced through multi-body scattering in the nuclear star cluster and gravitational capture. In this letter, we introduce an alternative EMRI formation channel: wet EMRI formation facilitated by the accretion flow around accreting galactic-center massive black holes (MBHs). In this channel, the accretion disk captures stellar-mass black holes that initially move on inclined orbits and subsequently drives them to migrate towards the MBH. This process significantly increases the formation rate of EMRIs in such galaxies by orders of magnitude."

Despite this, we expect our recommender systems to attract users from the outset, encouraging them to stay on the website and become active users. This challenge falls into the new user cold-start category, which is crucial to a company's development and even survival. Existing approaches to user cold-start recommendations either require additional user effort, such as setting up an interview process, or utilize side information [10] like user demographics, locations, and social relations. However, users may be unwilling to participate in interviews, and side information on cold-start users is often unavailable."
228,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"Deep learning has effectively addressed numerous problems beyond the reach of heuristic algorithms. It's been successfully applied to wireless communications, even though current radio systems are well-understood and optimal algorithms exist for many tasks. While some improvements have been made by learning individual parts of a receiver, a more effective approach is to jointly learn the entire receiver. This often leads to a challenging nonlinear problem, for which the optimal solution is difficult to implement. To address this, we propose a deep fully convolutional neural network, called deeprx, which processes the entire receiver pipeline from frequency domain signal stream to uncoded bits in a 5G-compliant manner. We enhance accurate channel estimation by carefully constructing the input of the convolutional neural network using both data and pilot symbols."
229,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"Mutation-based fuzzing typically uses an initial set of non-crashing seed inputs, known as a corpus, to generate new inputs through mutation. A corpus of potential seeds often contains thousands of similar inputs, which can lead to inefficient fuzzing efforts through exhaustive mutation from all available seeds. To tackle this issue, fuzzers come equipped with distillation tools (e.g., afl-cmin) that select the smallest subset of seeds, which trigger the same range of instrumentation data points as the full corpus. It is commonly suggested that minimizing the number and cumulative size of the seeds results in more efficient fuzzing, a hypothesis we systematically explore. We present the results of 34+ CPU-years of fuzzing using five distillation approaches to understand their impact on finding bugs in real-world software."

The agents are divided into several groups, where each group contains agents with similar (isomorphic) state transition structures, allowing them to be relabeled into the same template. Based on this template, we design a scalable supervisor whose state size and computational cost remain independent of the number of agents, even under partial observation. This scalable supervisor does not require recomputation, regardless of how many agents are added or removed from the system. We extend our previous results to accommodate partial observation by proposing sufficient conditions for ensuring safety and maximal permissiveness of the scalable, least restrictive supervisor at the template level. An example is provided to illustrate the proposed scalable supervisory synthesis."

An efficient approach for ENF estimation has been introduced, utilizing temporal windowing based on the filter-bank Capon spectral estimator. This method employs a type of Gohberg-Semencul factorization of the model covariance matrix, taking advantage of its Toeplitz structure. Notably, this approach is the first in the field of ENF to use a temporal window, which does not have to be rectangular, prior to spectral estimation. Krylov matrices are used for the fast implementation of matrix inversions. The proposed approach surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in ENF estimation, particularly when a short time window of one second is used in power recordings. In speech recordings, this approach provides highly accurate results regarding both time complexity and accuracy."

In this study, we explored the fluorescence anomalous saturating effect of the nitrogen vacancy defect in diamond. A reduction in fluorescence was observed with high-power laser excitation, which increased the nonlinearity of the fluorescence emission and altered the spatial frequency distribution of the fluorescence image. We employed a differential excitation protocol to extract high spatial frequency information. By modulating the power of the excitation laser, the spatial resolution of imaging was enhanced approximately 1.6 times compared to confocal microscopy. Given the straightforwardness of the experimental setup and data processing, we anticipate that this method can improve the spatial resolution of sensing and biological labeling with defects in solids."
234,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"When random effects are correlated with sample design variables, the typical method of employing individual survey weights (designed to be inversely proportional to the unit survey inclusion probabilities) to form a pseudo-likelihood fails to produce asymptotically unbiased inference. We develop a weight-exponentiated formulation for the random effects distribution that achieves unbiased inference for generating the hyperparameters of the random effects. We contrast our method with frequentist approaches that rely on numerical integration, showing that only the Bayesian method provides unbiased estimation with respect to the sampling design distribution and consistency with respect to the population generating distribution. Our simulations and real data example from a survey of business establishments demonstrate the utility of our approach across various modeling formulations and sampling designs. This work serves as a capstone for recent developments that integrate traditional survey estimation methods with the Bayesian modeling paradigm, bridging two rich yet disparate sub-fields."

Furthermore, novel electronic topological properties, nonlinear elastic properties, and structural phase transformations can occur due to their low symmetry.

For the first time, it was discovered that in a mesogenic polymer—unlike in low-molecular-weight mesogens—the relaxation of the electric birefringence of a melt above the nematic-isotropic phase transition temperature can be represented by a combination of several exponential processes, two of which play a decisive role. These main processes succeed each other across a temperature range of about fifty degrees. Dielectric spectroscopy also enabled the identification of two orientational relaxation processes: the first arises from the rotation of side mesogenic groups, while the second is linked to the motion of main chain segments."
237,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"Deep hashing methods have demonstrated significant retrieval accuracy and efficiency in large-scale image retrieval. Optimizing discrete hash bits remains a central issue in these methods. A common strategy is to employ an activation function, such as $\operatorname{sigmoid}(\cdot)$ or $\operatorname{tanh}(\cdot)$, and minimize a quantization loss to approximate discrete values. However, this approach can cause hash bits to become stuck in the wrong saturated areas of the activation functions, preventing them from escaping. We refer to this issue as the ""dead bits problem (dbp)."" Furthermore, the existing quantization loss can exacerbate dbp. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective gradient amplifier applied before activation functions to alleviate dbp."

The stable case faces constraints from disappearing charged track searches at the LHC and dark matter direct detection experiments, whereas the decaying case is constrained by current multilepton collider searches. Our findings indicate that a two-step electroweak phase transition involving a stable triplet with a negative quadratic term is excluded by direct detection searches, and an unstable triplet with a mass below $230\ \mathrm{GeV}$ is ruled out at a 95% confidence level."

The conventional scenario suggests an initially circular and narrow belt of planetesimals at semi-major axis \( a \), whose eccentricity is elevated to \( e_f \) following the dispersal of the gas disc, due to secular perturbations from an eccentric planet, resulting in a belt of width \( 2ae_f \). In a slight variation of this scenario, narrower belts can emerge if the planetesimals are initially eccentric, which might result from prior planet perturbations during the gas-rich protoplanetary disc phase. Alternatively, a primordial eccentricity could be caused by instabilities that increase the disc's eccentricity, without the involvement of any planets."

In one dimension (1D), the physics of interacting electrons is well-described at low energies by the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) model. However, little has been observed experimentally beyond this linear regime. Here, we report on measurements of many-body modes in 1D gated wires using a tunneling spectroscopy technique. We observe two separate Fermi seas at high energies, associated with spin and charge excitations, along with the emergence of three additional 1D 'replica' modes that become stronger as the wire length decreases. The effective interaction strength in the wires is varied by altering the amount of 1D inter-subband screening by over 45%."

To this end, we combined the kinematic information provided by Gaia for almost all galactic clusters with the largest available sample of cluster ages, carefully correcting for systematic errors. To identify clusters with a common origin, we analyzed their dynamical properties, particularly in the space of integrals of motion. We find that about 40% of the clusters likely formed in situ."

These systems are designed to process image classification tasks and nonlinear dynamic system predictions, respectively. According to our micromagnetic simulation results on the nonlinear responses of MSM and STNO with current pulse stimulation, the recognition of handwritten digits demonstrates that an RC system utilizing a single MSM achieves outstanding performance in image classification.

This ""few-get-richer"" effect arises in contexts with limited distinct item classes (e.g., left-leaning vs. right-leaning news sources), where items are ranked based on popularity. We analytically demonstrate that this effect appears when people prefer to click on top-ranked items and have diverse preferences for item classes. Using simulations, we explore how the effect varies with different assumptions about the environment and human behavior.

With carefully designed patterns, the proposed pruning method consistently achieves accuracy enhancement and improved feature extraction across different DNN structures and datasets. Furthermore, our pattern-aware pruning framework simultaneously accomplishes pattern library extraction, pattern selection, pattern and connectivity pruning, and weight training.

At the same time, off the field, these women were advocating for equal pay, and in some countries, for any pay at all for their sport. Since we were quite captivated, we wanted to watch the games live and determined that one of the Spanish-speaking networks in the US was the best option for us. It wasn't until a few games into the tournament that a friend remarked to me, ""Why does it feel like everything I'm seeing is commercials for makeup, household cleaning products, and diets?"
260,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,speech,"I want to tell you about the future of money, beginning with a story about a culture that lived in Micronesia in the early 1900s, known as the Yap. Their form of money is particularly interesting because they used limestone discs called rai stones. Unlike our coins, the Yap didn't move or exchange these massive stones, which could weigh up to four tons and be 12 feet across. Instead, they kept track of who owned parts of each stone. There's even a story about sailors transporting a stone across the ocean when they encountered trouble, and the stone fell in."
261,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,speech,"You’ve been accused of a crime you did not commit. It’s impossible to prove your innocence. If you insist that you’re innocent, you’ll likely be found guilty and executed. However, if you confess, apologize, and implicate others, you’ll be set free. Do you provide a false confession or risk a public hanging? This was the choice facing those accused of witchcraft in the village of Salem, Massachusetts between February 1692 and May 1693. They were victims of paranoia about the supernatural, misdirected religious fervor, and a justice system that valued repentance over truth. Salem was settled in 1626 by Puritans, a group of English Protestants. Life was strict and isolated for the people of Salem, with battles against their Native American neighbors and groups of French settlers being commonplace."
262,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,speech,"There are currently hundreds of thousands of people on transplant lists, waiting for critical organs like kidneys, hearts, and livers that could save their lives. Unfortunately, there aren’t enough donor organs available to meet that demand. What if, instead of waiting, we could create brand-new, customized organs from scratch? That’s the idea behind bioprinting, a branch of regenerative medicine currently under development. While we're not yet able to print complex organs, simpler tissues, including blood vessels and tubes responsible for nutrient and waste exchange, are already within reach. Bioprinting is a biological cousin of 3D printing, a technique that deposits layers of material on top of each other to construct a three-dimensional object one slice at a time."
263,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,speech,"Good afternoon, I'm proud to be here at TEDxKrakow. Today, I'll discuss a phenomenon that can, and indeed is, changing the world, known as people power. I'll begin with an anecdote or, for those of you who are Monty Python enthusiasts, a Monty Python-type sketch. Here it is: it is December 15, 2010. Someone offers you a bet: you will look into a crystal ball and see the future; the vision will be accurate. However, you must share it with the world. Curious, you accept the bet and gaze into the crystal ball. One hour later, you find yourself in a national TV studio, on a top show, sharing the story."
264,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,speech,"We'll start in 1964. Bob Dylan, at 23 years old, is at the height of his career. Anointed as the voice of a generation, he is producing classic songs at an astonishing rate. However, a small group of critics argue that he is borrowing from other artists' work. Fast forward to 2004: Brian Burton, also known as Danger Mouse, combines the Beatles' ""White Album"" with Jay-Z's ""The Black Album"" to produce ""The Grey Album."" ""The Grey Album"" quickly becomes an online sensation, prompting the Beatles' record company to issue numerous cease-and-desist letters for ""unfair competition and dilution of our valuable property."" Today, ""The Grey Album"" is recognized as a remix."
265,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,speech,"Well, that's quite an obvious statement up there. I started with that sentence about 12 years ago, initially in the context of developing countries. Yet, you're here from every corner of the world. If you imagine a map of your country, you'll likely realize that in every nation, you could draw small circles marking places where good teachers won't venture. These are also the areas from which trouble often emerges. This presents an ironic issue—good teachers tend to avoid exactly the places where they're most needed. In 1999, I began to address this problem with a straightforward experiment in New Delhi."
266,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,speech,"Currently, most refugees live in cities rather than in refugee camps, representing over 60 percent of the global refugee population. With the majority residing in urban areas, there is a pressing need for a paradigm shift and fresh thinking. Instead of wasting resources on building walls, it would be more beneficial to invest in programs that empower refugees to support themselves. (Applause) We always have to leave behind our possessions, but not our skills and knowledge. If given the opportunity to lead productive lives, refugees can support themselves and contribute to the development of their host countries. I was born in the city of Bukavu, in South Kivu, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and I am the fifth-born in a family of 12 children."
267,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,speech,"I have two questions for you. First: whose shoulders do you stand on? And second: what do you stand for? These are the two questions with which I always begin my poetry workshops with students because, at times, poetry can feel like a lifeless art form for old white men who seem as if they were born to be old, like, you know, Benjamin Button or something. I ask my students these questions, and then I share how I answer them, using these three sentences: I am the daughter of Black writers, who are descended from freedom fighters who broke their chains and changed the world. They call me. I repeat these words as a mantra before every single poetry performance. In fact, I was reciting them in the corner over there. I was making faces."

For about five years after graduating from a reputable liberal arts university, this was my day job. (Laughter) I was a self-employed living statue, known as the Eight-Foot Bride, and I love telling people this was my job, because everyone always wants to know who these performers are in real life. (Laughter) Hello. I painted myself white one day, stood on a box, placed a hat or a can at my feet, and when someone came by and dropped in money, I handed them a flower—along with some intense eye contact. And if they didn't take the flower, I added a gesture of sadness and longing as they walked away."
269,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,speech,"On October 4, 1957, the world watched in awe and fear as the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the world's first man-made satellite, into space. This small metal sphere, less than two feet in diameter, ignited a space race between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. that would last for eighteen years and reshape the world. Sputnik was not actually the first piece of human technology to enter space. That distinction belongs to the V-2 rocket, used by Germany in missile attacks against Allied cities as a last-ditch effort in the final years of World War II. Although it wasn't very effective, at the end of the war, both the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. captured the technology and scientists who developed it, and began using them for their own projects."

I'm a voracious reader, delving into works by Ian McEwan as well as Stephanie Meyer. I've read the Twilight tetralogy. I live for my home theater, where I consume DVDs, video on demand, and a variety of television. For me, shows like ""Law & Order: SVU,"" Tina Fey's ""30 Rock,"" and ""Judge Judy""—""where the people are real, the cases are real, the rulings are final""—are essential viewing."
271,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,speech,"Citizens of the world, we are facing a global crisis of unprecedented scale. Please stand by for a message from the Secretary-General of the United Nations, António Guterres. The climate emergency is the defining crisis of our time. We are in a race against time, and we are losing. There is a growing wave of impatience, especially among young people, due to global inaction. We need more ambition from everyone: governments, cities, businesses, investors, and individuals worldwide. That's why I am pleased that you are launching TED Countdown. Your influence and ideas can help accelerate momentum toward a carbon-neutral world by 2050. This is the only way to avert the worst impacts of global warming. We have the tools, the science, and the resources. Let us now enter this race with political will and energy."

But why? At this very moment, over 800 million women worldwide are experiencing their periods. None of us would exist without it, yet it remains an ""embarrassing"" subject to address. From my experience and that of the women around me, I can tell you that it's exhausting. It's exhausting to discreetly pull out a brown paper bag concealing a pad, stuff it into your pocket during class, and rush to the washroom as inconspicuously as possible. It's exhausting to sit through lessons and meetings pretending to be perfectly fine, while internally struggling with intense period cramps."
273,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,speech,"The world's largest and most devastating environmental and industrial project is located in the heart of the largest and most unspoiled forest on Earth, Canada's boreal forest. This forest spans across northern Canada, including Labrador, where it hosts the largest remaining wild caribou herd: the George River Caribou herd, which numbers approximately 400,000 animals. Unfortunately, when I visited, I couldn't spot any of them, but antlers serve as evidence of their presence. Throughout the boreal, we are fortunate to have an incredible abundance of wetlands. Globally, wetlands are among the most endangered ecosystems. They are absolutely critical, as they purify air and water, sequester large amounts of greenhouse gases, and are home to a vast diversity of species."
274,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,speech,"Before the world of humans began, there was the world of the gods, made of fields, plains, and gardens. Four brothers wandered this celestial realm. They had no family other than each other—they didn’t even know who their parents were. One of the brothers, Deminan, looked different from the others. His skin was covered in painful scabs, and he wondered why he alone had been marked with this affliction. One day, while the supreme spirit Yaya was out in his gardens, Deminan and his brothers snuck into Yaya’s house. After feasting and exploring, they spotted a giant gourd hanging in the corner. But as they tried to look inside the gourd, they dropped it."
275,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,speech,"Seven years ago, I graduated from Berkeley with a dual degree in Molecular and Cell Biology and Linguistics. I attended a career fair on campus, which led to an interview with a startup called Theranos. At the time, there wasn't much information available about the company, but the little that was known was quite impressive. Essentially, Theranos was creating a medical device that allowed you to run an entire blood panel using just a finger-stick of blood. This innovation was intriguing not only because it was less painful than traditional methods, but it also had the potential to open doors to predictive diagnostics."
276,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,speech,"My journey to becoming a polar specialist, specializing in photographing the polar regions, began when I was four years old. At that time, my family moved from southern Canada to northern Baffin Island, near Greenland. There, we lived with the Inuit in a small community of 200 people, where we were one of only three non-Inuit families. In this community, we had no television or computers, and not even a telephone. I spent all my time outside with the Inuit, playing. The snow and ice were my sandbox, and the Inuit were my teachers. This is where I became truly obsessed with the polar realm."
277,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,speech,"We're seen as the organization that serves as the last resort for failed social policies. I can't determine who comes to us or how long they stay. We receive individuals for whom all other solutions have failed—those who have slipped through all other social safety nets. They can't manage them, so we must. That's our role: to contain and control them. Over the years, as a prison system, a nation, and a society, we've become very adept at this, but that shouldn't be a source of pride. Today, we incarcerate more people per capita than any other country in the world. We have more Black men in prison today than were under slavery in 1850."
278,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,speech,"I'd like to take you on the epic quest of the Rosetta spacecraft. My passion for the past two years has been to escort and land the probe on a comet. In order to do that, I need to explain something to you about the origin of the solar system. When we go back four and a half billion years, there was a cloud of gas and dust. At the center of this cloud, our Sun formed and ignited. Alongside it, what we now know as planets, comets, and asteroids also formed. According to theory, once the Earth had cooled down a bit after its formation, comets massively impacted the planet and delivered water. They probably also brought complex organic material, which may have sparked the emergence of life."

When we created this ""Build Back Better"" series, our intention was to address issues arising from the pandemic and imagine how we could rebuild from that. However, the events of this past week—the horrific death of George Floyd and the daily protests that have followed—have brought a new sense of urgency that we simply must address. Can we build back better from this? Before we can even attempt to answer that question, we need to seek to understand the immensity of this moment. Whitney Pennington Rodgers: That's right, Chris."
280,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,speech,"In 1903, the President of the United States embarked on a three-day camping trip in California’s Yosemite Valley. President Theodore Roosevelt slept in a grove of towering sequoia trees, camped during a snowstorm, and spent hours in conversation around the campfire with his host and guide, conservationist John Muir. While Roosevelt famously loved the outdoors, Muir had invited him for reasons beyond camping: Yosemite was in danger. Although Yosemite had been designated protected land in 1864, by 1903 the valley was still at risk of overdevelopment. It was at the center of a decades-old struggle to reserve land for both preservation and public use—two goals easier said than done. The battle over Yosemite began with the 1849 Gold Rush when miners surged west, seeking gold in the Sierra Nevada foothills."

All borders are closed on every side. We live in one of the largest prisons in the world. The only thing I can do is look up at the sky.

I was a young reporter, fresh out of college, when I got a scoop. The story was quite simple: police officers were taking bribes from street hawkers. As a young reporter, I wanted to approach it differently to maximize its impact, since everyone knew it was happening but nothing was stopping it. So, I decided to go undercover as a seller. This allowed me to document hard evidence. The impact was great; it was fantastic. This is what many call immersion journalism or undercover journalism."
283,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,speech,"One simple vitamin can reduce your risk of heart disease. Eating chocolate reduces stress in students. A new drug prolongs the lives of patients with a rare disease. Health headlines like these are published every day, sometimes making opposite claims from each other. There can be a disconnect between broad, attention-grabbing headlines and the often specific, incremental results of the medical research they cover. So how can you avoid being misled by flashy headlines? The best way to assess a headline's credibility is to look at the original research it reports on. We’ve come up with a hypothetical research scenario for each of these three headlines. Keep watching for the explanation of the first example, then pause at the headline to answer the question. These are simplified scenarios."

One day, my mom asked, ""What day should we put for their birthday?"" I thought, ""Obviously, the day they were born."" It seemed like a ridiculous question. Then my mom explained, ""Well, Kristen, neither of your little brothers has a birth certificate, so how do you suggest we find out when that was?"" My mind was blown. Now, 20 years later, I'm still working on it. However, instead of just trying to solve the mystery of my brothers' missing birth certificates, I focus on addressing this issue globally. So, what do birth certificates have to do with international development?"

If you had the option to choose that kind of existence, would you take it? This is the question philosopher Robert Nozick posed through a thought experiment he called the Experience Machine. The experiment asks us to consider a world where scientists have developed a machine that simulates real life while ensuring experiences of only pleasure, never pain. The catch? You have to permanently leave reality behind, but you'll hardly notice the difference. Your experiences will be indistinguishable from reality. Life's natural ups and downs would be replaced by an endless series of ups. Sounds great, right?"

A couple of years ago, I was consulted to see a woman in her 70s—a retired English professor with pancreatic cancer. She was experiencing pain, nausea, and vomiting.

As firefighters, my team and I are charged with saving lives and property from disasters such as car wrecks, house fires, and life-threatening medical emergencies. I am a woman leading a department in a male-dominated profession. Ten years ago, I decided to expand my medical knowledge and obtained a nursing degree. This decision was prompted by the realization that the next major threat facing not only my city but others across the country wasn't a single, isolated event. Instead of a one-and-done disaster, where we could arrive like the cavalry, extinguish the fire, and leave feeling confident that everything was okay, it became clear that more complex challenges were emerging."
288,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,speech,"Where does all the carbon we release go? Carbon operates within a natural cycle, present in all living organisms: in the soil, in the oceans, in the atmosphere, and in rocks deep underground. When plants and other living things die, much of their stored carbon returns to the atmosphere until new plants grow and reabsorb the carbon. However, over millions of years, some of the carbon stored in ancient trees and marine life becomes rock, while some becomes fossil fuels: coal, oil, and natural gas. Natural events like volcanic eruptions release some of the carbon trapped in rock, and human activities like burning fossil fuels also release some of that prehistoric carbon. Today, humans release about 60 times more carbon than all the volcanoes on the planet combined each year."
289,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,speech,"Even nature's most unsightly creatures harbor important secrets, but who would want a swarm of cockroaches coming their way? Yet, one of the greatest differences between natural and human technologies is their robustness. Robust systems remain stable in complex and new environments. Remarkably, cockroaches can self-stabilize when running over rough terrain. When we equipped them with a jet pack or subjected them to perturbations like an earthquake, we discovered that their finely tuned legs allow them to self-stabilize without using any brainpower. They can traverse complex terrain, such as grass, without issue and remain stable. We uncovered a new behavior where, because of their shape, they automatically roll to their side to navigate through an artificial patch of grass. Robust systems can perform multiple tasks with the same structure. Here's a new behavior we've discovered."

Now, organized crime has been around for a very long time, as you might point out, and those words would be quite astute. However, in the last two decades, it has experienced unprecedented growth, now accounting for roughly 15 percent of the world's GDP. I like to call it the global shadow economy, or ""McMafia,"" for short. So, what triggered this extraordinary growth in cross-border crime?"

Should we tell our child about the sperm donation? If so, when and what words should we use? Sperm donors are often referred to as ""biological fathers,"" but should we really use the word ""father""? As a philosopher and social scientist, I have been studying these questions about the concept of parenthood. But today, I will share what I learned from talking to parents and children. I will demonstrate that they understand what matters most in a family, even if their family looks a little different."

I see all of that and a man who spent a quarter of his life in state prison—six years, to be exact—starting as a teenager on Rikers Island for an act that nearly cost a man his life. But what brought me from there to here wasn't the punishment I faced as a teenager in adult prison or the harshness of our legal system. Instead, it was the learning environment of a classroom that introduced me to possibilities I never thought were achievable for me or our justice system as a whole.

That's how the media has been portraying people who look like me. One study found that 80 percent of news coverage about Islam and Muslims is negative.

And, like many in their 20s, I expected to solve the world's problems—more specifically, the world's water problems—with my technology. I had a lot to learn. It was seductive to believe that our most significant water quality issues persist because they're so hard to identify. I assumed we just needed simpler, faster, and more affordable sensors.
