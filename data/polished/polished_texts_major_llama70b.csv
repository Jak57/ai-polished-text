Yesterday, I had the opportunity to drive by our new home, and I was thrilled to see the front window filled with boxes - a tangible sign that our move is finally within reach. With closing potentially just around the corner, I'm growing increasingly excited at the prospect of receiving the keys. If all goes according to plan this week, we're on track to finalize the sale a week from Wednesday, and I can barely contain my anticipation. Last night was a late one, as Bethany and I indulged in a movie marathon that stretched well into the early hours of the morning. It's been a cinematic week, to say the least, and I thought I'd take a moment to share my thoughts on the films we've been watching. First up was ""Thirteen,"" a movie that I firmly believe every parent of a teenager should see. I was pleasantly surprised by its thought-provoking portrayal of adolescence, and I found it to be a far more impactful film than I had initially expected. In stark contrast, our second feature of the night was ""Gigli,"" a movie that has been widely panned by critics. While it's safe to say that the film lived up to its notorious reputation, we felt compelled to see it for ourselves, if only to satisfy our curiosity."
3,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,blog,"It's been a challenging week, marked by a bout of tendonitis in my right shoulder, specifically beneath the shoulder blade. The condition is exacerbated by repetitive arm movements, particularly when using a computer mouse. Unfortunately, a recent marathon session of updating my website and attending to other online tasks has left me struggling to muster the strength to engage in even simple activities like drawing. Compounding the issue is a lack of sleep, which has intensified the discomfort. Despite my current frustration, I remain optimistic about a full recovery. On a more positive note, my mother's surgery was successful, and she has begun to experience a partial restoration of her eyesight. While her vision remains limited, she can now discern fuzzy shapes and distinguish colors, offering a glimmer of hope that she will eventually regain her full visual acuity."

While I don't mind lending a helping hand, I often ponder the frequency with which I'm called upon to fix others' computers as a favor. It brings me joy to be able to serve and care for others in this way, but I sometimes wonder where the boundaries lie, lest I risk being taken advantage of. After a couple of weeks of late-night reading sessions, I had been looking forward to an early night's rest, but prudence dictated that I prioritize returning the computer to its rightful owner. It seems that rest is a luxury reserved for another time. Instead, I found myself rewatching Joe Schmo 2, a familiar comfort in the still of the night."
8,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,blog,"A critical examination of the previously outlined scenario reveals two significant concerns. Firstly, while it is true that the economic stimulus package has been implemented, its methodology is fundamentally flawed. As Robert Rubin astutely pointed out in a recent interview with NPR's Marketplace, the administration could have achieved the same level of economic stimulation without incurring substantial long-term debt by opting for temporary, targeted tax cuts that would have disproportionately benefited low- and middle-income individuals. The wisdom and expertise of Robert Rubin are a breath of fresh air, and his presence is a stark reminder of the dearth of similarly esteemed individuals within the current administration's domestic policy team. Secondly, it is imperative to recognize that granting the Republicans unchecked control during wartime is no longer a viable option, given their ingenious yet troubling ability to perpetuate a state of endless, global conflict under the guise of the 'war on terrorism.'"

My last day of vacation has arrived, and it's tainted by a dentist appointment scheduled for 9 am. Although I dread it, I'd rather confront this obligation now than risk having to navigate it during the chaotic first month of my surgery rotation. The looming prospect of returning to school fills me with trepidation, anxiety, and a deep-seated reluctance. This new chapter promises to be a daunting challenge, one that will push me out of my comfort zone. As someone who strives for perfection in all aspects of life, I thrive on excelling and achieving success. However, the uncertainty and unfamiliarity of new beginnings often prove to be a significant hurdle for me. I've always been someone who resists being confined to a predetermined role, instead yearning to forge my own path and defy expectations. The unknown variables and lack of control that come with starting anew are a source of discomfort, leaving me feeling like a pawn on a chessboard, desperate to break free from the constraints and move forward with purpose."

Rajeswar, as far back as 1996, regarding the looming threat of a potential 'third Islamic state' emerging in the subcontinent. At the time, Rajeswar, then the head of the Intelligence Bureau, penned a series of articles in the Hindustan Times, foretelling this ominous threat. Shourie poses a pertinent question: Does the fact that Rajeswar, rather than himself or even Mr. Advani, authored these warnings lend credence to their validity, or does his involvement in sounding the alarm lead to the conclusion that Rajeswar harbors communalist tendencies, thereby rendering him unfit to continue in his gubernatorial role?"
16,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,blog,"Over the past 48 hours, I've been beset by debilitating episodes of exhaustion, leaving me feeling utterly drained. The fatigue is so overwhelming that it's become a struggle to stay awake. Last evening, I succumbed to it, retreating to the comfort of my home and surrendering to a deep slumber. It wasn't until my mother's voice pierced the darkness, calling me around 8:30, that I stirred back to life. Disoriented and groggy, I lay there for a few moments, trying to regain my bearings in the darkness. The only sound was my mother's voice, a lifeline that helped me reconnect with reality. I'm still trying to pinpoint the cause of this exhaustion. In stark contrast, the morning brought a welcome respite, with a gentle drizzle that seemed to wash away some of my fatigue. I've since learned that the rain has been relentless in Calcutta, with the city experiencing a three-day downpour."
18,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,blog,"During a recent class discussion, our analysis of Edward S. Casey's ""Getting Back into Place: Toward a Renewed Study of the Place-World"" led to a thought-provoking exploration of the interplay between time and place in shaping our culture. The book's initial chapters, which delve into the concepts of ""implacement"" and ""displacement,"" offer a compelling critique of our contemporary world's preoccupation with time as the primary situating force. Casey astutely observes that our societal narratives often revolve around time, with phrases such as ""running out of time,"" ""saving time,"" and ""just in time"" dominating our discourse. In contrast, he posits that a place-centric approach to culture could foster a more grounded and cohesive community. While this summary barely scratches the surface of Casey's nuanced argument, it is clear that his work has resonated deeply, making it the first assigned reading to truly capture my attention."
19,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,blog,"The vibrant hues of freeze pops may be a harbinger of the unconventional adventures that lie ahead. A cautionary label, perhaps, to forewarn of the potential for life to take an unexpected turn. While laughter is undoubtedly a universal language, one can't help but wonder if the impromptu escapade up the fire escape, beer in hand, braving the fierce gusts, was somehow precipitated by the earlier consumption of these colorful treats. As fate would have it, a chance encounter with a closed bar led to a serendipitous discovery - an office-supplies catalogue that had arrived in the mail. Little did we know, its pages held the key to unlocking a treasure trove of extraordinary deals. A few of these remarkable offers still linger in our minds: purchasing 36 permanent marker pens would yield a complimentary stunt kite, while acquiring 30 lever arch files would come with a barbecue, a truly unexpected bonus."
20,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,blog,"Presently, I am enjoying the melodic sounds of Stevan Pasero's rendition of ""The Little Drummer Boy."" However, my attention is also drawn to the recent developments in the Senate, where Republicans have been engaging in a protracted and contentious debate over judicial nominations. I must admit that I did not have the opportunity to watch the entirety of the 39-hour proceedings, although I did catch glimpses of it on occasion. It appears that the Republicans, still reeling from the Democrats' refusal to rubber-stamp four of President Bush's more contentious judicial nominees, orchestrated this marathon session as a means of scoring political points. This move seems particularly egregious, given that the Democrats have already approved 168 of the President's judicial nominees. It is perplexing that the Republicans, who seem to be operating under the misconception that they possess a broad mandate for such actions, would choose to pursue this course of action, which can only be described as a colossal waste of time and resources."
21,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,blog,"The past weekend was a respite of unbridled indulgence, marked by a long-overdue reunion with the soothing allure of nature and the sonic landscapes of Nevermore, a band whose discography I had inexplicably neglected for far too long. This period of relaxation also afforded me the opportunity to devour a substantial amount of literature, culminating in the completion of three novels: Bruce Sterling's 'Heavy Weather', Larry Niven's 'World of Ptavvs', and Octavia Butler's 'Parable of the Sower'. Of these, 'Heavy Weather' proved to be a captivating cyberpunk escapade, set against the backdrop of a dystopian near-future United States ravaged by the devastating consequences of global warming and societal chaos. While Sterling's masterful storytelling and meticulous world-building rendered the narrative both convincing and engaging, I couldn't help but feel that the experience, though enjoyable, was somewhat lacking in depth and emotional resonance. The characters, though skillfully crafted and vividly realized, failed to leave an indelible mark on my psyche, leaving me to conclude that, although 'Heavy Weather' is undoubtedly a well-crafted novel, it falls short of being truly exceptional."
22,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,blog,"The initial shock of returning from practicum has finally begun to dissipate, and it's only now, in the second week, that the full extent of the challenges we faced is becoming clear. It's alarming to realize that post-practicum trauma is a widespread issue that has been overlooked until now. Personally, I was deeply affected, but a meeting with the course coordinator provided an opportunity for me to share my concerns and, in doing so, potentially spare another student from a similarly inadequate practicum experience. A chance encounter with a classmate who had also struggled at her assigned school further underscored the need for action. She was determined to warn the student scheduled to attend her school in the upcoming practicum, but I cautioned her that it would be more productive to address our concerns with the administration first."
23,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,blog,"Life can get overwhelmingly hectic at times, but there's always room for leisure activities that promise to alleviate stress. I've recently discovered that my skills in 8-ball and ping pong are, shall we say, less than impressive. My colleague Rick, affectionately known as ""the Canuck,"" consistently outmaneuvers me on the ping pong table conveniently located in our building's front lobby, where we often squeeze in a quick game. Last night, I participated in an 8-ball tournament at our recreation tent, aptly dubbed ""the hot spot,"" which boasts an impressive array of amenities, including a popcorn machine, multiple TVs, a jukebox, DVD rentals, a pool table, a dartboard, and, of course, a ping pong table. Although my tournament run was short-lived, I managed to hold my own until I made the critical mistake of scratching on the eight ball. Despite the disappointing outcome, I had a great time, particularly when two Dutch soldiers joined the tournament, adding a lively and entertaining element to the evening."
24,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,blog,"It was the fall of 1974, and I found myself mired in a desperate struggle to comprehend the second chapter of my high school algebra textbook. As someone who has never been inclined towards mathematics, I was facing an uphill battle. My aversion to math was, and still is, profound. The mere thought of it fills me with anxiety. As I wrestled with the abstract concepts, the doorbell pierced the air, shattering my concentration. I set aside my book and made my way to the entrance, only to be met with an empty porch. The disappointment was palpable. I returned to my studies, and just as a glimmer of understanding began to emerge from the depths of my subconscious, the doorbell rang once more. The fleeting moment of clarity vanished instantly. I rose from my seat, only to be greeted by the same eerie silence. It was as if some mischievous prankster had taken it upon themselves to disrupt my already fragile grasp on the subject, leaving me to wonder if I would ever find solace in the world of mathematics."
25,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,blog,"The past week has been an arduous ordeal, with the relocation to my new classroom consuming a significant amount of time and energy. From Tuesday to Thursday, I dedicated myself to completing the move, taking into consideration the room's advantages, including its larger size and proximity to my grade level team. These factors will undoubtedly enhance my teaching experience, but they also necessitated a substantial investment of time in preparing the space for the upcoming year. In hindsight, had I been aware of the impending move prior to the end of the previous school year, I would have taken the opportunity to declutter and discard outdated books and supplies, thereby streamlining the transition process. However, as it was, I found myself burdened with the task of transporting and unpacking all of my belongings, followed by an extensive purging process. I am deeply grateful to my colleague, Jill, who generously lent her support during this challenging period. Notably, she was still utilizing my former classroom for her summer teaching schedule, and she, along with her students, kindly assisted in relocating the majority of my belongings, greatly alleviating my workload."

Though our paths may not have led to a lifelong commitment, or even a formal union, the love I harbored for you was unwavering and all-consuming. To this day, the echoes of that love continue to reverberate within my heart, a poignant reminder of the fleeting yet unforgettable moments we shared. The memories of our stolen nights, our bodies entwined as one, our souls suspended in the velvety darkness of a seaside evening, or the tender touch of a rain-kissed kiss, remain etched in my mind like a work of art. In the darkest moments, when the shards of heartache pierce my very being, it is your presence that I feel, a bittersweet reminder of the love that once burned bright within me, and still endures, a flame that flickers with every beat of my heart, a love letter to the memories we created, and the piece of you that will forever be a part of me."

The article I'm working on, and its potential repercussions, have left me feeling uneasy and uncertain. I suspect that my reservations stem from a lack of conviction in the project, which hinders my ability to fully immerse myself in the subject matter and tap into the passion that drives inquiry. My upbringing in a country where dissenting voices are silenced, and questioning authority is met with severe consequences, has instilled in me a cautious approach to self-expression. The freedom to speak my mind and challenge the status quo is a luxury I'm still learning to navigate, and it's a far cry from the culture of repression I was raised in. As a result, I've developed a tendency to be more reserved in my interactions, which can sometimes make it difficult for others to connect with me."
28,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,blog,"Yesterday, my colleagues from the bank and I embarked on an excursion to the picturesque Guintubdan, La Carolota. For most of us, it was a maiden visit, and we were eager to explore its natural wonders. Our journey began with a 30-minute trek to the falls, a moderately challenging hike that left us all breathless. However, the breathtaking scenery that awaited us made every step worthwhile. As we immersed ourselves in the icy waters, our bodies began to numb from the cold, but the sensation was invigorating. Due to time constraints, we limited our stay to under an hour, opting to proceed to the nearby waterfalls instead. Another 30-minute trek ensued, but the reward was well worth the effort. The falls exuded a serene tranquility, and the surrounding landscape was nothing short of breathtaking. As I stood there, surrounded by nature's splendor, I felt an overwhelming sense of unity with the earth. The experience was almost meditative, with the cold air and water lulling me into a state of deep relaxation, as if I were communing with the very essence of the natural world."

It's one trait that I didn't inherit from our family, the Buenviajes - a strong inclination towards drinking. While I do enjoy a drink on rare occasions, those instances are few and far between. With only a month left before Ed's departure, I think the reality of the situation is starting to sink in for all of us, including Ed. To be honest, it's been a harsh reality for me for quite some time now. My main concern at the moment is that Ed will be able to be present for Bailey's upcoming surgery.

While this ordeal may be of little consequence to those unfamiliar with the area, I'm simply relieved to have arrived at my destination without further delay. On a more pleasant note, I was surprised to discover that an email I had written to Ivan Maisel of ESPN.com had been published online.

The nightmare, which involved a chaotic scene of gunfire at a news bureau, had left me shaken, but his gentle support helped to calm my nerves. As an added bonus, I have a leisurely morning ahead, free from work obligations, although I do need to make a call to a representative at KMIZ to discuss their rate card.

The June 29 ceremony, attended by nearly 200 people, appeared to proceed without incident, culminating in the attendees being sworn in as new American citizens. However, a peculiar incident unfolded as the newly naturalized citizens prepared to depart. An immigration official, overseeing the swearing-in process, encouraged the crowd to visit a nearby voter registration table, a common feature at such events. Nevertheless, this particular table was staffed by Republican volunteers, who had pre-selected the party affiliation box on the registration forms, effectively enrolling the new citizens as Republicans. This unusual practice raised suspicions among some attendees, including Linda Cross, who was present to witness her husband, Dario Cruz, take the citizenship oath."

It was then that I was surprised by the arrival of my close friend from Florida, a reunion that brought a smile to my face and warmth to my heart. I had missed him dearly, and the added delight of his wife's presence, who is expecting, made the occasion all the more special.

However, having initiated this conversation, I feel compelled to share my thoughts. In my opinion, the idea of enacting legislation to prohibit flag-burning is utterly misguided. The moment a symbol is afforded automatic reverence and protection, a subtle yet significant step is taken towards the erosion of democratic values and the gradual slide into totalitarianism.

The retelling of the classic story lacked the emotional resonance and depth that would have made it truly compelling. Furthermore, the character development was lacking, leaving the audience without a strong emotional investment in the characters' journeys.

Date: Monday, December 11, 2000

Subject: Urgent: Loss of Continuity in PX Day-Ahead Auction due to ISO Rule Changes

We are writing to inform you that the recent emergency tariff filing by the California ISO has significantly impacted the PX Day-Ahead Auction market. The introduction of a hybrid pricing system, combining soft and hard caps, has created an unacceptable level of risk for all market participants. This new system is unlikely to achieve the ISO's desired reduction in real-time energy sales and procurement, as suppliers will continue to prioritize the higher price opportunities offered by the ISO.

In light of this development, the PX is taking immediate action to address the issue. We are petitioning Terry Winter of the ISO to permit adjustment bids on any submitted schedule at any relevant price, in order to restore continuity and stability to the market."

This development comes on the heels of a previous open season, which saw an overwhelming response with bids for 14.4 billion cubic feet per day (bcf/d) of firm transportation capacity, far exceeding the initial offering of 1.2 bcf/d. The pipeline has been facing intense scrutiny from regulators and shippers, who have been urging El Paso to increase its capacity to meet the surging demand and skyrocketing prices in California. In a recent letter, Daniel M.

Derived from the Sanskrit words 'a,' meaning 'not,' and 'himsa,' signifying 'injury,' this concept has been a cornerstone of various Eastern philosophies. As Mahatma Gandhi's understanding of ahimsa evolved, he became increasingly mindful of the impact of his thoughts and words, as reflected in his autobiography, The Story of My Experiments with Truth. In it, he expresses his discomfort with certain lines from a national anthem, which seemed to contradict the very essence of ahimsa.

103,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"This game has been an absolute delight, despite a few notable imperfections. The absence of a more robust save system and the ever-present threat of sudden death can be infuriating at times.

The inability to reload a previous save at that critical juncture was particularly frustrating. To mitigate such catastrophic failures, I've since resorted to utilizing a third-party mod and save tool. Additionally, the aiming reticule could benefit from being slightly larger, and the zoom feature feels somewhat underwhelming. Nevertheless, the game's unique blend of strategy, mission-based gameplay, and first-person shooter and beat-em-up elements has proven to be an irresistible combination. As someone who doesn't typically gravitate towards zombie-themed games, I've found myself thoroughly enthralled by this experience. The game's engaging nature has led me to play it whenever possible, often finding myself drawn into just one more mission or supply run, and frequently having to tear myself away to ensure a safe exit before shutting down the game."

The unmistakable sound effect that accompanies the Transformers' signature transformations is also faithfully recreated, adding to the game's retro charm. Visually, the cell-shaded graphics are a perfect homage to the Generation One aesthetic, capturing the essence of the classic cartoon. However, beneath its nostalgic veneer lies a genuinely enjoyable gaming experience. The combat mechanics are expertly crafted, with the ability to transform mid-battle seamlessly integrated into combos, setting it apart from other notable Transformers titles.

Specifically, the game's tendency to repopulate the open-world city area with new enemies after each story progression can be somewhat frustrating. However, this is more than offset by the game's numerous strengths, including the innovative 'dual play' feature, which allows players to control two characters simultaneously, and the flexibility to switch between controller and mouse-and-keyboard controls for different segments of the game, such as the tank combat sequences. One of the most enjoyable aspects of the game is the opportunity to explore the open-world city in the Batmobile, particularly when engaging in high-speed pursuits of APC commanders.

The numerous jokes, parodies, and references are a loving homage to the classics, ensuring that even newcomers to the world of RPGs will find plenty to appreciate. For fans of iconic titles like Final Fantasy 7 and X, this game is an absolute must-play – but be warned: the laughter and smiles may become overwhelming.

As a result, every player had an equal opportunity to engage and defeat others at any given time. Furthermore, the game generously provided unlimited gun slots and five customizable loadouts, allowing for unparalleled flexibility and creativity. Given the game's boastful claim of featuring an astronomical number of guns, it is perplexing that the current iteration only offers a meager six weapon slots and three loadouts, with additional slots and loadouts available only through in-game purchases. In my heyday, I had amassed an impressive collection of guns, spanning multiple pages, and was constantly brainstorming innovative ideas for new firearms, as this aspect of the game was where I derived the most enjoyment."
124,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"This hidden gem of a game exceeded my expectations in the most delightful way. In an era where glowing reviews often fall short of reality, it's refreshing to find that the praise surrounding this title is genuinely warranted. By seamlessly merging the timeless appeal of a classic 2D platformer with the strategic depth of a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA), the game's unique blend of genres is executed with remarkable flair. What struck me as particularly noteworthy was the way in which the game's character design managed to win me over, even when I initially thought I wouldn't be drawn to certain personalities. My curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to experiment with a melee tank, despite my reservations. The outcome was a pleasant surprise, and I soon found myself eager to try out additional characters as they became available through gameplay. The game's art style and interface possess a quirky charm that has grown on me, to the point where I've adopted one of the characters as my avatar and even created a custom wallpaper from a card set inspired by the game."
125,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"Immersed in the captivating world of this game, I've found myself enthralled for hours on end, with the soundtrack masterfully setting the tone and the sound effects flawlessly complementing the experience. The controls are intuitively designed, allowing for seamless navigation and an unparalleled sense of engagement. The combat system, which initially sparked skepticism, has proven to be an exhilarating experience, particularly in naval battles where the thrill of annihilating multiple fleets at once is unmatched. The key to success lies in strategic retreats and well-timed counterattacks, as overwhelming odds can be turned in one's favor with a tactical withdrawal and regrouping. The developers have truly outdone themselves in crafting an exceptional gaming experience, and I extend my sincerest gratitude for the countless hours of entertainment they've provided."
126,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"The revival of the Devil May Cry franchise has ushered in a transformative era for the series, with its iconic protagonist, Dante, undergoing a significant metamorphosis. Although die-hard fans of the original series may initially lament the changes to their cherished character, this bold new direction, as exemplified by Ninja Theory's latest installment, is undoubtedly a step in the right direction. DmC serves as an ideal entry point for newcomers to the series, offering a captivating origin story that delves into the complexities of a once-arrogant and cynical Dante, and chronicles his poignant journey towards self-discovery and altruism. Through a masterfully woven narrative arc, the game breathes new life into the character, rendering him a compelling and relatable figure to behold. As the story unfolds, Dante is thrust into a corrupt world he had previously chosen to ignore, marking the beginning of a transformative odyssey that will challenge his perceptions and test his resolve."
127,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"Embarking on this enchanting game is a truly delightful experience. The narrative is captivating, boasting an impressive level of detail that weaves a rich tapestry of emotions, humor, and intrigue. Seamlessly balancing lighthearted moments with poignant seriousness, the game masterfully navigates its tone to create a unique and immersive experience. The character design is exceptional, featuring a diverse cast of individuals with distinct personalities and hidden depths, adding layers of complexity to the story. What sets this game apart from its RPG counterparts is its bold departure from traditional combat mechanics, instead opting for a refreshing approach that eschews violence altogether. Drawing inspiration from the beloved Earthbound, a game renowned for its excellence, it's clear that this title is destined for greatness. The soundtrack, in particular, is a standout feature, boasting a memorable and enchanting score that resonates long after the game is finished."
130,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"Despite some initial technical issues, which I personally experienced only twice - one being relatively minor and the other more frustrating, but have since been resolved - I wholeheartedly recommend this space exploration game. Notably, one of the fixes significantly boosted my frame rate from 60-90 FPS to 80-120 FPS. For those interested in the system requirements, my setup consists of an i5 6600k processor, a Radeon RX480 graphics card, a Z170 Pro Gaming motherboard, and 16GB of DDR4 RAM, totaling approximately €650. This configuration falls within the mid-range price bracket, and I've been able to maintain a consistent 60+ FPS on high settings with VSync enabled. I find it surprising that many users, despite having high-end setups, report experiencing frame rates as low as 20 FPS, which starkly contrasts with my own experience."
131,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"The wait for a real-time strategy game of exceptional quality has been nothing short of epic, rivaling the legendary Age of Mythology in its duration. Divinity: Dragon Commander has finally bridged this gap, earning a revered spot among my all-time favorite RTS experiences. What truly sets it apart, however, is the seamless integration of a grand strategy mode reminiscent of Risk, elevating the gameplay to unprecedented heights. I must confess that the ability to transform into a dragon, thereby supporting, attacking, and commanding my troops while simultaneously overseeing unit production, direction, and deployment, has left an indelible mark on my gaming preferences. As a fan of complex RTS games, such as Civilization V, I appreciate the intricate mechanics and multifaceted gameplay that these titles offer. Nevertheless, many modern games in this genre often fall prey to over-encumbering their single game mode with an excessive array of charts, resources, and complicated systems, ultimately detracting from the overall experience."
134,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"In the brief time I've owned this game, the developers have demonstrated a remarkable commitment to its growth, releasing not one, but two substantial DLCs, accompanied by a series of patches that have elevated an already exceptional experience to new heights. The team's active engagement with the community is palpable, evident in the lively discussion forums and insightful dev diaries that offer a glimpse into their creative process. While the game's mechanics do present a challenging learning curve, which I am still navigating, this complexity is a double-edged sword, affording players a staggering array of strategic options to achieve their objectives and capitalize on emerging opportunities. As a result, I firmly believe that the game boasts near-endless replay value, with each playthrough offering a unique and captivating experience that draws me in, regardless of the outcome."
137,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"As an avid enthusiast of politics, I was initially thrilled to discover a game that promised to simulate the journey to the presidency. The concept seemed incredibly engaging, and I eagerly anticipated immersing myself in the experience. However, my enthusiasm was short-lived. Upon launching the game, I was presented with a binary choice: affiliate with either the Republican or Democratic party. The absence of independent or third-party options was somewhat disheartening, but I chose to proceed, hoping to uncover more depth and complexity. One redeeming aspect of the game is its character customization feature, albeit limited in scope. This aspect allows for a degree of creativity, even permitting the unusual option of campaigning with or without one's head – a quirky touch that adds a hint of humor to the experience."
143,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"While I can appreciate the appeal of this game to others, it ultimately failed to resonate with me. As a Vive owner, I have a strong preference for immersive, room-scale experiences that leverage the full potential of motion controllers. Unfortunately, this game's vast universe, although initially breathtaking, proved to be a double-edged sword. The sheer scale of the environment and the complexity of its mechanics created a steep learning curve, which, combined with the lengthy time required to access engaging content, hindered my overall enjoyment. Had I possessed greater patience and a more extensive gaming schedule, I may have found this experience more compelling. However, with numerous other VR games vying for my attention, I found myself drawn to more accessible and immediately rewarding alternatives."

As a result, I was fortunate enough to avoid the initial issues that some players encountered. Despite its challenging early stages, I thoroughly enjoyed the game, finding it to be a truly rewarding experience when executed correctly. In contrast, my experience with XCOM2 has been overwhelmingly positive. The game runs smoothly on medium settings, even on my relatively outdated GTX560 with 2GB of VRAM. Initially, the game defaulted to high settings, resulting in some minor performance issues, but reducing the settings to medium resolved the problem entirely. It's possible that I've simply been fortunate in avoiding the issues that have plagued some players, but it's difficult not to notice that many of the negative reviews seem to stem from an unrealistic sense of entitlement."

By midnight on 1 February, the two automotive giants must come to a mutually agreeable solution, or Fiat will be entitled to offload its struggling car division to GM, as stipulated in their 2000 alliance agreement. However, GM, which is grappling with significant losses in its European operations, has grown increasingly reluctant to assume ownership of Fiat's unprofitable unit. The stalled negotiations have taken a toll on Fiat's stock, with shares plummeting 1.2% on Tuesday, following a 4% surge on Monday fueled by speculation of a potential payout. GM is reportedly offering a substantial $2 billion (£1.06 billion) to extricate itself from the arrangement, citing Fiat's decision to divest its finance arm and dilute GM's stake through a capital-raising initiative as grounds for voiding the original deal. The 2000 agreement was the culmination of a fierce bidding war between GM and DaimlerChrysler to secure a strategic partnership with Fiat."

The Cardinal's impassioned remarks, aired on BBC Radio 4, will be reiterated in his Christmas Midnight Mass, as he seizes the opportunity to reiterate his fervent opposition to the war. In a poignant Christmas message, Cardinal Murphy-O'Connor denounced the Iraq War as a ""terrible"" misallocation of funds, underscoring the tragic consequences of diverting vital resources away from the most vulnerable members of society. His sentiments echo those of the Archbishop of Canterbury, who has also spoken out against the war. The Cardinal's powerful plea, delivered during the 'Thought for the Day' segment on BBC Radio 4, served as a clarion call to action, urging the world to harness its collective energy to eradicate the debilitating spectres of poverty, malnutrition, and disease. As the world embarks on a new year, Cardinal Murphy-O'Connor has issued a rallying cry, proclaiming 2005 as a pivotal moment to galvanise global efforts and ""make history"" by vanquishing poverty."

This defiance comes as the Xiluodu Dam is one of 30 large-scale construction projects that have been instructed to cease operations due to inadequate environmental assessments. Rather than comply, the company may opt to pay a penalty, as reported by the Beijing News. Furthermore, the China Three Gorges Project Corp has also disregarded shutdown orders at two of its other sites: the Three Gorges underground power plant and the Three Gorges project electrical power supply plant.

The turning point came when Wayne Rooney expertly met Gary Neville's pinpoint cross at the near post, unleashing a low shot that deflected off Richard Dunne and found its way into the net. In a cruel twist of fate, Dunne's own misfortune continued just seven minutes later, as he inadvertently hooked a volley over the head of David James and into his own goal. Manchester City's best opportunity to level the score fell to Steve McManaman, who squandered a golden chance in the first half, shooting wide from a mere three yards out. Despite ultimately securing the crucial win, United's performance in the opening 45 minutes had been far from convincing, with their laboured approach play yielding only a single chance – a Paul Scholes header that sailed harmlessly over the bar."

190,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,news,"The Conservative Party has unveiled a groundbreaking proposal to revolutionize local policing, empowering communities to take a more active role in shaping law enforcement. Under this innovative plan, residents would be given the opportunity to elect their own area police commissioner, thereby fostering a more direct connection between the public and the policing authorities. This new role is designed to replace the existing, often invisible, police authorities, and would operate in tandem with the chief constable, rather than superseding their position.

However, the proposal has sparked intense debate, with the Liberal Democrats warning that it could potentially allow extremist groups to exert undue influence over policing. The Labour Party has also voiced concerns, criticizing the Conservative Party's ""extravagant"" promises on policing as unrealistic and lacking in substance.

Jan Berry, Chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, which represents the interests of rank-and-file officers, has expressed reservations about the plan, emphasizing the importance of maintaining operational independence. She cautioned that the proposed reforms could lead to policing becoming a ""political football,"" with those holding extreme views dictating policy on the ground.

However, the integrity of these evaluations is often compromised by the proliferation of fake reviews, also known as ""spams,"" orchestrated by sophisticated spammers who continually adapt and refine their tactics to evade detection. The ephemeral nature of these spamming strategies, which can shift rapidly over time, vary across spammers and targeted products, and often remain unknown, poses significant challenges to their capture. Moreover, traditional detection methods tend to prioritize accuracy over the ultimate goal of safeguarding the trustworthiness of product evaluations. To overcome these hurdles, we propose a novel approach based on a minimax game framework, where spammers and spam detectors engage in a competitive dynamic, driven by practical objectives that transcend mere detection accuracy. The Nash equilibria emerging from this game yield robust detectors that are resilient to diverse detection strategies, thereby ensuring the long-term reliability of online reviews."

By leveraging the Lewis-Riesenfeld method, we derived a comprehensive family of solutions that facilitate exact population transfer, each adhering to a single dynamical mode of the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant. Notably, we identified a tracking solution characterized by a single adjustable parameter, enabling simultaneous control over the fidelity of the transfer, the population of the excited state, and the robustness of the process. To quantify the robustness of ultra-high fidelity transfers, we introduced a metric based on the minimum percentile deviation in pulse areas at which the infidelity exceeds 10^-4. Our analysis reveals that the robustness of our optimally shaped pulses surpasses that of Gaussian and adiabatically optimized pulses, particularly for moderate pulse areas."
203,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,paper_abstract,"This study delves into the landscape of the population negative log-likelihood function of Gaussian mixture models, encompassing a variable number of components. Notably, the nonconvex nature of this function leads to the existence of multiple local minima that fail to achieve global optimality, even in scenarios where the mixture components are well-separated. A key finding of this research is that all local minima exhibit a common structural form, which partially reveals the locations of the true mixture components. Specifically, each local minimum involves a distinct combination of two phenomena: multiple Gaussians converging on a single true component, and a single Gaussian encompassing multiple true components. These results hold under a specific separation condition for the true mixture components and remain valid regardless of whether the number of components is over- or under-specified. Furthermore, in the context of three-component Gaussian mixtures, this study yields more refined insights into the interplay between the separation of components and the resulting landscape of the negative log-likelihood function."

Two approaches have been proposed to construct the mirror partner of this orbifold. The first, known as the Berglund-Hübsch-Krawitz (BHK) construction, involves a new weighted projective space and a hypersurface within it, quotiented by a dual group. In contrast, the Batyrev construction defines the mirror partner as a hypersurface in a toric variety, which is itself determined by a reflexive polytope dual to the polytope associated with the original orbifold.

A groundbreaking mixed variable symplectic (MVS) integrator has been developed to accurately model planetary systems, particularly those involving close encounters. By leveraging a time regularisation technique, this innovative method successfully maintains the stability properties inherent to symplectic integrators while adaptively reducing the effective step size during planetary interactions. This approach enables the utilisation of high-order MVS schemes, facilitating large time steps in regions far from close encounters. Notably, the algorithm demonstrates exceptional performance in resolving near-collision events, characterised by mutual separations of mere fractions of the physical radius, without compromising the time-step size typically employed in weakly perturbed systems, such as our solar system. The long-term behaviour of the integrator is showcased through simulations of six super-Earths undergoing intense scattering over a period of 50,000 years. Comparative analyses with hybrid methods, including the Mercury algorithm, reveal that the proposed MVS integrator achieves superior energy conservation at equivalent computational costs."
207,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,paper_abstract,"Entanglement is a fundamental component in quantum information processing, and its detection is crucial for harnessing its power. A widely employed method for identifying entanglement is through the use of entanglement witnesses, which are operators that yield non-negative measurement outcomes for all separable states, while potentially producing negative results for certain entangled states. However, constructing an efficient entanglement witness for general multipartite entangled systems poses significant challenges due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space dimension with respect to system size. In contrast, for a specific class of n-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-like states, a robust witness scheme has been developed, requiring n+1 local measurement settings and capable of withstanding up to 50% white noise contamination. Notably, a more efficient witness for GHZ-like states has also been proposed, necessitating only two local measurement settings and tolerating up to 33% white noise, thereby offering a more practical solution for entanglement detection in these systems."

This work introduces a novel methodology for extracting multipole moments from arbitrary stationary spacetimes, which is subsequently applied to a vast array of horizonless microstate geometries. Notably, these geometries can disrupt the axial and equatorial symmetries inherent to the Kerr metric, thereby exhibiting a far more intricate multipolar structure. This, in turn, offers a unique opportunity to phenomenologically constrain fuzzball models. Our analysis reveals compelling numerical evidence suggesting that the multipole moments of these geometries are generally more pronounced than those of a Kerr black hole with equivalent mass and spin. Presently, measurements of the quadrupole moment of black-hole candidates impose only modest constraints on fuzzball models. However, forthcoming gravitational-wave detections of extreme mass-ratio inspirals via the LISA space mission are poised to significantly enhance these bounds, yielding improvements of several orders of magnitude."

To address these limitations, we introduce a novel framework that leverages temporal point processes and variational autoencoders to infer temporal attention patterns between nodes based on observed communication dynamics. By harnessing the inherent dynamics of node interactions to learn this critical component, our approach offers enhanced flexibility while mitigating the drawbacks associated with human-defined edges, thereby providing a more robust and efficient solution for temporal graph analysis."

The PCW under investigation comprises two parallel nanobeams separated by a 240 nm vacuum gap, carefully designed to facilitate near-field atom trapping. To elucidate the interplay between the mechanical motion of the beams and the optical properties of the waveguide, sophisticated models have been developed and validated. These models accurately capture the transduction of beam motion into phase and amplitude modulation of a weak optical probe, propagating in a guided mode of the PCW, across a wide range of probe frequencies, including those near and far from the dielectric band edge. This research provides a crucial foundation for assessing the potential impact of thermal fluctuations on the stability of optical atomic traps in close proximity to PCW surfaces.

Notably, the restriction homomorphisms between these groups of consecutive dimensions admit natural splittings, yielding epimorphisms that are inherently split. This decomposition is of particular interest in the context of equivariant stable homotopy theory, where the equivariant stable homotopy groups of any global spectrum collectively form a global Mackey functor. Consequently, our splittings enable the disentanglement of intricate long exact homotopy group sequences into more manageable short exact sequences. Furthermore, when applied to the real and complex global Thom spectra, namely $\mathbf{mo}$ and $\mathbf{mu}$, these splittings reveal the regularity of various Euler classes that are intimately connected to the tautological representations of the orthogonal and unitary groups $o(n)$ and $u(n)$, respectively."

To address this issue, we have created a simulated tomographic dataset, akin to what is expected from Euclid, for the cosmic shear power spectrum and its associated covariance matrix. Notably, these datasets have been corrected to account for baryonic effects using the baryonification method developed by Schneider et al. (2019). Furthermore, we have designed an emulator capable of rapidly predicting the suppression of power due to baryonic effects, thereby enabling us to conduct a comprehensive likelihood inference analysis.

By acknowledging the existence of a true, albeit unknown, population structure, this approach enables the clustering problem to be framed within a conventional inferential framework. Here, the concept of ideal population clustering is rigorously defined as the partition that arises from the true density function. A nonparametric variant of this methodology, known as modal clustering, establishes a direct correspondence between clusters and the domains of attraction associated with density modes. The operationalization of this approach necessitates the estimation of a nonparametric density function, with the judicious selection of the smoothing parameter being crucial in shaping the density landscape and, by extension, the modal structure that underlies the final clustering partition. This study undertakes an asymptotic examination of density estimation in the context of modal clustering, with a focus on elucidating the theoretical foundations that govern this process."

However, the helicity selection rules governing diboson scattering amplitudes pose a significant challenge, as they effectively nullify the leading-order contributions from dimension-six operators, thereby obscuring the interference effects. Fortunately, a precise measurement of the azimuthal decay angles can revive these interference effects, restoring sensitivity to the otherwise elusive operators. A detailed examination of these signatures reveals that the uncertainties associated with higher-dimensional operators in the Effective Field Theory (EFT) framework can be remarkably suppressed through the construction of a bespoke asymmetry variable, which is exclusively generated by the non-interfering operators. This innovative approach effectively demotes the impact of higher-dimensional, interfering operators to the level of statistical fluctuations, thereby enhancing the discriminatory power of this observable."

By categorizing data science contributions into three distinct task classes – descriptive analytics, predictive modeling, and counterfactual prediction (encompassing causal inference) – we establish a framework for systematically addressing the data requirements, assumptions, and analytical methodologies essential to each task. A clear taxonomy of data science tasks is crucial for clarifying the interplay between data, assumptions, and analytics, and for highlighting the pivotal role of domain expertise in data analysis – a factor often overlooked, leading to widespread misconceptions about the data science discipline."
217,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,paper_abstract,"A fundamental principle in quantum gravity, the weak gravity conjecture, necessitates the presence of superextremal particles in any theoretically consistent framework. Conventionally, these particles are thought to play a crucial role in ensuring that extremal black holes exist in a state of instability or marginal stability. However, the underlying rationale for this requirement remains unclear. This analysis reveals that, within the context of a generic Einsteinian quantum theory of gravity in anti-de Sitter space, the exact stability of extremal black branes is inherently at odds with rigorously established quantum information theorems governing entanglement entropy. Resolving this paradox yields a nonperturbative formulation of the weak gravity conjecture, which converges to the conventional statement under weak coupling conditions. Notably, this argument is universally applicable, independent of supersymmetry or specific ultraviolet completions, and relies solely on the validity of Einsteinian gravity, effective field theory, and holographic principles."

Recently, ultracold two-dimensional Fermi gases have gained prominence as pristine and manipulable model systems, enabling the investigation of the intricate interplay between strong correlations and reduced dimensionality. However, empirical evidence of superfluidity in these systems has long been elusive. In this study, we provide definitive proof of superfluidity in an ultracold two-dimensional Fermi gas by introducing a periodic potential and observing the absence of dissipation at velocities below a critical threshold, v$_{\rm c}$. Furthermore, our measurements of v$_{\rm c}$ as a function of interaction strength reveal a pronounced maximum in the crossover regime, where bosonic and fermionic superfluidity converge. This breakthrough establishes ultracold Fermi gases as a versatile and powerful platform for exploring the profound impact of reduced dimensionality on strongly correlated superfluids."

Furthermore, our analysis reveals the significant impact of a chiral chemical potential, arising from the electron population imbalance between Weyl nodes of opposing chirality, on the junction's transport characteristics. A striking observation is the emergence of a net spin polarization in Cooper pairs generated through Andreev reflection in the two Weyl semimetal regions, with the polarization being oppositely directed in each region and exhibiting high sensitivity to both the chirality imbalance and excitation energy."
221,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,paper_abstract,"A novel approach to modifying the surface electrical conductivity of ceramics has been successfully demonstrated through metal ion implantation, a technique that has been effectively utilized in various applications. Notably, this method enables the precise control of voltage distribution across high-voltage insulators, thereby significantly enhancing their operational voltage capacity without compromising their integrity through surface flashover. However, a critical consideration in the implementation of this technique is the long-term stability of the conductivity induced by metal ion implantation, particularly when the implanted metal species is prone to oxidation. This study presents an in-depth examination of the long-term behavior of titanium-implanted alumina, revealing that while an initial decline of up to 40% in conductivity occurs within the first few weeks following implantation, the subsequent decrease is remarkably gradual, with a mere 10% reduction observed over the ensuing year."
222,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,paper_abstract,"A novel, conserved current is introduced within the framework of an effective theory encompassing pions and vector mesons, grounded in the concept of hidden local symmetry. This current's associated charge is demonstrated to be equivalent to the skyrmion charge for all smooth configurations, while singular configurations can be identified as baryons with n_f=1, exhibiting charge under the newly proposed symmetry. Notably, vector mesons assume the role of Chern-Simons vector fields residing on the quantum Hall droplet that constitutes the n_f=1 baryon. We propose that this current provides the accurate effective representation of the baryon current at low energies, thereby offering a unified paradigm for the two distinct types of baryons. This unified framework enables a seamless transformation between the two baryon types, while Chern-Simons dualities on the droplet can be interpreted as a manifestation of Seiberg-like duality between gluons and vector mesons, fostering a deeper understanding of the intricate relationships between these fundamental particles."
223,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,paper_abstract,"The convergence of interfacial spin-orbit coupling and Josephson physics in a single device presents a fascinating paradigm, enabling the integration of anomalous Hall and Josephson effects in superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator/superconductor junctions. Our theoretical investigation delves into the interplay between these phenomena, revealing a profound impact on the transport properties of such junctions. The transverse momentum-dependent skew tunneling of Cooper pairs across the spin-active ferromagnetic insulator interface generates substantial transverse Hall supercurrents, which we term anomalous Josephson Hall effect currents. By extending the Furusaki-Tsukada formula, originally developed to quantify conventional Josephson current flows, we demonstrate the ability to evaluate and modulate the transverse current components through the spin-orbit coupling strengths or the superconducting phase difference across the junction. Notably, the formation of well-localized subgap bound states around the interface serves as a distinct spectroscopic signature of Josephson junctions, offering a unique probe into the underlying physics."
224,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,paper_abstract,"A recent study inspired by Monte Carlo experiments (Jiménez, Journal of Turbulence, 2020) reveals that dipoles play a crucial role in the dynamics of decaying two-dimensional turbulence, rivaling the importance of individual vortex cores. Notably, the kinetic energy of this flow is predominantly carried by elongated streams formed through the concatenation of dipoles. The vortices in this system undergo a bifurcation, separating into two distinct families: small, rapidly moving cores and larger, slowly moving ones that become 'frozen' into a slowly evolving, crystalline structure. The kinematic properties of these two families exhibit stark differences, with only the smaller, faster-moving vortices displaying self-similarity. Conversely, the larger, slower-moving vortices are responsible for the majority of the flow's kinetic energy and are the primary constituents of the dipoles and streams. The underlying mechanisms driving the growth of this slow-moving component are explored in detail."
225,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,paper_abstract,"The continuous-time quantum walk framework has emerged as a powerful paradigm for designing a wide range of quantum algorithms, with the quantum hitting time serving as a key metric for evaluating their efficiency. This metric represents the time required for a quantum walk to locate a target vertex with high probability. This article presents significant advancements in the field by establishing improved upper bounds for the quantum hitting time, thereby enhancing the performance of various quantum algorithms based on continuous-time quantum walks. Notably, our techniques yield a substantial improvement in the hitting time upper bound for the glued-trees problem, reducing it from a quintic to a nearly quadratic dependence on the problem size, specifically from O(n^5) to O(n^2 log n). Moreover, our methods also enable an exponential reduction in the precision dependence of the continuous-time quantum walk-based algorithm for finding a marked node on any ergodic, reversible Markov chain, as originally proposed by Chakraborty et al."
226,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,paper_abstract,"Extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) can be broadly categorized into two distinct types based on their formation mechanisms: dry EMRIs and wet EMRIs. Traditionally, dry EMRIs, also known as ""loss-cone"" EMRIs, were considered the primary source of EMRIs detectable by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. These dry EMRIs are primarily formed through the complex interplay of multi-body scattering within the nuclear star cluster and gravitational capture. However, this letter sheds light on an alternative, yet significant, EMRI formation pathway: the assisted formation of wet EMRIs facilitated by the accretion flow surrounding accreting massive black holes (MBHs) at galactic centers. In this scenario, the accretion disk captures stellar-mass black holes that are initially on inclined orbits, and subsequently, through a process of orbital migration, drives them towards the MBH, thereby dramatically enhancing the formation rate of EMRIs in these galaxies by several orders of magnitude."
227,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,paper_abstract,"Upon initial registration, a new user typically lacks a digital footprint on a website, characterized by an absence of interactions with items, a non-existent user profile, and no established social connections with other users. Despite this void of information, it is crucial for recommender systems to captivate these users from the outset, encouraging them to remain on the platform and evolve into active participants. This challenge falls under the category of new user cold-start, a critical issue that can significantly impact a company's growth and sustainability. Current approaches to addressing user cold-start recommendations often necessitate additional user engagement, such as participating in an interview process, or rely on supplementary information, including demographic data, geographical location, and social relationships. However, users may be reluctant to invest time in such processes, and supplementary information is frequently unavailable for cold-start users, rendering these approaches ineffective."
228,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,paper_abstract,"Deep learning has revolutionized the field of problem-solving, tackling complex challenges that were previously insurmountable for heuristic algorithms. Notably, its successful application in wireless communications has yielded significant benefits, even in areas where existing radio systems are well-established and optimal algorithms are readily available. While learning individual components of a receiver has led to some improvements, a more effective approach involves jointly learning the entire receiver pipeline. However, this holistic approach often gives rise to a formidable nonlinear problem, whose optimal solution is impractical to implement. To address this challenge, we introduce Deeprx, a novel deep fully convolutional neural network that seamlessly integrates the entire receiver pipeline, from frequency domain signal processing to uncoded bit extraction, in a manner compliant with 5G standards. By carefully crafting the input to the convolutional neural network using a combination of data and pilot symbols, we enable accurate channel estimation, thereby enhancing the overall performance of the receiver."
229,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,paper_abstract,"Optimizing Mutation-Based Fuzzing through Corpus Distillation: A Systematic Exploration

Mutation-based fuzzing relies on an initial corpus of non-crashing seed inputs to generate new test cases through iterative mutation. However, the sheer volume of similar inputs within this corpus can lead to redundant fuzzing efforts, as exhaustive mutation from all available seeds can result in wasted computational resources. To mitigate this issue, distillation tools have been developed to identify the smallest subset of seeds that can effectively trigger the same range of instrumentation data points as the full corpus. Conventional wisdom suggests that minimizing the number and cumulative size of seeds can significantly enhance fuzzing efficiency. To validate this hypothesis, we conducted an extensive study involving over 34 CPU-years of fuzzing, employing five distinct distillation approaches to assess their efficacy in uncovering bugs in real-world software applications."
230,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,paper_abstract,"This study explores the realm of multi-agent discrete-event systems, where agents operate under partial observation and can be categorized into distinct groups based on their isomorphic state transition structures. By leveraging this template-based approach, a novel, scalable supervisory framework is developed, which decouples the state size and computational complexity from the number of agents involved. Notably, this framework remains invariant to changes in the agent population, eliminating the need for recalibration when agents are added or removed. Building upon previous research, this work extends the existing results to accommodate partial observation, introducing necessary conditions for ensuring safety and maximal permissiveness in the scalable, least restrictive supervisor. A comprehensive example is provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed supervisory synthesis methodology."

This paper presents an innovative approach to ENF estimation, harnessing the filter-bank Capon spectral estimator in conjunction with temporal windowing techniques. By exploiting the Toeplitz structure inherent in the model covariance matrix, a specialized Gohberg-Semencul factorization is employed, thereby facilitating efficient computation. Notably, this methodology pioneers the use of non-rectangular temporal windows in the pre-spectral estimation stage, a departure from conventional approaches in ENF analysis. Furthermore, the incorporation of Krylov matrices enables rapid matrix inversion, significantly enhancing computational efficiency. The proposed framework demonstrates superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods in ENF estimation, particularly when applied to power recordings with a short time window of 1 second. Additionally, in the context of speech recordings, this approach yields remarkably accurate results, striking a balance between computational complexity and precision."

This study focuses on the anomalous saturation behavior of nitrogen vacancy defects in diamond, a phenomenon that has garnered considerable attention in recent years. Notably, our experiments revealed a pronounced reduction in fluorescence emission when subjected to high-power laser excitation, which in turn amplified the nonlinearity of the fluorescence signal and altered the spatial frequency distribution of the resulting fluorescence image. To extract high spatial frequency information, we employed a differential excitation protocol that involved modulating the power of the excitation laser. This approach yielded a substantial improvement in spatial resolution, with an approximate 1.6-fold enhancement compared to conventional confocal microscopy. Given the relative simplicity of the experimental setup and data processing requirements, we anticipate that this method will have far-reaching implications for enhancing the spatial resolution of sensing and biological labeling applications that utilize defects in solid-state materials."
234,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,paper_abstract,"In the presence of correlations between random effects and sample design variables, traditional survey weighting methods, which rely on individual survey weights inversely proportional to unit inclusion probabilities, can lead to biased inferences. To address this limitation, we propose a novel weight-exponentiated formulation for the random effects distribution, enabling unbiased estimation of hyperparameters. A comparative analysis with frequentist approaches, which often rely on numerical integration, reveals that our Bayesian method uniquely achieves unbiased estimation with respect to the sampling design distribution, while maintaining consistency with the population-generating distribution. Through comprehensive simulations and a real-world example involving a survey of business establishments, we demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of our approach across diverse modeling formulations and sampling designs. This research serves as a culmination of recent efforts to integrate traditional survey estimation techniques with Bayesian modeling, bridging the gap between these two distinct yet complementary fields."

Unlike graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, and transition metal dichalcogenides, which exhibit the characteristic honeycomb lattice structure, these emerging materials possess intricate atomistic arrangements that deviate from high symmetry. This reduced symmetry gives rise to a rich tapestry of inhomogeneous responses, encompassing electron, optical, valley, and spin phenomena, as well as novel properties such as ferroelasticity, ferroelectricity, magnetism, and superconductivity. Furthermore, the unique structural characteristics of these materials enable the emergence of nonlinear optical properties, spin-wave phenomena, photogalvanic effects, and large nonlinear elastic responses. The interplay between low symmetry and anisotropy also facilitates the manifestation of novel electronic topological properties, nonlinear elastic behavior, and structural phase transformations. In recognition of the burgeoning interest in these materials, the special topic ""Beyond Graphene: Low-Symmetry and Anisotropic 2D Materials"" has been curated to showcase the latest experimental and theoretical advances in this rapidly evolving field."
236,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,paper_abstract,"A comprehensive investigation into the orientational dynamics of a comb-shaped nematic polymer, featuring both mesogenic and functional side groups, was conducted in its isotropic phase using a combination of Kerr effect and dielectric spectroscopy techniques. Notably, this study revealed a significant departure from the behavior of low-molecular-weight mesogens, as the relaxation of electric birefringence in the polymer melt above the nematic-isotropic phase transition temperature could be accurately described by a multi-exponential decay process, with two dominant relaxation mechanisms playing a crucial role. These primary processes exhibit a temperature-dependent crossover, occurring within a range of approximately 50 degrees. Furthermore, dielectric spectroscopy enabled the identification of two distinct orientational relaxation processes: one attributed to the rotational motion of the side mesogenic groups, and the other associated with the movement of main chain segments."
237,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,paper_abstract,"Deep hashing techniques have revolutionized large-scale image retrieval, boasting impressive accuracy and efficiency. However, a long-standing challenge in these methods is the optimization of discrete hash bits. A prevalent approach involves employing activation functions, such as sigmoid or tanh, and minimizing quantization loss to approximate discrete values. Nevertheless, this paradigm can lead to a significant issue, where an increasing number of hash bits become trapped in the saturated regions of the activation functions, never to escape. This phenomenon, which we term the ""dead bits problem"" (dbp), is further exacerbated by existing quantization loss functions. To address this issue, we introduce a novel gradient amplifier that precedes activation functions, effectively mitigating the dead bits problem and enhancing the overall performance of deep hashing methods."
238,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,paper_abstract,"A comprehensive analysis of the phenomenological implications of a hypercharge-zero SU(2) triplet scalar is presented, driven by the theoretical framework of two-step electroweak symmetry-breaking. Two distinct scenarios are explored: the first, where the triplet scalar is stable and contributes to the dark matter relic density, and the second, where it decays through mixing with the Standard Model Higgs boson. The stable triplet scenario is subject to stringent constraints from disappearing charged track searches at the Large Hadron Collider and direct detection experiments, while the decaying triplet scenario is constrained by existing multilepton searches at colliders. Our findings indicate that a two-step electroweak phase transition involving a stable triplet scalar with a negative quadratic term is incompatible with direct detection searches, whereas an unstable triplet scalar with a mass below 230 GeV is excluded at a 95% confidence level, thereby providing significant insights into the viability of this theoretical framework."
239,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,paper_abstract,"Recent observations of the stars Fomalhaut and HD 202628 have revealed eccentric debris rings that defy expectations under the conventional eccentric planet perturbation model, also known as the ""pericenter glow"" hypothesis. This standard framework assumes that an initially circular and narrow planetesimal belt, located at a semi-major axis a, undergoes a gradual increase in eccentricity to e_f following the dispersal of the gas disc, driven by secular perturbations from an eccentric planet. This process would theoretically yield a belt with a width of 2ae_f. However, a nuanced variation of this scenario suggests that narrower belts can emerge if the planetesimals possess an inherent eccentricity, potentially inherited from earlier planetary perturbations during the gas-rich protoplanetary disc phase. Alternatively, primordial eccentricity could be the result of disc instabilities that amplify eccentricity, eliminating the need for planetary intervention altogether."
240,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,paper_abstract,"Electrons are conventionally regarded as possessing a single form of kinetic energy, but the possibility of multiple forms arising from their spin, charge, or interactions with other electrons warrants exploration. In one-dimensional systems, the Tomonaga-Luttinger-Liquid (TLL) model effectively captures the physics of interacting electrons at low energies, yet experimental observations have been limited to this linear regime. Our research presents a breakthrough in this area, utilizing tunnelling spectroscopy to investigate many-body modes in one-dimensional gated wires. Notably, our findings reveal the coexistence of two distinct Fermi seas at high energies, corresponding to spin and charge excitations, alongside the emergence of three additional one-dimensional 'replica' modes that intensify as the wire length decreases. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability to modulate the effective interaction strength within the wires by adjusting the degree of one-dimensional inter-subband screening, achieving a variation of over 45%."

It is probable that the formation of our galaxy's globular cluster system followed a similarly intricate and multifaceted path. To elucidate this process, we investigate the connection between the globular clusters and the known major mergers that have shaped the Milky Way. By combining Gaia's comprehensive kinematic data for nearly all galactic clusters with the largest available sample of cluster ages, carefully corrected for systematic biases, we analyzed the dynamical properties of these clusters, particularly in the context of their integrals of motion. Our findings indicate that approximately 40% of the clusters likely originated within the Milky Way itself, providing valuable insights into the galaxy's formative history."

To facilitate seamless integration into existing workflows, 'intrinsic' provides an intuitive interface, comprising high-level functions that leverage a robust set of low-level routines optimized for efficiency. The package's estimators are categorized into two distinct groups: homogeneous and heterogeneous intrinsic dimension estimators.

A striking phenomenon has been observed in the context of popularity-driven rankings, where a smaller number of items signaling a particular attribute collectively garner a disproportionately large share of overall traffic. This ""few-get-richer"" phenomenon manifests in environments characterized by a limited number of distinct item categories, such as polarized news sources, where items are ranked according to their popularity. Through analytical modeling, we establish that this effect arises when users exhibit a propensity to engage with top-ranked items and display heterogeneous preferences for different item categories. We employ simulation-based analyses to investigate how the magnitude of this effect varies in response to changes in environmental assumptions and human behavior. Furthermore, we validate our theoretical predictions through a controlled online experiment involving human participants. The findings of this study have significant implications for understanding the dynamics of misinformation dissemination in online ecosystems."

To mitigate this issue, constructing a more comparable control group by matching a subset of the overall control group to the treatment group can potentially reduce bias. This phenomenon is explored through simulation studies. A case in point is our investigation into the impact of mountaintop removal mining on mortality rates, utilizing a difference-in-differences analysis that leverages the surge in mountaintop removal mining activities following the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments. By creating a more closely matched control group for this analysis, our results yielded a 95% confidence interval that encompasses a range of possible effects, including substantial adverse outcomes, no discernible impact, and minor beneficial effects, thereby underscoring the complexity of the relationship between mountaintop removal mining and mortality rates."

One, a marvel of modern engineering, comprises thousands of intricately assembled steel components, while the other, a masterpiece of organic elegance, is crafted from a single, unbroken silk thread.

The former is a product of human ingenuity, carefully designed to coexist with nature, whereas the latter is an expression of nature's inherent design, shaped by its own intrinsic forces.

This dichotomy is reminiscent of Michelangelo's profound observation that, when gazing upon unshaped marble, he envisioned a figure yearning to be liberated. The renowned artist's chisel was the instrument that freed the captive form, but living organisms defy such rigid manipulation. Instead, they grow and evolve, their cells carrying the genetic blueprint that governs their function, replication, and intricate interconnectedness.

268,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"As I reflect on my unconventional career path, I am reminded of the unorthodox profession that sustained me for nearly five years after graduating from a prestigious liberal arts university. My day job was that of a self-employed living statue, a role that never fails to spark curiosity and amusement when I share it with others. I affectionately refer to myself as the Eight-Foot Bride, a moniker that has become a cherished part of my personal narrative. To assume this persona, I would meticulously paint my skin a brilliant white, ascend a pedestal, and place a hat or can at my feet to collect donations from passersby. Whenever someone would approach and contribute to my makeshift tip jar, I would reward them with a delicate flower and a piercing gaze that seemed to convey a deep sense of connection. However, if they chose to decline my offering, I would respond with a dramatic flourish of sadness and longing, a gesture that would linger in their minds as they walked away."
269,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"October 4, 1957, marked a pivotal moment in history as the Soviet Union successfully launched Sputnik, the world's inaugural artificial satellite, into the vast expanse of space. This diminutive, metallic orb, measuring less than two feet in diameter, ignited a fierce space race between the United States and the Soviet Union, a rivalry that would span nearly two decades and irrevocably alter the global landscape. Although Sputnik was the first satellite to be launched into space, it was not the first human-made object to breach the Earth's atmosphere. That distinction belongs to the V-2 rocket, employed by Germany in a desperate bid to launch missile attacks against Allied cities during the waning years of World War II. Despite its limited effectiveness, the V-2 rocket's technology and the scientists behind its development were seized by both the United States and the Soviet Union, who subsequently repurposed them to fuel their own ambitious projects, laying the groundwork for the impending space age."
270,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"As a connoisseur of diverse cultural experiences, my daily commute is elevated by the eclectic mix of music on my iPod, which seamlessly blends the classical masterpieces of Wagner and Mozart with the contemporary sounds of pop sensation Christina Aguilera, country crooner Josh Turner, and the genre-bending Kirk Franklin. My musical tastes are merely a reflection of my voracious appetite for literature, which spans the literary spectrum from the nuanced prose of Ian McEwan to the captivating storytelling of Stephanie Meyer, including her iconic Twilight series. When I'm not immersed in the written word, I indulge in the cinematic delights of my home theater, where I devour a wide range of DVDs, video on demand, and television shows. My viewing preferences are equally eclectic, encompassing the gripping drama of ""Law & Order: SVU,"" the witty humor of Tina Fey's ""30 Rock,"" and the unscripted drama of ""Judge Judy,"" where the authenticity of the cases and the finality of the rulings are a constant reminder of the complexities of real life."
271,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"In a world united by a shared destiny, we stand at the precipice of an existential threat of unparalleled proportions. As the clock ticks away, the international community is poised to receive a critical message from the Secretary-General of the United Nations, António Guterres.

The climate emergency has emerged as the defining challenge of our era, with the world engaged in a desperate sprint against time. Unfortunately, we are currently lagging behind, and the consequences of inaction are becoming increasingly apparent. A growing sense of frustration, particularly among the younger generation, is palpable, as the global response to this crisis continues to fall short of expectations.

It is imperative that we collectively raise our level of ambition, with governments, cities, corporations, investors, and individuals from all walks of life contributing to a unified effort. In this context, the launch of TED Countdown is a timely and welcome initiative. By harnessing the power of your influence and innovative ideas, we can accelerate the momentum towards a carbon-neutral world by 2050 – the only viable pathway to mitigating the most catastrophic effects of global warming.

The necessary tools, scientific expertise, and resources are already at our disposal. What is required now is the unwavering commitment of our collective political will and unrelenting energy to drive meaningful change and secure a sustainable future for generations to come."
272,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"Menstruation, a fundamental aspect of human biology, has been shrouded in centuries of silence and shame, forcing it into the realm of hushed conversations. Yet, as we speak, over 800 million women worldwide are experiencing this natural phenomenon, a crucial precursor to the very existence of humanity. Paradoxically, the subject remains a source of discomfort, a taboo that persists despite its universality. Drawing from personal experiences and those of women around me, I can attest to the draining nature of this reality. The constant need for secrecy is exhausting – carefully concealing sanitary products in brown paper bags, furtively slipping them into pockets during classes, and making surreptitious trips to the restroom. The charade of normalcy is equally draining, as one struggles to maintain a composed exterior while internally grappling with debilitating menstrual cramps, all in an effort to avoid drawing attention to a perfectly natural process."
273,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"Deep within the vast expanse of Canada's boreal forest, the world's largest and most pristine wilderness, lies a colossal environmental and industrial endeavor. Spanning the breadth of northern Canada, this region is home to the Labrador wilderness, where the majestic George River caribou herd roams free. As one of the last remaining wild caribou herds, it boasts an impressive population of approximately 400,000 animals. Although a personal encounter with these magnificent creatures proved elusive, the presence of their antlers serves as a poignant reminder of their existence. The boreal forest is also blessed with an astonishing array of wetlands, ecosystems that are not only globally endangered but also crucial for maintaining ecological balance. These wetlands play a vital role in purifying the air and water, sequestering substantial amounts of greenhouse gases, and providing a habitat for a diverse array of species, underscoring their importance in the grand tapestry of our planet's ecosystem."
275,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"Upon completing my dual degree in molecular and cell biology and linguistics from the University of California, Berkeley, seven years prior, I attended a campus career fair that led to an interview with a startup called Theranos. At the time, information about the company was scarce, but what was available was undeniably impressive. Theranos was pioneering a revolutionary medical device that enabled comprehensive blood panel analysis from a mere finger-stick sample, eliminating the need for invasive venipuncture. This innovation not only promised a more comfortable experience for patients but also held the potential to unlock the doors to predictive diagnostics, a groundbreaking prospect that sparked my interest."
276,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"My odyssey as a polar specialist and photographer began at the tender age of four, when my family embarked on a life-changing journey from southern Canada to the remote northern reaches of Baffin Island, nestled near the icy shores of Greenland. It was there, in a small Inuit community of 200 residents, that we became one of only three non-Inuit families, fully immersed in the local culture. Devoid of modern distractions such as television, computers, and even telephones, I spent my formative years exploring the vast expanse of snow and ice, with the Inuit as my guides and mentors. This unfettered access to the harsh yet majestic polar environment ignited a deep-seated passion within me, setting the stage for a lifelong fascination with the polar regions."

To fully appreciate this remarkable feat, let's delve into the origins of our solar system. Approximately 4.5 billion years ago, a vast cloud of gas and dust coalesced, giving rise to our sun at its center. As the sun ignited, the planets, comets, and asteroids we know today began to take shape. According to scientific theory, as the Earth cooled following its formation, comets collided with our planet, delivering water and potentially complex organic materials that may have played a pivotal role in sparking the emergence of life on Earth."
279,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"Chris Anderson: Welcome back to the TED community for another live conversation, one that promises to be a pivotal moment in our collective journey. As we launched the 'Build Back Better' series, our primary objective was to explore ways to address the challenges that have arisen in the wake of the pandemic and to reimagine a more resilient future. However, the tragic events of the past week, including the devastating loss of George Floyd and the subsequent wave of protests, have injected a sense of urgency that demands our immediate attention. As we grapple with the question of whether we can truly build back better from this moment, it's essential that we first seek to comprehend the profound magnitude of this crisis. Whitney Pennington Rodgers: Indeed, Chris."
280,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"In the summer of 1903, a pivotal moment in American conservation history unfolded in California's breathtaking Yosemite Valley, as President Theodore Roosevelt embarked on a three-day camping excursion. Under the majestic canopy of towering sequoia trees, Roosevelt immersed himself in the unspoiled beauty of nature, braving a snowstorm and engaging in profound conversations with his host, the renowned conservationist John Muir, around the warm glow of the campfire. While Roosevelt's affinity for the outdoors was well-documented, Muir's invitation extended far beyond a leisurely camping trip – it was a call to action, as Yosemite teetered on the brink of destruction. Despite being designated as protected land in 1864, the valley remained vulnerable to the threats of overdevelopment in 1903, caught in the midst of a decades-long struggle to strike a delicate balance between preservation and public access – a challenge that proved far more daunting than it seemed. The seeds of this contentious battle were sown during the 1849 gold rush, when a surge of prospectors flocked to the Sierra Nevada foothills, setting in motion a chain of events that would ultimately determine the fate of Yosemite."
282,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"For my own protection, I must remain anonymous, as revealing my identity would put me in grave danger at the hands of those who seek to silence me. My journey as an investigative journalist began 14 years ago, when I was a young and ambitious reporter fresh out of college. It was then that I stumbled upon a story that would change the course of my career. The scoop was deceptively simple: police officers were accepting bribes from street vendors in exchange for turning a blind eye to their illicit activities. However, I knew that simply reporting the facts wouldn't be enough to spark meaningful change, as the practice was already widely known and yet remained deeply entrenched in the system. To maximize the impact of my story, I decided to employ a more unconventional approach. I went undercover, posing as a street vendor myself, and was able to gather irrefutable evidence of the corruption. The response was overwhelming, and my exposé sent shockwaves through the community. This was my introduction to the world of immersion journalism, a style of reporting that involves embedding oneself in the story to uncover the truth."
283,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"Sensational health headlines have become a daily staple, often presenting conflicting claims that can be misleading and confusing. The disconnect between attention-grabbing headlines and the nuanced findings of the underlying medical research can be significant. To critically evaluate the credibility of such headlines, it is essential to examine the original research they are based on. To illustrate this, let's consider three hypothetical research scenarios, each corresponding to a commonly encountered type of headline. By analyzing these examples, we can develop a more informed approach to assessing the validity of health-related news stories."
284,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"My journey to understanding the significance of birth certificates in international development began 20 years ago, when my family was in the process of adopting my two younger brothers from Ethiopia. A seemingly innocuous question posed by my mother sparked a profound realization: ""What date should we use as their birthday?"" My initial response, ""the day they were born, of course,"" was met with a sobering reality check. My mother explained that neither of my brothers possessed a birth certificate, rendering their exact birthdates unknown. This revelation had a profound impact on me, and it has since evolved into a lifelong pursuit to address the global issue of missing birth certificates. Today, I am driven to explore the critical role that birth certificates play in international development, and to find innovative solutions to this complex problem."
285,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"Envision a world where technology has advanced to the point of creating a neural interface that seamlessly integrates with the human brain, generating an existence of unadulterated bliss. This hypothetical scenario, conceived by philosopher Robert Nozick, presents a profound dilemma: would you opt for a life of unparalleled pleasure, knowing that it would come at the cost of relinquishing your connection to reality? The Experience Machine, as Nozick termed it, is a thought-provoking concept that challenges our perceptions of the human experience. In this simulated realm, scientists have perfected a system that replicates the intricacies of real life, yet scrupulously eliminates any semblance of pain or discomfort. The trade-off, however, is absolute: in exchange for this idyllic existence, one must irrevocably sever ties with the world as we know it. The simulated experiences would be so convincingly authentic that the boundaries between reality and fantasy would become increasingly blurred. The inherent ebbs and flows of life would be supplanted by an endless succession of euphoric moments, raising a fundamental question: is a life of unmitigated pleasure truly desirable, or does the human experience rely on the interplay of contrasting emotions to be truly fulfilling?"
286,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"One of the most mortifying experiences of my career as a palliative care physician occurred a few years ago, when I was consulted to evaluate a retired English professor in her 70s, who was battling pancreatic cancer. Her symptoms were multifaceted, encompassing debilitating pain, persistent nausea, and intractable vomiting. As I engaged with her during our consultation, she inquired about the potential therapeutic benefits of medical marijuana in alleviating her distressing symptoms. I was taken aback, as my medical school education had not equipped me with any substantial knowledge on the subject, a glaring omission that left me feeling woefully unprepared to provide a well-informed response."

As a member of this esteemed team, our mission is to protect and preserve the lives and property of our community from a wide range of catastrophic events, including devastating car accidents, raging house fires, and life-threatening medical emergencies. As a female leader in a traditionally male-dominated field, I have consistently sought opportunities to expand my expertise and enhance my ability to serve. Ten years ago, I made the strategic decision to pursue a nursing degree, driven by the growing realization that the most pressing threats facing not only my city, but also communities nationwide, were no longer confined to singular, dramatic events that could be swiftly addressed and resolved. Instead, I recognized that the next wave of challenges would be more complex, more insidious, and more far-reaching, requiring a more nuanced and multifaceted approach to emergency response and community care."
288,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"The Earth's carbon cycle is a complex, interconnected system that governs the flow of carbon through our planet's ecosystems. This essential element is omnipresent, found in every living organism, from the soil beneath our feet to the oceans that cover most of our globe, and from the atmosphere that surrounds us to the rocks that lie deep beneath the Earth's surface. As plants and other organisms reach the end of their life cycle, a significant portion of their stored carbon is released back into the atmosphere, only to be reabsorbed by new generations of flora. However, over the course of millions of years, a small fraction of this carbon becomes sequestered in the form of rock, while another portion is transformed into fossil fuels, including coal, oil, and natural gas. The Earth's geological processes, such as volcanic eruptions, periodically release some of this ancient, trapped carbon back into the atmosphere. Meanwhile, human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, have become a dominant force in releasing prehistoric carbon into the atmosphere, with our annual emissions now exceeding those of all the world's volcanoes by a staggering factor of 60."

This phenomenon bears some resemblance to the achievements of industry giants like Microsoft and Google, albeit in a distinctly unconventional manner. Notably, it has defied the current recession with remarkable resilience. I am, of course, referring to the realm of organized crime. While it's true that organized crime has a long and storied history, its recent trajectory is nothing short of astonishing. Over the past two decades, it has undergone an unprecedented period of expansion, now accounting for a staggering 15% of the world's GDP. I've come to think of this vast, clandestine network as the ""Global Shadow Economy"" or, more colloquially, ""McMafia."" So, what sparked this extraordinary surge in transnational crime?"
293,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"As I gaze into the mirror today, I am met with the reflection of a multifaceted individual: a scholar of justice and education at Columbia University, a dedicated youth mentor, a passionate activist, and a future leader in the New York State Senate. The applause of my accomplishments echoes in my mind, yet I am also reminded of a more tumultuous past – one that was marked by a six-year stint in state prison, beginning on Rikers Island as a teenager, for a crime that had devastating consequences. However, it was not the punitive measures I faced in the unforgiving adult prison system that transformed my life. Rather, it was the transformative power of education that set me on a path towards redemption. A pivotal moment arrived just weeks before my parole release, when a counselor urged me to enroll in a groundbreaking college course being offered within the prison walls – an opportunity that would forever alter my perception of what was possible, not only for myself, but for the justice system as a whole."
294,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"As I stand before you, I wonder what thoughts cross your mind. Do you see a woman of unwavering faith, a knowledgeable expert, or perhaps a kindred spirit? Or do you perceive me as oppressed, brainwashed, or even a threat to society? Maybe, in a more mundane sense, you associate me with the frustration of a delayed airport security line – a notion that, I must confess, holds a grain of truth. If some of your initial impressions were less than favorable, I don't hold it against you. The media has, after all, played a significant role in shaping these perceptions, with a staggering 80 percent of news coverage about Islam and Muslims being decidedly negative. It's no surprise, then, that many Americans admit to not knowing a Muslim personally. I often joke that perhaps they just don't engage in conversation with their Uber drivers. To those of you who have never had the opportunity to meet a Muslim, I'm delighted to make your acquaintance."
295,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"Establishing a comprehensive weather service for water is imperative, but it will only become a reality when we collectively demand accountability and drive the necessary investment. My journey to address this issue began eight years ago, when I first took the stage at TED, fresh out of graduate school. At the time, I was unaware that my brief presentation would set the tone for the questions I would be grappling with for the next decade. Like many young idealists, I was convinced that I could single-handedly solve the world's water problems through technological innovation. However, I soon discovered that the reality was far more complex. I had initially been misled into believing that the persistence of water quality issues was primarily due to the difficulty in identifying them. I assumed that the solution lay in developing simpler, faster, and more affordable sensors. This assumption proved to be misguided, and I have since come to realize that the challenges we face are far more nuanced."

My profession had become an integral part of my life, allowing me to develop a profound understanding of the global economy. I was well-versed in a wide range of topics, from ecological concerns to the potential consequences of global catastrophes. However, despite my extensive knowledge, I must admit that I was skeptical about the severity of these issues. That was until 2007, when the subprime crisis struck, sending shockwaves through the financial sector and culminating in the collapse of several major American banks. This unprecedented event served as a wake-up call, prompting me to reevaluate my career and the limitations of the financial models I had long relied on. The crisis sparked heated debates with my wife, as I began to realize that my previous convictions were misguided, and that we were, in fact, on a catastrophic trajectory."
297,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"The capacity for human communication is a remarkable phenomenon, one that enables us to convey intricate ideas and thoughts to one another with remarkable precision. This extraordinary ability is rooted in our unique capacity for language, which allows us to encode complex concepts into a series of sounds, tones, and vibrations that can be transmitted through the air. As I speak, my vocalizations create a cascade of pressure waves that propagate through the atmosphere, eventually reaching your ears and triggering a response in your brain. This process, known as auditory perception, enables your brain to decode the vibrations and interpret them as meaningful thoughts and ideas. Through this remarkable process, we are able to transcend spatial and temporal boundaries, sharing knowledge and ideas across vast distances and bridging the gaps between individual minds."

It is a profound privilege for a politician to be invited to deliver a TED Talk, especially in the UK, where the reputation of politics has been severely tarnished by the expenses scandal. The public's perception of politicians has sunk to an all-time low, with some even joking that scientists have considered replacing laboratory rats with politicians, citing an abundance of willing participants, a general apathy towards their well-being, and a certain reluctance on the part of rats to engage in unscrupulous behavior. (laughter) As data enthusiasts, I'd like to begin with a visually engaging and informative slide that sets the tone for our discussion."
