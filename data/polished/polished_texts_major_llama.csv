Yesterday, I had the opportunity to drive by the new house, and I was thrilled to see that the front window was adorned with a beautiful arrangement of boxes. I'm beyond excited to finally receive the keys at the closing, and we're all set to finalize the process by next Wednesday. I was up until 3 00 am last night, engrossed in a movie marathon with Bethany. It's been a while since we've had a movie night, but it seems like there's been a lot of movie-watching going on around here lately. Here's my rundown of what we watched  last night, we saw thirteen, a film that every mother of a teenager should see. It exceeded my expectations in terms of its quality and impact. Then, we watched Gigli, which lived up to its reputation as being a subpar film. We had to see it for ourselves, as the media's reviews were largely accurate."

The condition becomes increasingly debilitating when I engage in excessive arm movements, particularly when using a mouse on a computer, as I was doing during a marathon session of website updates and online work. As a result, I'm currently struggling to muster the strength to perform even the simplest tasks, including drawing, due to the excruciating pain. The lack of restful sleep has only exacerbated my discomfort, leaving me feeling rather miserable at the moment. However, I'm optimistic that I will eventually recover and regain my usual energy levels. I'm also relieved to report that my mother's surgery went smoothly, and her eyesight has shown some improvement, allowing her to perceive fuzzy shapes and distinguish colors. Although she still faces challenges with her vision, I'm hopeful that she will eventually regain her full visual acuity."

I was also pleasantly surprised by the kindness of strangers, who were sweet to me for no apparent reason other than their genuine desire to be kind. It wasn't as if they were trying to solicit something in return; they simply wanted to be friendly. I had a moment where I had to deal with a drooling child, and I was wearing my designated 'wash-day' outfit. Furthermore, I'm not sure I'll ever feel the need to bathe again anytime soon, so there was no real incentive to rush through the process. As I'm doing two things simultaneously, I'm writing this post and watching a collection of videos at my desk in my room."

While I don't mind lending a helping hand, I often find myself pondering the blurred lines between being a good Samaritan and being taken advantage of. As I've spent the last couple of weeks burning the midnight oil, I had been looking forward to an early night's rest, but it seemed more practical to return the computer to its rightful owner rather than keeping it hostage in my bedroom. *laughs* It seems the weary are destined for no rest.

As a continuation in the 'Is This a Date?' saga, I must admit that after our peculiar lunch, my confidence was shaken, causing me to forget to share an important aspect of the story with you all. Prior to Pat's arrival at lunch, Dustan began discussing Pat's endearing qualities and his efforts to find a compatible partner for him. As I listened intently and nodded along, I began to realize that our conversation was veering more towards finding the perfect match for Dustan than engaging in meaningful dialogue with a stranger over a casual gathering. I excused myself to the restroom, caught a glimpse of my reflection in the mirror, and then posed an introspective question to myself  Am I being pawned off to the other party? Is this the new trajectory of our relationship?"

I believe it would be beneficial if each and every individual in the world would take a moment to reflect before rising from their bed in the morning, making a commitment to maintain this introspective state throughout the day. If they are not prepared to do so, I would suggest that they reconsider their decision and return to the comfort of their bed, surrendering to a restful slumber. I am frustrated by the prevalence of thoughtless actions. While I am not the most erudite individual, I believe it is reasonable to address the careless decisions made by some. Let us focus on specific instances of this phenomenon, and we can reserve further discussion for another time. What do you think?"
8,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,blog,"The two major issues with the scenario outlined in my previous post are  1. While the Bush administration's economic stimulus package has indeed boosted the economy, it has done so in a misguided manner. Robert Rubin, the former Treasury Secretary, recently told NPR's Marketplace that the same stimulus effect could have been achieved without the long-term debt burden by implementing targeted, temporary tax cuts that would primarily benefit low- and middle-income individuals. The mere mention of his name is music to our ears. Quickly, I can think of one Bush administration cabinet official who would have the gravitas to match Rubin's expertise  Paul O'Neill, the former Treasury Secretary. I still have a nagging feeling it will come to me... 2. We cannot afford to give the Republicans control only in wartime, as they have cleverly concocted an endless, global 'War on Terror' that has led to an unwinnable quagmire."

The realization hits you with the profound thought  that you're trapped in a never-ending cycle of boredom, stuck in a never-ending loop of monotony. And it's not just the math class; any subject can be reduced to this soul-sucking, mind-numbing experience. It's the sheer cruelty of being forced to sit through an extended period of time, devoid of any sense of purpose or fulfillment.

Tonight, I was defeated by a small margin and won the Farqu game, possibly due to my opponent's departure after a few short hours and my desire to ensure he felt good on his final night here. Despite the outcome, I must admit that the story cannot compare to the Texas-sized headache I am currently experiencing. I have taken some Aleve, and I must say that it is doing the trick. All I need now is some well-deserved rest and relaxation. Your telephone is the one that helped me wrap the cord around your neck, which I found particularly frustrating at the drive-in."

We embarked on a journey back home from Indiana, and as a result, I'm not sure I'll have the time or energy to write about everything that's been happening in my life lately. However, I must start by expressing my enthusiasm for the incredible experience I had at camp. It was truly amazing and exceeded my expectations. I've undergone a significant transformation, and I'm excited to share the details with you. We arrived at the Twiggs' residence on Friday evening and stayed until our departure on Monday. The majority of our activities consisted of visiting the fair, attending church, a parade, shopping at Walmart, and watching movies.

As a perfectionist, I thrive on excelling in everything I do, but starting anew can be daunting. I'm feeling a sense of trepidation, nervousness, and apprehension, which is only amplified by the uncertainty of the unknown. I've often joked with my friend Cassie that I'll be the only one on the chessboard who insists on moving like a knight, but in reality, I'm not looking forward to being a pawn in this new game.

T.V. Rajeswar, the former Director of the Intelligence Bureau and current Governor of Uttar Pradesh, had previously sounded the alarm in a series of articles published in the Hindustan Times. Shourie poses a pertinent question  does the revelation that Rajeswar, rather than himself or Mr. Advani, was the author of these warnings lend credibility to the predictions, or does it instead lead one to conclude that Rajeswar is a closet communalist, thereby disqualifying him from continuing as Governor of Uttar Pradesh?"

However, it's good to see Tigger taking the reins herself and making an appearance, discussing various topics. Not much to say about yesterday's events, but I did attend a performance of Shakespeare's play on the green, which was lovely, although I had to leave before the curtain closed, which was somewhat disappointing. I hope to see the entirety of a Shakespearean play in the future. But I digress. Tigger is correct about the issues with the shower, it's a significant problem, in terms of finding humor in the shower, one can't help but laugh at the absurdity of it, the look people get when self-torturing themselves can be quite amusing."

As I slowly came to, I was disoriented and disoriented, struggling to discern the time or date. For a few disorienting moments, it was just my mother's gentle voice in the darkness, and I was grappling with the harsh reality. I find myself wondering why I'm feeling so drained...

17,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,blog,"Last night was a particularly disheartening experience. I had to discard the sweater I was painstakingly knitting, having invested about 14 inches of effort. The yarn, which was worth approximately $10, had unfortunately become too knotted and unruly by the time I reached the armholes, causing the mohair to become entangled as I continued knitting. The yarn broke frequently, and I found it challenging to frogging (ripping out rows) effectively. I was on the verge of losing my temper, which is unusual for me, as I usually manage to keep my frustration in check. In the end, I simply became exasperated and opted to abandon the project, opting instead to indulge in a more relaxing activity, such as listening to the second season of Sex and the City, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Although I didn't derive the satisfaction I had hoped for from completing the sweater, I did gain a valuable lesson from the experience."

Casey's seminal work, ""Getting Back into Place  Toward a Renewed Study of the Place-World."" The first chapter, ""Implacement,"" and the subsequent ""Displacement,"" offer a thought-provoking exploration of the concept of time as the dominant force shaping our contemporary world and culture. Casey skillfully argues that our society's emphasis on time as the situating force has led to a disconnection from the notion of place as the central axis of our cultural identity. He posits that by reconceptualizing place as the foundation of culture, we can cultivate a more grounded and community-driven existence. This reading has been the most compelling thus far in our course, and I must admit that it has left a lasting impression on me."

However, this curiosity may lead to a peculiar phenomenon, where one's life becomes slightly unconventional. While giggling is an excellent way to cope with the unexpected, one cannot help but wonder what would have transpired if we had not consumed those pops earlier. As we found ourselves in front of a closed bar, we stumbled upon an office-supplies catalogue that had been delivered to our doorstep. To our surprise, this ordinary catalogue held the key to a lifetime of extraordinary deals. Among the numerous offers, we discovered a few remarkable ones  purchase 36 permanent marker pens and receive a stunt kite as a bonus, or buy 30 lever arch files and get a barbecue as a delightful surprise."

Meanwhile, I must admit that I found myself tuning in to the 39-hour Senate session on judicial nominations last week, despite my initial reluctance. The spectacle was a colossal waste of time, orchestrated by Republicans who were frustrated that Democrats wouldn't simply rubber-stamp four of President Bush's nominees, a move they believed would yield political capital. However, this ignores the fact that Democrats have already confirmed 168 of Bush's judicial appointments. The Republicans' true motivation appears to be a misguided notion that they have a mandate for this type of political posturing, which is far from the case."

Following a prolonged hiatus, I dedicated a significant amount of time to indulging in a literary marathon, devoting myself to the world of reading. I devoured three captivating novels - Bruce Sterling's 'Heavy Weather', Larry Niven's 'World of Ptavvs', and Octavia Butler's 'Parable of the Sower'. 'Heavy Weather' transported me to a dystopian near-future United States ravaged by the devastating effects of global warming and societal chaos. Although the novel was expertly crafted, with a well-paced narrative and vividly rendered characters, I must admit that I didn't find myself deeply invested in the story or its protagonists. The novel was enjoyable, but it lacked a profound emotional resonance, leaving me with a sense of mild satisfaction rather than a lasting impression."

The aftermath of this experience has been a sobering realization, as I've come to understand that it's not just an individual issue, but rather a widespread problem that affects many students. Fortunately, a meeting with the course coordinator helped me to unburden myself, and in doing so, I was able to spare another student from experiencing the same pedagogically deficient practicum that I did. Yesterday, I ran into a fellow classmate who was determined to warn a peer about the difficulties they would face in the upcoming practicum. I calmed her down and suggested that we should report our concerns to the administrator first, rather than risking further distress for another student."

We have a ping pong table in the lobby of our building, which has become a popular spot for a quick game during breaks. Last night, I participated in an 8-ball tournament at our recreation tent, which is equipped with a popcorn machine, multiple TVs, a jukebox, DVD rentals, a pool table, dartboard, and of course, the ever-present ping pong table.

As I wrestled to decipher the complexities of algebra, the doorbell rang, interrupting my struggle. I set my book aside and went to answer the door, only to find it was an empty gesture. I returned to my studies, just as I was on the cusp of grasping a glimmer of understanding, the doorbell rang once more. This time, my epiphany vanished as suddenly as it had appeared. I opened the door, only to find it was another prank, leaving me, a struggling math student, feeling bewildered and bemused."

Had I known I was relocating prior to the end of my school year, I would have discarded a substantial amount of books and supplies that I no longer require. Unfortunately, the task fell to me, and I spent the entire week moving, unpacking, and purging my belongings.

The article I am working on and its implications are not entirely in line with my personal values and principles. Perhaps it's because I lack the conviction required to fully immerse myself in the subject matter. The underlying passion and conviction I need to question it are not yet fully developed. I have grown up in a culture where questioning authority is not the norm. In fact, in my country, asking questions can have severe consequences, including imprisonment and other forms of persecution. As a result, I am not accustomed to exercising my right to free speech, nor am I comfortable expressing my dissenting opinions out loud. I am not an individual who easily gets along with others."

The anticipation was palpable, and we were relieved to finally arrive at our destination. The icy water was invigorating, and the coldness seeped into our bones, leaving us numb. We lingered for less than an hour, taking in the breathtaking views of the falls, before continuing our journey to the nearby waterfalls. The additional 30-minute trek was well worth the effort, as the scenery was nothing short of breathtaking.

As a result, Connor had a fantastic time searching for eggs throughout the park. The following morning, when he woke up, he was ecstatic to discover that the Easter bunny had indeed arrived. There's nothing more heartwarming than witnessing the excitement on a child's face. Following the egg hunt, we attended church, acknowledging that while the Easter bunny may be a fun and whimsical tradition, we prioritize instilling the true meaning of the holiday in our children.

As a non-American blogger, I have been hesitant to engage in discussions on this topic, particularly those surrounding the burning of flags, but since I initiated this conversation, I feel compelled to share my thoughts. In my opinion, the notion of enshrining a law against flag-burning is utterly misguided. The moment you establish a symbol, any symbol, as having automatic reverence and protection, you take a small but significant step towards totalitarianism. Symbols are ephemeral and their meaning is determined by how they are perceived or created to represent. It is crucial to recognize that symbols do not inherently possess inherent meaning; it is what they are perceived as meaning or made to represent that holds significance."

I am writing to follow up on our discussion yesterday afternoon regarding the Nsp Powerpac agreement. Reyna and I reviewed the agreement and came back with a few key points in mind. We were looking for language in the agreement that may require us to truly uphold for the customer, regardless of whether or not we were allocating storage on a specific gas day. Upon reviewing the agreement, we noticed that we did not put our finger on any language in the current agreement (dated April 1, 2001) that requires us to uphold for them.

As you are aware, the emergency tariff filing by the California ISO last Friday has had a negative impact on the PX Day Ahead Auction market. The mix of soft and hard caps has resulted in a complete disconnection and unacceptable risk to all of our participants. This will probably not provide the ISO with its sought-after reduction in real-time energy sales and procurement. The overall effect will be that supply will still defer to the higher realized price opportunity the ISO offers.

The PX is petitioning Terry Winter of the ISO to immediately allow for adjustment bids on any submitted schedule at any price relevant."

96,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"The game is exceptional, exceeding my expectations and I'm confident it will surpass yours too. The game's fluid movement and lack of bugs/crashes make it an absolute delight to play. The sheer amount of content, including daily practices, events, and games, ensures that there's always something new to look forward to. As someone who's played through my career, I can confidently say that this game is a 10/10 experience. The Facescan feature worked well for me, allowing me to scan for free and earn daily VCs. Note that using the My NBA 2K17 app will grant you the ability to Facescan for free and earn daily VCs. Overall, I highly recommend this game, and I'm confident you'll find it to be an excellent addition to your gaming library."
97,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"Warning to all magic enthusiasts  The Wizards' latest digital game is a social phenomenon that has lost its magical core. This game is designed to be enjoyed with friends, whether they be friends or frenemies, as you engage in hilarious banter, share laughs, and drop game-winning bombs. It seems that the Wizards on the coast have forgotten this crucial aspect. If you opt to play with friends, you can earn gold, and gold is crucial. Gold is so vital that it has been implemented with a daily cap, considering gold unlocks everything in the game. However, be prepared for a long and tedious 1v1 grind against the computer or random opponents, whom you cannot even communicate with. If you choose to play for free, it will take you roughly four hours a day for upwards of a month, solo, to unlock the cards."
98,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"The third installment in the trilogy, I will address the negative aspects first. I strongly dislike pre-qualifications, as it is a step backward in storytelling, rather than forward progress. Although it does provide more story depth, the combat mechanics feel sloppy and lack the finesse of Arkham City's combat, which was a major aspect of its success. As of the time of writing this review (October 26, 2013), a game-breaking bug exists that prevents a side mission from being completed (the main story remains unaffected). Furthermore, some gadgets are inconveniently located at a ridiculous hotkey, requiring an arduous journey across the keyboard to access them. Although this may seem trivial, it could potentially disrupt the flow of combat and even break a combo in the heat of the moment."
99,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"The 2013 installment of the Shadow Warrior series, Shadow Warrior 2, boasts a plethora of impressive boss battles, with weapons that are both visually appealing and functional. While they may not quite measure up to the standards set by the highly-regarded Dark Souls series, they are still a solid offering. The enemy AI is well-balanced, and once you become accustomed to the upgrade system, it becomes relatively unobtrusive. The limited ammo and elemental abilities force you to diversify your weapon choices, which is a refreshing change from the often-repetitive gameplay found in other games of this genre. The unique and varied arsenal of weapons ensures that many remain viable throughout most of the game. The soundtrack is also noteworthy, with the main theme and additional tracks by Stan Bush being particular highlights."
101,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"I was thoroughly impressed with the Assassin's Creed series, which excelled in its execution on multiple fronts, including ship battles, sailing, hunting, and parkour, among others. As I delved deeper into the story, I found myself becoming increasingly attached to the protagonist, whose character development was well-crafted. The narrative begins with a rocky start, but it gradually improves as the game progresses, much like every action-adventure game I've played. Edward, as a character, was particularly intriguing, and so were the supporting characters. I felt that each collectible item had a tangible purpose in the game, which is something I never experienced in previous games. Perhaps this is because I sensed that they played a more significant role in the story, even if they weren't essential to the main plot. They were enjoyable to collect and were rewarded in a well-balanced manner."
102,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"While I cannot wholeheartedly endorse this game, it was not entirely unremarkable. The gunplay was satisfactory, as long as you can afford to purchase gun parts, which was my primary gripe with this game  it's a pay-to-win model. If I could overlook that, the game would be enjoyable, as the hardsuit was fun to use and the hrv concept was an excellent idea. I would choose this game over any Call of Duty title, but its pay-to-win microtransaction format was off-putting for me. If you're comfortable with this model, then by all means, have fun. However, if you're like me and dislike pay-to-win games, I would advise against it; it's not my cup of tea."
103,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"While I've experienced some minor frustrations, I've thoroughly enjoyed this game. The save system, unfortunately, is imperfect, as the risk of sudden death can be disheartening. On my first playthrough, I suffered a setback when my main character perished around the 10-hour mark, which is roughly 10% through the game. I've since acquired a third-party mod with a save feature to prevent such catastrophic failures from occurring. Additionally, the aiming reticle is slightly undersized, and the zoom functionality could be more robust. Notwithstanding these minor drawbacks, I've found the game to be an absolute blast. As someone who doesn't typically enjoy zombie-themed games, I've been pleasantly surprised by the engaging combination of strategic gameplay, mission objectives, and first-person shooter/beat-em-up mechanics. I've found myself playing it as frequently as possible, often finding myself thinking, 'Just one more mission, just one more supply run - or I'll be running away and want to get to a safe location before shutting the game down.'"
104,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"This game is an absolute masterpiece of strategy! Having played every other war game (European Escalation and Albion), I must say that this one stands out. The sheer number of units is impressive. While I'm not entirely sure how many units there are, it's safe to say there are a substantial amount. The graphics are stunning, the sound design is excellent, and the overall gameplay is nothing short of epic. The in-game chat box at the main menu is also an added bonus, and I'm not being facetious when I say it's quite entertaining. However, if you're new to the strategy genre or underestimate the complexity of this game, it may take some time to get accustomed to it. Don't be discouraged if you lose units – it's all part of the learning process. Just make sure to plan ahead, always maintain a strong defense, and adapt to the situation at hand."
105,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"I was initially skeptical about this game before I played it, unsure if I wanted to purchase it. The concept of portal guns and portals seemed unusual to me, even though I appreciate science fiction. I was pleasantly surprised, as I discovered that the humor and voice acting in this game are truly phenomenal. The story's not cheesy (although it can be cheesy at times). The distinct personalities of the various characters are well-developed and relatable, with each one having their own unique sense of humor. The level design is also impressive, with a unique blend of complexity and accessibility. I must admit that I never played the first Portal game, but after experiencing the sequel, I'm considering taking the time to play it. In fact, I wouldn't have played it if I hadn't enjoyed the first game so much."
107,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"Embark on a nostalgic journey with this retro-style Transformers game, reminiscent of the beloved 5-minute cartoon series that captivated the hearts of 30-somethings in the UK. The iconic voice actors behind Optimus, Megatron, Bumblebee, and other beloved characters return, instantly recognizable and nostalgic. The distinctive sound design, reminiscent of the classic cartoon, is a masterclass in evoking a bygone era. Visually, the cell-shaded graphics are a triumph, transporting players to a bygone generation. But beyond its aesthetic appeal, the game's combat mechanics are a true standout. The seamless integration of mid-fight transformations, woven into fluid combos, elevates the gameplay experience, setting it apart from other Transformers titles. Notably, the emphasis on melee combat is a refreshing change of pace, while certain enemies, such as the Seekers, require a strategic shift to ranged attacks, adding depth to the overall experience."
108,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"I recently downloaded and played the game for a short while, only to find it lacked any remarkable features. The login process was more tedious than the actual gameplay. I encountered a peculiar issue where the game prompted me to accept an update to the terms of service, only to have it repeatedly appear upon clicking 'accept'. The only solution was to restart the client, which was not a major inconvenience. I was perplexed by the requirement to link my Steam and Gface accounts, as I was told it was necessary for downloadable content. However, it's concerning that this information is not reversible, allowing an unknown company to access my Steam data. Moreover, the game itself was underwhelming, with gameplay that was easily recognizable as a clone of a popular title, except for the poor gunplay, which was somehow made worse. It's difficult to comprehend how such a fundamental aspect of the game could be compromised."
109,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"Experience the thrill of 4K resolution at 60 frames per second, courtesy of the GTX 970 graphics card, and indulge in dual audio options that cater to your unique preferences. The inclusion of Neptune Gear adds an extra layer of excitement to this exceptional port. As a newcomer to the series, this game serves as an excellent entry point, offering a rich narrative and engaging gameplay. While there is some exposition that can be skipped, the game's pacing is well-balanced, and the rebindable controls for keyboard and mouse ensure a seamless gaming experience. The price is reasonable, and the inclusion of over half the DLC at no additional cost provides ample content to keep you entertained. I highly recommend this game to fans of JRPGs, anime, and visual novels, provided you're willing to tolerate occasional breaks in the action. For those seeking a commentary-free experience, I've curated a playlist available here  https //www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plslfvijaupszez9af395mvnk63xnhsj1. Cheers!"
110,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"I'm thrilled to report that I experienced no performance issues, even at the initial release, and after the numerous patches, the game plays remarkably well. In my opinion, this game is an absolute delight, offering an incredibly engaging and enjoyable experience. Although, I do acknowledge that the format may be somewhat unconventional (specifically, the free-roam city area repopulates with new enemies every time you progress through the story), I found the 'dual play' segments, where I could play Batman alongside another player, to be a particularly standout feature. The ability to utilize the controller for most segments of the game, while using the mouse and keyboard for the tank combat segments, was a greatly appreciated touch. Moreover, driving the Batmobile around the free-roam city, including when chasing after the ApC commanders, is an exhilarating experience that becomes increasingly enjoyable once you master the art of using the brakes to skid around corners, and when you've mastered that, navigating the city becomes an absolute blast."
112,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"As a non-native English speaker, I'd like to provide an honest review of this exceptional game, despite any minor linguistic imperfections. I'll break down my assessment into four distinct categories  graphics, controls, sound, and replayability.

Graphics  The game's comic-like style is visually stunning, boasting sleek and detailed visuals with vibrant color schemes. The graphics can be set to 'high' without putting a strain on your system, even on mid-range hardware. I've played the game on an Intel i5 processor with an NVIDIA GeForce 710M graphics card, 8GB of RAM, and Windows 8.1, and it runs smoothly like clockwork.

Controls  The game can be played with a keyboard and mouse, but it's also compatible with an Xbox controller, offering a more immersive gaming experience."
114,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"I've been playing for two hours, and I'm on the verge of dying from laughter. The gameplay is solid, the art design is breathtakingly beautiful, the music is surprisingly high-quality and perfectly fitting, the story/world has me thoroughly enthralled, and the puzzles are delightfully engaging. However, the most remarkable aspect of this game is its comedy. If you've played any role-playing game since the dawn of video game RPGs, you'll be in stitches at the numerous jokes, parodies, and references; if you're new to the world of RPGs, you'll still find the game's humor endearing. If you've played Final Fantasy 7 or X, you absolutely must play this game, without giving away too many spoilers... I had to pause my gameplay after two hours to give my cheeks a break from grinning from ear to ear due to excessive smiling. What a sheer delight it has been so far."
115,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"I'm genuinely sorry, but I'm deeply disappointed that I couldn't find myself enjoying this game, despite my enthusiasm for free-to-play games and indie developers. The game's description initially resonated with me, but unfortunately, the execution fell short of my expectations. As a fan of puzzle and exploration games, I was excited to dive in, but unfortunately, I found the gameplay to be utterly unintuitive, and even after consulting online resources, I still struggled to find the experience enjoyable. The lack of a pause button is a glaring omission, particularly given that many sequences in the game are timed. This oversight seems inexcusable, especially considering the game's overall brevity. Moreover, I feel that the game is overly reliant on cutscenes, leaving me feeling like I'm simply twiddling my thumbs, waiting for something to happen."
116,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"This game was an utterly captivating experience from start to finish. The story was beautifully crafted, and I was completely absorbed in it. The narrative was not just a story, but an immersive experience that made me feel like I was the protagonist, trying to unravel the mystery that my character was unfolding. The gameplay was engaging, and I learned a lot about myself through this game, particularly about my fear of heights, which I never had a problem with until the ice caverns. My stomach was churning the whole time, but I persevered for Uncle Fred! If you were to create a DLC or a sequel, I would be the first to buy it and wholeheartedly recommend it to everyone I know. A huge thank you to everyone involved in making this game, you created an absolutely breathtaking experience."
117,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"Sid Meier's Civilization  Beyond Earth is a turn-based game that challenges you to build your civilization to achieve a specific goal or 'victory' on a new planet. Unlike previous games in the Civilization series, this installment takes a bold approach by setting the game in the future, allowing players to colonize a new planet and navigate its unique challenges. One of the most innovative features of this game is the introduction of the affinity system and orbital layer, which adds a new layer of depth to the gameplay experience. However, some players may find the game overwhelming at times, particularly with the sheer amount of new mechanics introduced. To further enhance the game, it would be beneficial to incorporate more diverse and visually stunning artwork, such as the environment, to create a more immersive experience when interacting with other leaders. This could include the ability to explore and experience the environment in a more engaging and visually appealing way."
119,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"It's a shame I can't thoroughly recommend or enjoy this game, as from the short time I've played it, I know I'd be addicted if it didn't have the following two game-breakers. Unfortunately, the game is marred by two major issues  the lack of Aussie servers and poor performance. The lack of servers is particularly egregious, as one red bar puts you at a severe disadvantage, causing unbearable lag. I've played through the offline training mode, and it was equally plagued by stuttering and lag (it's astonishing that this could happen). Combine this with the poor ping, and it utterly ruins the game. Furthermore, the game's artifacts, such as the menus, backgrounds, and in-game elements, are laughable. I've never experienced this level of poor performance with this graphics card and thought it might be an issue with my overclocked processor. However, I set my GPU back to stock settings, and, sure enough, it didn't make a difference."
120,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"I recently completed the game last night, and while it may not be a deeply complex or captivating story, the storytelling is what truly elevates it. The atmosphere is richly detailed, and the numerous collectibles do an excellent job of fleshing it out. I gained a significant understanding of the Batman universe, which was a slight letdown, given the scarcity of boss battles. However, there is a bright future ahead, with upcoming games set to rectify this imbalance. The combat is well-balanced, with a suitable level of challenge, although it tilts slightly towards the easier side. Levelling up Batman wasn't particularly fulfilling, as it's the gadgets and upgrades you acquire during the campaign that add fresh gameplay mechanics. Unlocking previously inaccessible areas provides a sense of progression and accomplishment."
121,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"To venture to the moon is no mere pastime... Nay, it is a profound and unforgettable experience, and it was one of the most remarkable moments of my life. I must confess, I was utterly enthralled by Telltale's The Walking Dead, and it's no exaggeration to say that it was a highlight of my gaming journey. The narrative is a masterclass in storytelling, with a soundtrack that is nothing short of enchanting and pitch-perfect. Yes, the controls may be a tad finicky, and the gameplay may not be the strongest aspect, but the story is so captivating that I didn't even notice. Moreover, the humor is expertly woven throughout, adding a delightful layer of depth to the narrative without ever intruding upon its distinguished tone... And the references to the world of medicine are nothing short of brilliant."
123,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"I had initially acquired this game during its early development, when the primary form of currency was spacebux, and there was no 'tech tree' in place. At that time, the game was still in its infancy, with all weapons being equally overpowered, which meant that there were no balance issues; any player could easily take down another at any given moment. Additionally, the game initially provided unlimited gun slots and five loadouts, which might have been a generous offering, considering the sheer scale of the game's 'bajillions of guns'. It was only later, when I had amassed a collection of around three pages' worth of weapons, that I began to feel the need for more variety, as I was eager to explore new ideas and strategies. This was because, personally, I found the sheer scope of the game's arsenal to be a major part of the fun."
124,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"This game was a delightful discovery. The reviews of certain products often feature glowing praise, but in this instance, the reviews accurately capture the enjoyable essence of this charming game. It's an intriguing blend of a classic 2D platformer and a MOBA, executed with panache. I found myself drawn to characters that I wouldn't typically appreciate in other MOBA games. Initially, I was skeptical about the potential for a melee tank, but I was pleasantly surprised by the outcome and ended up exploring more characters as they became available through continued gameplay. The art style and user interface are delightfully charming. As a result, I now use one of the characters as my avatar and a wallpaper from creating a card set for the game, showcasing my fondness for this delightful experience."
125,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"I've recently embarked on a new gaming adventure, and I must confess that I'm utterly enthralled by this game. Hours can easily slip away as I become completely immersed in the experience, a phenomenon that hasn't occurred with a game in a while. The immersive atmosphere is largely due to the masterful combination of the soundtrack, sound effects, and controls, which all work in harmony to transport me to a world of endless excitement. I eagerly anticipate each combat encounter, and the developers have skillfully optimized the combat mechanics to ensure an exhilarating experience. Initially, I harbored some reservations about the naval combat system, but it's surprisingly enjoyable to unleash havoc on multiple fleets simultaneously. The only way to succumb to defeat is to neglect the importance of strategic retreats and regrouping, and instead, I've found myself getting outflanked and defeated. Kudos to the developers for crafting an experience that has truly left an indelible mark on my gaming journey."
126,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"The reboot of the Devil May Cry franchise has brought about a seismic shift in the series, particularly for its protagonist, Dante. The change may be jarring for fans of the original series, who have grown attached to the character. However, this new game by Ninja Theory proves that the alteration is for the better; and DMC serves as the ideal entry point for newcomers to jump into the series. The game masterfully crafts a compelling narrative arc for the new Dante, transforming him from an arrogant, cynical individual to a selfless hero. The story follows Dante as he is inducted into the corrupt world he willfully chose to ignore, presenting a gripping tale of his transformation from cynicism to selflessness."
127,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"This enchanting game is a masterpiece of storytelling, boasting an captivating narrative that effortlessly balances lighthearted humor with poignant seriousness. The game's attention to detail is remarkable, weaving together a tapestry of happiness, clever wordplay, and engaging characters with rich backstories and hidden secrets. The character designs are masterfully crafted, each with their own distinct personalities and motivations. One of the most refreshing aspects of this RPG is the innovative concept of not having to resort to violence, which sets it apart from other games in the genre. Drawing inspiration from the esteemed Earthbound, one of the most iconic RPGs of all time, it's clear that this game is destined for greatness. The soundtrack is a sonic masterpiece, boasting a score that is sure to leave a lasting impression."
128,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"I am recommending this solely because it's free, and it offers a potentially more enjoyable experience for others. As for my experience, the game failed to elicit a reaction from me. Half the story relies on shocking elements, but I wasn't shocked or emotionally moved in any way, which may be a result of desensitization or the simplicity of the narrative. The other half of the game attempts to paint a vivid picture of a person's mental decline, exploring themes such as obsession, hallucinations, depression, and other mental health struggles. In theory, the concept is intriguing, but the game took me 10 minutes to complete, which is a testament to the need for patience and attention to detail in order to fully absorb the information presented."
129,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"Does it even need to be said why Portal is an extraordinary achievement? Portal is a puzzle game that presents a concept, then promptly disappears, leaving you with an intellectual challenge that is both entertaining and mentally stimulating. Although this game may not be narrative-driven, it has given rise to one of the most beloved games of 2011, and I still find myself returning to it when I'm feeling under-stimulated, as I'm drawn to explore the origins of a phenomenon and the enduring legend surrounding it. Gameplay  Portal's gameplay is refreshingly straightforward, at its core. You utilize portals to your advantage, in combination with buttons that activate specific puzzle elements. There are two buttons in the game - one that you press, and one that requires a cube to be applied."
130,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"If I can overlook the minor bugs, which I personally experienced only two  one minor and the other quite frustrating, I can confidently recommend this game for space exploration enthusiasts. The recent edit has significantly improved my frame rate, increasing it from 60-90 to 80-120 frames per second. With its impressive specifications, including an i5-6600k processor, Radeon RX480 graphics card, 16GB DDR4 RAM, and a budget-friendly price tag of around 650€, this gaming rig is an excellent option for those seeking a high-performance gaming experience. Although some users may argue that this setup is overkill, I can attest that I've experienced a consistent 60+ frames per second on high settings with vsync enabled, which is significantly higher than the 20 frames per second reported by many users. Overall, I highly recommend this game for those seeking an immersive space exploration experience."
131,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"Remember the age of mythology? Indeed, it has been a long time since there has been an RTS game of such exceptional quality. Divinity  Dragon Commander comes close to my personal favorite RTS game. Combine this with a grand strategy mode that carries a high level of risk, and it hits the mark. I am not (read  I will not be) biased in my assessment, as this game allows you to transform into a dragon, providing support to your troops by offering guidance, leading units in attack and production, and even commanding unit deployment and spawning simultaneously. Honestly, I genuinely appreciate the complex RTS games currently available. I think of games like Civilization V and others. However, these games attempt to pack complex mechanics, charts, and resources into a single, intricate game mode."
132,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"The artistry of Undertale comes together to create a masterpiece that transcends the sum of its individual components. The retro aesthetic of the graphics and the melodic quality of the music harmonize to create truly breathtaking and emotionally resonant moments. The script masterfully navigates a range of emotions, effortlessly transitioning from comedic to dramatic to heart-wrenching to hopeful, often seamlessly blending multiple emotions into a single, impactful experience. Without delving into the world, characters, story, or gameplay mechanics, I could write an exhaustive analysis of its intricacies. Instead, I'll simply say this  if you're a fan of role-playing games, do yourself a favor and play this game. If you're a gamer at heart, play this game. If you have seven free hours between now and your eventual demise, seize the opportunity to experience this remarkable adventure."
134,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"I've had the privilege of playing this game for only a few months, and in that relatively short period, two DLCs have already been released, accompanied by patches that have transformed an already impressive game into an outstanding one. The developers' commitment to the community is evident in the numerous discussion forums and developer diaries, where their dedication to the game's growth is palpable. While the game's mechanics may present a steep learning curve, the sheer breadth of strategic options available to me allows me to experiment with various approaches and capitalize on specific situations. In my opinion, the game is almost infinitely replayable, and I find myself becoming increasingly engrossed in each session, regardless of the play-through outcome."
135,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"Warframe is an entertaining game for the initial hours of play. However, after those few enjoyable hours, you'll begin to realize that the game's content is largely repetitive, with limited variety in its combat, enemies, and gameplay. The one notable aspect is that the developers are actively working on updates, which typically include significant changes to the game's systems, new Warframes, and other features. While it's a great game for casual play, I'm skeptical it will maintain your interest beyond a few months unless you're deeply invested in grinding. Fortunately, the game's free nature makes it worth trying out. If you're seeking a quick distraction, give it a shot."
136,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"This game is a disappointing experience, to say the least. I was misled into thinking it was a PC version of 'Katamari Damacy', a game I had fond memories of playing on the PlayStation 2. Unfortunately, it's a far cry from the original. The gameplay is marred by clunky controls and unoriginal level design, which makes for a surreal and unsettling experience. It's not just the gameplay that's the problem, but the game's atmosphere and themes, which left me feeling uneasy and questioning the meaning of existence. Every living creature in this game, from small pets to human beings, seems to be a mere prop, leading me to wonder if the game's creators had a fascination with taxidermy."
137,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"Here's my review of the game  ""I was initially intrigued when I first learned about this game, as someone who is deeply interested in politics. The concept of a simulator for the road to becoming president seemed fascinating. Unfortunately, my excitement was short-lived, as the game's initial presentation was quite underwhelming. The game starts by asking you to choose a side  Republican, Democrat, or third-party options are not available. Despite my initial disappointment, I decided to continue playing to see what I could accomplish. I do give the game credit for its character customization, which, although limited, is still enjoyable to play around with. The ability to wear a head or not in a campaign is a unique feature, to say the least."
139,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"My gaming experience with this game was marked by a significant amount of time spent, with a total of 8.6 hours dedicated to reaching its conclusion. Throughout my journey, I discovered a total of 10 collectibles out of a possible 25, and unfortunately, I did not achieve any of the 15 available achievements. The aspects that I enjoyed the most were the visuals, which remained impressive until the very end, particularly the ice caves. While the story itself was not particularly remarkable, the ending, however, left a lasting impression, making the time I invested in playing this game feel worthwhile. On the other hand, the visuals in the final level were underwhelming, and the gameplay became increasingly frustrating as it became necessary to repeat the same tasks numerous times before achieving success. Moreover, the achievements were extremely challenging, with only 1.7% of players, including myself, managing to achieve more than 2 of the 15 available."
140,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"Pros  +Graphics. Cons 

- The game is marred by numerous bugs, particularly in the environment, which can cause frustration and even lead to becoming stuck or having your shots hit an invisible wall, despite having a clear line of sight on the enemy.
- The game's hand-holding and babysitting approach can be overly reliant on the AI, making it feel more like a chore to play.
- Enemies seem to have a God-like accuracy, making it disconcerting when you're spotted, like the first Ghost Warrior.
- The game's checkpoints and saves are also subpar, adding to the overall frustration.
- The story is underwhelming and unengaging, making it difficult to care about it. Unless it's at a significant discount (90% off), I wouldn't recommend it. Even then, playing this game feels like an extremely tedious task, only done to check it off my library and move on to the next game. Considering the time I wasted on the first Ghost Warrior (which was equally underwhelming), I'm likely to put off playing this one until the very end."
143,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"It's not difficult for me to understand why others enjoy this game, but it wasn't for me. I have a vivid imagination and I'm more interested in playing immersive, room-sized games with controllers. While the game's scale is initially awe-inspiring, I also felt that same scale hindered my enjoyment. The learning curve and the time required to do anything interesting at the beginning were too steep for me. Perhaps if I were more patient and had more time for gaming, this would be more engaging. However, I don't have the luxury of time, and there are many other VR games I'd rather spend my time on."
144,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"Hands down, my favorite first-person shooter of all time. The run-and-gun playstyle, which is often associated with this genre, need not apply. The recoil and ballistics are remarkably realistic. A single hit to the chest, neck, or head from a rifle-caliber weapon almost always results in death, unless it merely grazes you. Rounds drop over distance and short, controlled bursts are essential if you wish to remain on target. It's crucial to be mindful of your ammunition supply, as there is no magical ammunition pool. If you reload halfway through your magazine, you'll be left with a pouch full of half-full mags. It's crucial to pace yourself, as sprinting for an extended period will inevitably lead to a decline in your aim. To maintain accuracy, it's essential to rest your weapon on your elbows while prone or on a window sill, allowing your aim to stabilize. Your accuracy will suffer if you stand upright, as the adrenaline rush will impede your ability to focus and control your breathing."

""I must preface by stating that I did not purchase EU when it initially launched, and I acquired it on sale, which included EU and XCOM2. This allowed me to avoid the issues that some players have reported experiencing with the game. I thoroughly enjoyed EU, despite it being unforgiving in the early stages, as it provided a sense of accomplishment when I executed tasks correctly. In contrast, XCOM2 has been a different story. I've found it to be a well-optimized game that runs smoothly on my mid-range hardware, a GTX560 with 2GB of VRAM. Initially, I set the graphics settings to high, but it did experience some lag, although it was not to the point of being unplayable. However, when I adjusted the settings to medium, the game ran without any issues. It's possible that I've been fortunate when it comes to encountering problems with games, or perhaps it's just a matter of perspective, but it seems that many of the negative reviews are coming from players who appear to be overly critical and entitled."
146,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,game_review,"The game offers a rich RPG experience with a wide variety of ship types and physics-based movement for both ships and projectiles/missiles. The game features easy-to-learn resource management, allowing players to focus on strategy and gameplay. However, it's not without its drawbacks, including sub-par AI teammates, a limited selection of equipment types, and a linear leveling system with little branching. Despite these limitations, the game still offers a fun and engaging experience. The fast-paced action and constant sense of progression keep players invested, with the promise of new ships and skills to unlock and level up. To truly unlock the full potential of this game, mods are essential. The space combat is undoubtedly the main attraction, but the intense battles for resources are also a major draw. Overall, this game is a great starting point for fans of the genre, and with the right mods, it can become an even more enjoyable experience."

To address this issue, we propose a novel approach that pits spammers against spam detectors in a game-like environment, where their respective goals are not solely focused on detection accuracy. By achieving a Nash equilibrium in this game, we can develop stable detectors that are resilient to any mixed detection strategies, thereby maintaining the integrity of online reviews and promoting a trustworthy online marketplace."

To ensure exceptionally high fidelity, we employ the Lewis-Riesenfeld (L-R) method to derive a family of solutions leading to an exact transfer, where the solutions follow a single dynamic mode of the L-R invariant. Within this family, we identify a tracking solution with a single parameter to simultaneously control the fidelity of the transfer, the population of the excited state, and robustness. We define a measure of the robustness of an ultra-high-fidelity transfer as the minimum percentile deviation on the pulse areas at which the infidelity rises above 10^-4. The robustness of our shaped pulses is found superior to that of Gaussian and adiabatically-optimized pulses for moderate pulse areas, and is characterized by its ability to maintain exceptional fidelity and precision in a wide range of transfer conditions."

We demonstrate that all local minima share a common structural property, which provides partial identification of the component centers of the true mixture. Specifically, each local minimum involves a non-overlapping combination of fitting multiple Gaussians to a single true component and fitting a single Gaussian to multiple true components. Our findings are applicable to the scenario where the true mixture components satisfy a certain separation condition and remain valid even when the number of components is over- or under-specified. In the case of Gaussian mixtures with three components, we achieve sharper results in terms of the scaling between the components, as well as the separation between the components."

In our simulations, we examine the long-term behavior of six super-Earths experiencing strong scattering forces over a period of 50,000 years.

However, as the Hilbert space dimension increases exponentially with system size, it is extremely challenging to construct an efficient entanglement witness for general multipartite entangled states. For $n$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-like states, the most robust witness scheme requires $n+1$ local measurement settings and can tolerate up to $1/2$ white noise. In contrast, the most efficient witness for GHZ-like states necessitates only two local measurement settings and can tolerate up to $1/3$ white noise, making it a more practical and scalable solution for entanglement detection."

These geometries can break the axial and equatorial symmetry of the Kerr metric, exhibiting a much richer multipolar structure that offers a gateway to constrain fuzzball models phenomenologically. Our findings reveal numerical evidence indicating that all multipole moments are typically significantly larger (in absolute value) than those of a Kerr black hole with the same mass and spin. Current measurements of the quadrupole moment of black-hole candidates impose only modest constraints on fuzzballs, whereas future gravitational-wave detections of extreme mass-ratio inspirals with the space-based mission LISA will significantly enhance these bounds by several orders of magnitude."

The equivariant stable homotopy groups of every global spectrum form a global Mackey functor, so the splittings imply that certain long exact homotopy group sequences split into short exact sequences.

The nonparametric formulation of this approach, known as modal clustering, establishes a correspondence between the groups and the domains of attraction of the density modes. Operationally, a nonparametric density estimate is required, and the proper selection of the amount of smoothing, which governs the shape of the density and potentially the modal structure, is crucial to identify the final partition.

In this scenario, carefully measuring the azimuthal decay angles ""resurrects"" the interference, recouping sensitivity to the ""non-interfering"" operators. We delve into these signatures in detail, and find that the uncertainties associated with higher-dimensional operators are uniquely well-suppressed by the construction of an asymmetry variable, which is solely generated by these non-interfering operators, relegating the effects of higher-dimensional, interfering operators to the same status as statistical errors in this observable.

Like others before, we categorize the scientific contributions of data science into three distinct classes of tasks  description, prediction, and counterfactual prediction (which encompasses causal inference).

The standard lore suggests that these particles are introduced to ensure that extremal black holes are either unstable or marginally stable, but the implications of this assumption are unclear if it does not occur. This note reveals that, for a generic Einsteinian quantum theory of gravity in Anti-de Sitter space, the stability of extremal black branes is in tension with rigorously proven quantum information theorems about entanglement entropy. To avoid this contradiction, a non-perturbative version of the WGC is required, which reduces to the usual statement at weak coupling. The argument is general and does not rely on either supersymmetry or a particular UV completion, assuming only the validity of Einstein's gravity, effective field theory, and holography."

Here, we provide conclusive evidence of superfluidity in an ultracold Fermi gas by inducing a periodic potential and observing the absence of dissipation below a critical velocity, v_c. Our measurement of v_c as a function of interaction strength reveals a maximum in the crossover regime between bosonic and fermionic superfluidity.

However, a critical consideration is the long-term stability of the implantation-induced conductivity, particularly when the implanted metal species is prone to oxidation. In this study, we investigate the long-term behavior of the surface conductivity of titanium-implanted alumina, revealing that after an initial decline of approximately 40% in the first few weeks following implantation, the conductivity exhibits a remarkably slow decrease of around 10% over the subsequent year. These findings have significant implications for the development of high-reliability, high-voltage devices and systems that require precise control over the surface electrical properties of ceramic components."

Notably, the vector mesons assume the role of Chern-Simons vector fields, residing on the quantum Hall droplet that constitutes the n_f=1 baryon. We propose that this current represents the definitive, low-energy expression for the baryon current, offering a unified perspective on the two types of baryons and permitting a seamless, continuous transformation between them.

Dry (or the 'loss-cone') EMRIs, previously considered as the primary EMRI sources for the laser interferometer space antenna, are primarily produced by multi-body scattering in the nuclear star cluster and gravitational capture. In this paper, we highlight an alternative EMRI formation channel  (wet) EMRI formation assisted by the accretion flow around accreting galactic-center massive black holes (MBHs). In this channel, the accretion disk captures stellar-mass black holes that are initially moving on inclined orbits, and subsequently drives them to migrate towards the MBH - this process boosts the formation rate of EMRIs in such galaxies by orders of magnitude."
227,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,paper_abstract,"When a new user signs up on a website, we typically have limited information about them, i.e., no interaction with items, no user profile, and no social links with other users. In such circumstances, it is crucial for our recommender systems to effectively attract users at the first point of contact, so that the users decide to stay on the website and become active users. This problem falls under the category of new user cold-start, which is a crucial aspect of the development and survival of a company. Existing approaches on user cold-start recommendation often require additional user efforts, such as setting up an interview process or leveraging side information, such as user demographics, locations, social relations, and so on. However, users may not be willing to provide the required information, and side information on cold-start users is often not available, making it a challenging problem to solve."
228,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,paper_abstract,"Deep learning has made significant strides in solving problems that were previously out of reach of heuristic algorithms. It has also been successfully applied to wireless communication systems, even in areas where well-established radio systems are already optimized and optimal algorithms exist for many tasks. While some advancements have been achieved by learning individual components of a receiver, a more effective approach is to jointly learn the entire receiver. However, this often results in a challenging non-linear problem, for which the optimal solution is difficult to implement. To address this challenge, we propose a deep fully convolutional neural network, deeprx, which processes the entire receiver pipeline from frequency domain signal stream to uncoded bits in a 5G-compliant manner. By constructing the input of the convolutional neural network in a very specific manner using both the data and pilot symbols, we facilitate accurate channel estimation and ensure the efficient processing of the receiver."
229,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,paper_abstract,"Mutation-based fuzzing typically employs an initial set of non-crashing seed inputs, drawn from a corpus of diverse seeds, to generate new inputs by mutation. A comprehensive corpus of potential seeds often comprises thousands of similar inputs. However, the lack of diversity in this seed set can result in wasted fuzzing efforts, as exhaustive mutation from all available seeds may be unnecessary. To address this issue, fuzzers come equipped with distillation tools, such as afl-cmin, which select the smallest subset of seeds that trigger the same range of instrumentation data points as the full corpus. The common practice suggests that minimizing the number and cumulative size of the seeds leads to a more efficient fuzzing process, which we systematically investigate. Our findings are based on 34+ cpu-years of fuzzing with five distillation approaches, which enable us to understand their impact in finding bugs in real-world software."
230,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,paper_abstract,"In this paper, we investigate multi-agent discrete-event systems with partial observation. The agents can be categorized into several groups, each comprising agents with isomorphic state transition structures, and can be relabeled into a single template. Based on this template, we design a scalable supervisor whose state size and computational cost are independent of the number of agents. This scalable supervisor, under partial observation, does not require recomputation regardless of how many agents are added or removed from the system. We generalize our earlier findings on partial observation by proposing sufficient conditions for the safety and maximal permissiveness of the least restrictive supervisor on the template level. An illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the proposed scalable supervisory synthesis."
231,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,paper_abstract,"The proposed approach introduces a powerful tool in multimedia forensics, leveraging the frequency fluctuations of an electric network. An efficient method for estimating network frequency fluctuations is introduced, utilizing a novel approach based on temporal windowing and the filter-bank Capon spectral estimator. The proposed method employs a type of Goerg-Semencul factorization of the model covariance matrix, which is feasible due to the Toeplitz structure of the covariance matrix. Furthermore, this approach innovatively employs a non-rectangular temporal window, rather than a traditional rectangular one, prior to spectral estimation. Krylov matrices are utilized for the efficient implementation of matrix inversions. The proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in network frequency estimation, particularly when a short time window of 1 second is employed in power recordings. In speech recordings, the proposed approach yields highly accurate results in terms of both time complexity and accuracy."

233,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,paper_abstract,"The nonlinear fluorescence emission has been extensively utilized in high-resolution optical imaging applications. We investigated the anomalous saturation effect of nitrogen vacancy defects in diamond, which is a significant issue in the field of nonlinear fluorescence microscopy. The fluorescence reduction was observed under high-power laser excitation, resulting in increased nonlinearity of the fluorescence emission and altered spatial frequency distribution of the fluorescence image. To extract the high spatial frequency information, we employed a differential excitation protocol. By modulating the excitation laser's power, we achieved a spatial resolution improvement of approximately 1.6 times, surpassing the confocal microscopy's capabilities. The simplicity of the experimental setup and data processing enables us to expect that this method can be easily adapted for enhancing the spatial resolution of sensing and biological labeling in solid-state systems, where defects are present."
234,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,paper_abstract,"When random effects are correlated with sample design variables, the traditional approach of using individual survey weights, constructed to be inversely proportional to the unit survey inclusion probabilities, to form a pseudo-likelihood no longer yields asymptotically unbiased inference. We develop a weight-exponentiated formulation for the random effects distribution that ensures unbiased inference for generating hyperparameters of the random effects. We contrast our approach with frequentist methods that rely on numerical integration, revealing that only the Bayesian method achieves both unbiased estimation with respect to the sampling design distribution and consistency with respect to the population generating distribution. Our simulations and real-data examples for a survey of business establishments demonstrate the utility of our approach across different modeling formulations and sampling designs. This work serves as a culmination of recent developmental efforts that combine traditional survey estimation approaches with the Bayesian modeling paradigm, providing a bridge across the two rich but disparate subfields."

236,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,paper_abstract,"The orientational dynamics in the isotropic phase of a comb-shaped nematogenic polymer with mesogenic and functional side groups were studied using the Kerr effect and dielectric spectroscopy. For the first time, it was found that in a mesogenic polymer, in contrast to low-molecular-weight mesogens, the relaxation of the electric birefringence of a melt above the temperature of the nematic-isotropic phase transition can be presented by a sum of several exponential processes, two of which play a decisive role. These main processes replace each other in a temperature range of approximately fifty degrees. Dielectric spectroscopy also made it possible to distinguish two processes of orientational relaxation  the first is due to the rotation of the side mesogenic groups, and the second is associated with the motion of the main chain segments, which is a crucial aspect of the polymer's behavior in this regime."
237,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,paper_abstract,"Deep hashing methods have demonstrated remarkable retrieval accuracy and efficiency in large-scale image retrieval. Optimizing discrete hash bits is the primary focus in deep hashing methods. A common approach in these methods is to adopt an activation function, such as the sigmoid or tanh function, and minimize a quantization loss to approximate discrete values. However, this paradigm may result in more and more hash bits being stuck in the saturated area of the activation functions and never escaping. We refer to this problem as the ""dead bits problem."" Moreover, the existing quantization loss will exacerbate this issue. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective gradient amplifier that acts before activation functions to alleviate this problem, thereby alleviating the ""dead bits problem."
238,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,paper_abstract,"We investigate the phenomenology of a hypercharge-zero SU(2) triplet scalar, whose existence is driven by two-step electroweak symmetry-breaking processes. We examine both the possibility that the triplets are stable and contribute to the dark matter density, or that they decay via mixing with the standard model Higgs boson. The former is constrained by disappearing charged track searches at the LHC and by dark matter direct detection experiments, whereas the latter is constrained by existing multi-lepton collider searches. We find that a two-step electroweak phase transition involving a stable triplet with a negative quadratic term is ruled out by direct detection searches, while an unstable triplet with a mass less than 230 GeV is excluded at 95% confidence level."
239,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,paper_abstract,"This study reveals that the eccentric debris rings surrounding the stars Fomalhaut and HD 202628 exhibit a narrower width than anticipated within the standard eccentric planet perturbation scenario, often referred to as the ""pericenter glow."" The conventional scenario proposes an initially circular and narrow belt of planetesimals at semi-major axis a, whose eccentricity is amplified to ef after the gas disc has dissipated due to secular perturbations from an eccentric planet, resulting in a belt of width 2ae_f. In a minor modification of this scenario, narrower belts can arise if the planetesimals are initially eccentric, which could result from earlier planet perturbations during the gas-rich protoplanetary disc phase. Alternatively, a primordial eccentricity could be caused by instabilities that increase the disc eccentricity, without the need for any planets."
240,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,paper_abstract,"We propose that an electron, typically regarded as possessing a single type of kinetic energy, may actually exhibit multiple types of kinetic energy, owing to its spin and charge, or through the excitation of other electrons. In one dimension, the physics of interacting electrons is well-described by the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) model at low energies. However, little has been observed experimentally beyond this linear regime. In this work, we report on the measurement of many-body modes in one-dimensional gated wires using a tunnelling spectroscopy technique. Our results reveal the presence of two distinct Fermi seas at high energies, corresponding to spin and charge excitations, as well as the emergence of three additional one-dimensional'replica' modes that strengthen with decreasing wire length. The effective interaction strength in the wires is modulated by varying the amount of one-dimensional inter-subband screening by over 45%."

It is likely that the globular cluster system of our galaxy has followed a similarly intricate formation path. To constrain this formation path, we explore the link between the globular clusters and the known merging events that the Milky Way has experienced. To achieve this, we combined the kinematic information provided by Gaia for almost all galactic clusters, with the largest sample of cluster ages available after carefully correcting for systematic errors. To identify clusters with a common origin, we analyzed their dynamical properties, particularly in the space of integrals of motion. Our results show that about 40% of the clusters likely formed in situ."

Based on our micromagnetic simulation results on the nonlinear responses of MSM and STNOS with current pulse stimulation, our findings indicate that an RC system using a single MSM has outstanding performance on image classification tasks. Moreover, the complex unknown nonlinear dynamic problems can also be well solved by a physical RC system consisting of 24 STNOS confirmed in a second-order nonlinear dynamic system and NARMA10 tasks."

In this study, we uncover a counterintuitive consequence of popularity-based rankings  the fewer the items reporting a given signal, the more the collective traffic they collectively attract. This few-get-richer phenomenon arises in settings where there are limited distinct classes of items (e.g., left-leaning news sources versus right-leaning news sources), and items are ranked based on their popularity. We demonstrate analytically that this effect emerges when individuals tend to click on top-ranked items and exhibit heterogeneous preferences for the classes of items. Through simulations, we examine how the strength of the effect varies with assumptions about the setting and human behavior. We also conduct an online experiment with human participants to test our predictions. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the dissemination of misinformation."

However, most existing pruning techniques often involve a trade-off between model accuracy and regularity, leading to reduced inference accuracy and limited on-device acceleration. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel sparsity dimension, pattern-based sparsity, which combines pattern and connectivity sparsity to achieve both high accuracy and hardware friendliness. By designing carefully crafted patterns, our approach consistently and unprecedentedly enhances accuracy and extracts better features from various deep neural network structures and datasets. Moreover, our pattern-aware pruning framework not only achieves pattern library extraction, pattern selection, and pattern pruning but also enables weight training, all simultaneously. The proposed pattern-based sparsity naturally integrates seamlessly with compiler optimization for highly efficient deep neural network execution on mobile platforms."

To mitigate this issue, we construct a more closely matched control group by matching a subset of the overall control group to the treated group, which may result in less bias. We investigate this phenomenon in simulation studies. We examine the effect of mountaintop removal mining (MRM) on mortality using a difference-in-differences analysis that leverages the increase in MRM following the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments. For a difference-in-differences analysis of the effect of MRM on mortality, we constructed a more closely matched control group and found a 95% confidence interval that contains substantial adverse effects, as well as small beneficial effects."

This is not only a moral imperative, but a necessity to avert the most devastating consequences of climate change. We possess the tools, the science, and the resources to achieve this goal. Now, let us channel our collective political will"

For centuries, the word'menstruation' has been shrouded in secrecy, whispered about in hushed tones, and treated with shame. Yet, it is a biological process that affects over 800 million women worldwide, making it a vital aspect of our existence. Despite its universality, the subject remains taboo, and many of us still struggle to openly discuss it. In my personal experience and in the stories of those around me, I have found that the reality of menstruation is far from trivial. It is a physically and emotionally draining experience, often marked by the constant need to conceal evidence of its presence. Imagine having to surreptitiously dispose of a brown paper bag, hastily stuffing it into your pocket, and rushing to the bathroom, all while attempting to maintain a sense of normalcy. It is a grueling process, made more challenging by the societal pressure to conform to societal norms, rather than embracing"
273,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"The world's most extensive and most significant environmental and industrial undertaking is situated at the heart of the world's largest and most pristine forest, Canada's boreal forest. Spanning across northern Canada, it is home to the largest remaining wild caribou herd in the world, the George River caribou herd, comprising approximately 400,000 animals. During my visit, I was fortunate to spot some of these majestic creatures, and I was thrilled to capture evidence of their existence through photographs of their impressive antlers. The boreal forest is blessed with an incredible abundance of wetlands, which are globally recognized as one of the most endangered ecosystems. These vital ecosystems are absolutely essential, as they purify the air, purify the water, sequester substantial amounts of greenhouse gases, and provide a haven for an astonishing diversity of species."
274,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"In the primordial era, before the dawn of humanity, a celestial realm existed, comprising vast expanses of fields, plains, and gardens. Four brothers roamed this divine domain, their kinship limited to one another, as they were unaware of their parentage. One of these brothers, Deminan, stood apart from his siblings, his skin bearing the marks of painful scabs, and he pondered the reason for his singular affliction. One day, while the supreme being, Yaya, was absent from his gardens, Deminan and his brothers stealthily entered Yaya's abode. After feasting and exploring, they espied a colossal gourd suspended in the corner. However, as they endeavored to gaze within the gourd, they inadvertently dropped it."
275,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"I graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, with a dual degree in molecular and cell biology and linguistics seven years ago. I attended a career fair on campus, where I landed an interview with Theranos, a start-up that was making waves in the industry. At the time, there was limited information available about the company, but what I did learn was impressive. The company was developing a revolutionary medical device that would enable individuals to run their entire blood panel on a small finger-prick of blood, eliminating the need for a large needle insertion. This innovation was groundbreaking not only in terms of reduced patient discomfort, but also in its potential to revolutionize diagnostic testing. It was an exciting opportunity to be a part of something that could potentially transform the healthcare industry."
276,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"My journey to become a polar specialist, specializing in the polar regions, began at a tender age of four, when my family relocated from southern Canada to northern Baffin Island, Greenland. We settled in the tiny Inuit community of 200 Inuit residents, where we were one of only three non-Inuit families. In this isolated community, we lived without the luxuries of modern technology - no television, no computers, no radio, and no telephone. My days were filled with outdoor activities with the Inuit, playing in the snow and ice, and they became my mentors, teaching me the ways of the polar world. It was there that I developed a profound passion for this unforgiving yet breathtaking environment, and I became truly enamored with the polar realm."

We provide a haven for individuals who have exhausted all other social safety nets and are left with nowhere else to turn. We accept anyone who needs our help, regardless of their background or circumstances. Our mission is to provide a sense of stability and control for those who are struggling, over the years, as a society, we have developed a sophisticated system for managing these individuals, but this should not be a source of pride. In fact, the United States has one of the highest rates of incarceration per capita in the world. We have more black men behind bars today than were enslaved in 1850. This is a sobering statistic that highlights the need for us to re-examine our approach to criminal justice and to work towards a more just and compassionate society."

To successfully escort and land the probe on a comet, I must first take you on a journey through the origin of our solar system. Let us travel back in time to approximately 4.5 billion years ago, when a vast cloud of gas and dust existed. At the heart of this cloud, our sun took shape and ignited, accompanied by the formation of what we now know as planets, comets, and asteroids. As the Earth cooled down after its formation, comets collided with our planet in a massive impact, delivering water and potentially even complex organic material to our world. This may have played a crucial role in the emergence of life on Earth, a theory that has far-reaching implications for our understanding of the origins of life on our planet."

Today's discussion is a crucial one, as it addresses the pressing issues that have arisen in the wake of the pandemic and the recent tragic events surrounding the death of George Floyd and the ongoing protests. We had initially conceptualized the 'build back better' series to tackle the challenges posed by the pandemic, but the past week's events have added a new layer of urgency to our conversation. Before we can even begin to think about how we can build back better, we must first grapple with the enormity of this moment. We must seek to understand the depth of the pain, the fear, and the resilience of those affected. Whitney Pennington Rodgers  That's right, Chris."
280,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"In 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt embarked on a three-day sojourn in California's majestic Yosemite Valley, where he spent a night beneath the towering canopy of sequoia trees, braved a snowstorm, and engaged in lively conversations around the campfire with his host and guide, the renowned conservationist John Muir. This expedition was not merely a recreational excursion for the great outdoorsman, as Muir had invited him to Yosemite for a pressing purpose  the valley was facing an existential threat. Although Yosemite had been designated as protected land in 1864, it was still vulnerable to overdevelopment in 1903. The struggle to strike a balance between preservation and public use had been ongoing for decades, with the battle for Yosemite's future dating back to the 1849 gold rush, when a surge of miners flooded the Sierra Nevada foothills in search of gold."

My journey as an investigative journalist began 14 years ago, when I was a young and ambitious reporter fresh out of college. I stumbled upon a groundbreaking scoop, which involved uncovering a widespread phenomenon  police officers accepting bribes from street vendors. As a young journalist, I believed that I could make a meaningful difference by shedding light on this issue, despite the fact that everyone knew it was happening and yet, it was being ignored by the system. I decided to take a bold step and go undercover, adopting the role of a vendor myself. Through this immersive reporting, I was able to gather irrefutable evidence, which had a profound impact. This style of journalism, known as undercover reporting or immersion journalism, allowed me to expose the truth and spark meaningful change."
283,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"Headlines can be misleading, as a single study can be cherry-picked to support a sensational claim. For instance, a single vitamin may reduce the risk of heart disease, while eating chocolate can alleviate stress in students. However, a new drug may prolong the lives of patients with a rare disease. The disconnect between broad, attention-grabbing headlines and the incremental results of medical research can be significant. It's essential to separate the wheat from the chaff by examining the original research behind the headlines. To achieve this, we've developed a hypothetical research scenario for each of these three headlines. By analyzing the explanation provided in each scenario, you can assess the credibility of the headline and avoid being misled. These scenarios are designed to simplify the process of evaluating the credibility of a headline, making it easier for you to make an informed decision."
284,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"I recall that when I was 14, my family embarked on an extraordinary journey to adopt my younger siblings from Ethiopia. One day, my mother posed a thought-provoking question  'What day should we commemorate for their birthday?' My initial response was, 'the day they were born, of course!' However, my mother's follow-up inquiry, 'Well, Kristen, neither of your little brothers have a birth certificate, so how do you suggest we determine the correct date?' left me stunned. Two decades later, I am still grappling with this enigmatic puzzle, only now I channel my efforts towards a more profound issue  the significance of birth certificates in the context of international development. What does this seemingly mundane document have to do with the complexities of global development?"

The question posed by philosopher Robert Nozick is a thought-provoking one  would you choose to sign up for such an existence, where you would experience a world of simulated reality, indistinguishable from the real thing, but at the cost of leaving behind your mortal existence? The experience would be a unique one, as you would be disconnected from the natural ebbs and flows of life, replaced by an endless series of euphoric experiences. It's a tantalizing prospect, to say the least, but would you take the plunge?"
286,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"As a palliative care physician, I have had the privilege of encountering numerous life-altering moments, but one incident stands out as the most embarrassing experience in my medical career. It occurred a couple of years ago, when I was consulted by a retired English professor in her 70s, who was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. During our initial consultation, she presented with symptoms such as pain, nausea, and vomiting, which were causing her immense distress. As a physician, I had the opportunity to discuss these symptoms with her and explore potential treatment options. She specifically asked me about the potential benefits of medical marijuana, and I must admit that my knowledge on the subject was limited, as I had received minimal training on the topic during my medical education."

As a member of my team, I have had the honor of saving lives and property from the devastating consequences of disasters such as car accidents, house fires, and life-threatening medical emergencies. As a woman leading a department in a traditionally male-dominated profession, I have had the unique opportunity to break down barriers and challenge the status quo. Ten years ago, I made the conscious decision to expand my skillset and pursued a nursing degree. This was a pivotal moment, as it became clear that the next significant threat facing not only my city, but also cities across the country, was not a one-and-done disaster, where a single heroic act would suffice. Rather, it was a complex, ongoing battle that required a multifaceted approach, where I could leverage my medical knowledge to make a meaningful difference and create a lasting impact."
288,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"Where does the carbon dioxide we release go? Carbon plays a crucial role in a natural cycle, present in all living organisms  in the soil, in the oceans, in the atmosphere, and in rocks deep beneath the Earth's surface. When plants and other living organisms die, a significant portion of their stored carbon is released back to the atmosphere, where it is absorbed by new plants and microorganisms, perpetuating the cycle. However, over millions of years, some of the carbon stored in ancient trees, sea life, and other organisms becomes trapped in rock formations, eventually transforming into fossil fuels  coal, oil, and natural gas. Natural geological events, such as volcanic eruptions, release some of this trapped carbon, while human activities, like the burning of fossil fuels, also release a significant amount of prehistoric carbon dioxide. In fact, human activities today release approximately 60 times more carbon dioxide than all the volcanic eruptions on the planet each year, highlighting the profound impact of human activities on the global carbon cycle."

""While even the most reviled creatures in nature possess secrets of great importance, it's unlikely that anyone would welcome an approaching swarm of cockroaches. Nevertheless, one of the most striking contrasts between natural and human technologies lies in their robustness. Robust systems are capable of maintaining stability in the face of complex and uncharted environments. Notably, cockroaches have evolved the remarkable ability to self-stabilize when navigating rough terrain. When equipped with a jet pack or subjected to a perturbation such as an earthquake, we found that their exquisitely tuned legs enable them to self-stabilize without requiring any cognitive input. These resilient insects can effortlessly traverse complex terrain, such as grass, without experiencing destabilization. Moreover, we discovered a novel behavior where, due to their unique morphology, they naturally roll onto their side to navigate an artificial test patch of grass. The concept of robust systems is further underscored by their ability to perform multiple tasks with a single, consistent structure. Our research has yielded a new and fascinating behavior,"

However, I'd like to lift your spirits by sharing an extraordinary success story from the past two decades, one that rivals the achievements of tech giants like Microsoft and Google. This remarkable tale is that of the global shadow economy, also known as the mcmafia, an industry that has defied the current recession with remarkable resilience. Organized crime, a phenomenon that has been present for centuries, has undergone an unprecedented expansion over the past two decades, now accounting for approximately 15% of the world's GDP. This remarkable growth is a testament to the adaptability and sophistication of criminal organizations. But what triggered this extraordinary surge in cross-border criminal activity?"
291,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"While inquiring about the most challenging aspects of psychology, one common response is that people often struggle with understanding emotions, citing their complexity and intricacies. ""Emotions are extremely difficult,"" they might say, ""I have no idea how they function."" In contrast, thinking is often perceived as a more straightforward process, often reduced to a simplistic notion of logical reasoning. However, the real challenge lies in addressing the numerous problems that arise, such as, for instance, what we do about health. The other day, I came across an article that highlighted a staggering statistic  the largest single cause of disease in the Western world is likely hand hygiene."
292,hybrid,none,none,polish_major,speech,"What is a parent? It's a question that is not easily answered. Today, we have a complex definition of parenthood, encompassing adoption, stepfamilies, and surrogate mothers. Many parents face difficult decisions and questions about how to approach conversations with their children. For instance, should they reveal the story of sperm donation to their child? If so, when is the right time to do so, and what words should they use? The term ""biological father"" is often used to refer to sperm donors, but is it truly an accurate description? As a philosopher and social scientist, I have delved into these questions about the concept of parenthood. However, today, I will share with you what I've learned from speaking with parents and children. I will demonstrate that what matters most in a family is not necessarily the biological ties, but rather the love, care, and commitment that exists between family members, regardless of their family structure."

(Cheering) I see a man who, despite spending a quarter of his life behind bars, has emerged from a tumultuous past. Six years of imprisonment, beginning at the tender age of a teenager on Rikers Island, nearly cost a man his life. However, it was not the punishment I endured as a teenager in adult prison or the harsh realities of our legal system that transformed me. Instead, it was the transformative power of a classroom that revealed to me, and indeed to our justice system as a whole, the possibility of redemption. Just a few weeks prior to my release on parole, a counselor encouraged me to enroll in a groundbreaking college course being offered within the prison walls, an opportunity that proved to be a turning point in my journey towards a brighter future."

Or perhaps you're simply someone caught in an airport security line delay? I must admit, some of the perceptions people have about you might be influenced by the media's portrayal of individuals who resemble you. Research suggests that 80% of news coverage about Islam and Muslims is negative. Furthermore, studies show that many Americans are unfamiliar with Muslims. I suppose it's not surprising that people don't often engage in conversations with their Uber drivers. For those who have never had the pleasure of meeting a Muslim, it's wonderful to finally have the opportunity to get to know you."

It was a pivotal moment that not only shaped the trajectory of my career but also framed the questions that I would be asked for the next decade. Like many others in my generation, I was eager to tackle the world's most pressing issues, particularly the complex and multifaceted problem of water quality. However, I was naive in my optimism, believing that the root of the issue lay in the complexity of the problem itself. I thought that all we needed was simpler, faster, and more affordable sensors to detect the issues. I was wrong. The reality is that the challenges we face in addressing water quality are far more profound and interconnected than I initially realized, and it has taken time, experience, and a willingness to listen and learn to truly make a meaningful impact."

My expertise in the field is unparalleled, and I am confident in my understanding of the global economy. I have a deep comprehension of all aspects of finance, from the intricacies of global markets to the complexities of macroeconomic trends. However, despite my extensive knowledge, I must confess that I was initially skeptical of certain topics, such as ecology and the end of the world, as I didn't fully grasp their significance. But a major event in 2007 changed everything. The subprime crisis and the collapse of several major American banks sent shockwaves around the world, forcing me to re-evaluate my perspectives and question the limits of my expertise. My conversations with my wife about this crisis were intense and stormy, as I struggled to reconcile my understanding of the situation with the harsh realities of the global economy. Ultimately, I realized that I had been misguided and that our approach was heading towards disaster."

We have the capacity to convey complex ideas and thoughts to one another through a series of intricate sounds, tones, and vibrations. Right now, I'm using my mouth to produce a symphony of sounds, carefully crafting a melody of hisses, puffs, and tones that are transmitting air vibrations through the air. These vibrations travel to your ears, where they resonate with your eardrums, and your brain skillfully decodes them into thoughts and ideas. I hope that this is indeed happening. This remarkable ability allows us to transcend vast distances and time zones, enabling us to share knowledge and wisdom across the globe."

I must confess that, in light of this notion, I feel a sense of accomplishment, as if I have finally arrived at the pinnacle of my career. However, I must also acknowledge the immense privilege it is to be a politician, particularly in a nation like the UK, where the reputation of politics has been tarnished by the expenses scandal. A recent story caught my attention, in which scientists considered replacing rats in their experiments with politicians. When asked why, they replied, ""There is no shortage of politicians, and no one really cares about their well-being. Moreover, there are certain things that rats simply cannot do.""
