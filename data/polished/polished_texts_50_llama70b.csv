1,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Another week has flown by. I drove by the new house yesterday and noticed the front window was covered in boxes. We may receive the keys at closing, and I'm getting increasingly excited. If all goes well this week, we'll be set for closing a week from Wednesday. I was up late last night, watching movies with Bethany until after 3:00am. There's been a lot of movie watching lately. Here's my rundown: last night we watched Thirteen, a movie every mother of a teen should see. It exceeded my expectations. Then we watched Gigli, which was just as bad as the media said, but we had to see it for ourselves."
2,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Summer TV used to be a dead zone filled with repeats, but now there are two great new shows that I've been watching religiously for the past week. One of them is 'Blow Out,' a show with a concept that seems to have zero gay people involved, despite its title. The show revolves around hairstylist Jonathan Antin, who wants to build a second location for his popular West Hollywood salon in Beverly Hills. Normally, this wouldn't be of interest to me, but while flipping through channels, I caught a glimpse of Jonathan speaking in a public voice, 'I'm going to build the greatest salon in the history of the world ever!' in an empty space on Rodeo Drive. His equal mix of narcissism and dullness has me hooked. Not since 'Rocco' have I found such a compelling, yet moronic, TV personality to watch."
3,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"What a week... I've developed tendonitis in my right shoulder, just under my shoulder blade. When I move my arm excessively, particularly when using a computer mouse, it's excruciating. I've had to limit my movement due to a recent marathon of updating my website and working on other online projects. As a result, I'm struggling to muster the strength to draw. Lack of sleep is exacerbating the pain. I'm not in the best spirits, but I'm optimistic about recovery. On a more positive note, my mom's surgery was successful. Her eyesight has partially returned, allowing her to see fuzzy shapes and distinguish colors. Although she's still largely blind, I'm hopeful she'll regain her full vision soon."
4,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Kindness of strangers... I attempted to do laundry today with the kids in tow and quickly realized how the simplest tasks can become a chaotic ordeal. I also discovered how remarkably kind total strangers can be, simply because they feel like being sweet. It wasn't like they had ulterior motives; I was covered in kid drool and wearing my casual 'wash-day' outfit. I'm not sure I'll be bathing again anytime soon, so there wasn't even an olfactory incentive. Currently, I'm multitasking - composing this post and watching No Doubt's collected music videos, both from the comfort of my desk in my room."
5,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"It's 11:14pm MST, and I'm sitting in my bedroom, fixing the personal computer of our personnel director from work. I don't mind doing favors, but I often wonder how frequently I end up fixing someone else's computer. I'm glad to be able to show love and care for people in this way. However, I sometimes question where the line is drawn before I'm taken advantage of. The last couple of weeks, I've been staying up late reading, so I was looking forward to an early night. Instead, I realized it would be more prudent to return the computer to its owner. No rest for the weary, right? I found myself watching Joe Schmo 2 again tonight, as I sit here working."
6,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Remind me, what did I write about before this? Or, a continuation in the 'is this a date?' saga. So, after the weird lunch, my confidence took a hit. I forgot to share an important part of the story with you guys. Before Pat arrived for lunch, Dustin started talking about what a great guy Pat is and how he's trying to find him a girlfriend. I listened and nodded, realizing we were discussing finding Dustin's best friend a partner more than getting to know each other over pink lemonade. I excused myself to the bathroom, looked in the mirror, and silently asked myself: am I being pawned off to the other guy? Is this what happens now?"
7,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"I would like everyone to think before they act. Ideally, I'd like each person to make a conscious decision to think critically from the moment they wake up, and maintain that mindset throughout the day. If they're not willing to do so, I wish they would reconsider their daily activities. I'm frustrated with the lack of critical thinking in the world. I'm not claiming to be the most intelligent person, but I believe it's reasonable to expect a basic level of thoughtfulness. I'm not referring to complex issues, but rather simple, everyday decisions. Let's focus on a few specific examples for now, and save the rest for another time, if that sounds agreeable."
8,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Two issues with the scenario outlined in my previous post: 1. While it's true that Bush is stimulating the economy, he's doing so in an ineffective manner. Robert Rubin, in an interview with NPR's Marketplace, suggested that the same stimulus effect could have been achieved without incurring long-term debt by implementing temporary tax cuts that benefit low and middle-income individuals. The mention of Robert Rubin's name is indeed reassuring. Can you think of a Bush administration cabinet official on the domestic side who possesses similar gravitas? 2. We cannot afford to give Republicans control solely during wartime, as they have cleverly created a perpetual, global 'war on terrorism.'"
10,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Do you ever have one of those moments when you begin to reflect on life? Like you're sitting in math class, feeling utterly bored, and you wonder what exactly goes on in your brain that enables you to comprehend math? You realize that you exist, and you're in math class, and you wonder why. Then you realize how amazing existing is. And suddenly it hits you - the fact that you're going off on this random train of thought is incredibly pathetic. Ever had that happen? I hate that. You know what else I dislike? Block schedules. Who would ever come up with that idea? Sitting through a two and a half hour class in any subject is, in my opinion, a form of cruel and unusual punishment. Anyone can see that."
11,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"I think Monopoly has run its course in my life, and I vow to never touch that iron game piece again. Tonight, Andy beat me by a few dollars and won the game, or perhaps I let him win since he's leaving in a few hours and I wanted him to feel good on his last night here. Whatever the story may be, it can't compare to this Texas-sized headache I have at the moment. I've taken some Aleve, and I must say they're doing the trick. All I need now is some well-deserved rest and relaxation. Your telephone's the one that helped me wrap the cord around your neck... At the drive-in."
12,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Today's been a long day, having driven home from Indiana. I'll have to be selective about what I write, as I could easily fill a lot of space and time, but I'm running low on energy. To start, I must say that camp exceeded my expectations - it was truly awesome. Lately, God has been doing incredible things in my life, and it's amazing. I've made a positive change, but I'll get back to the beginning. We arrived at the Twiggs' house on Friday evening and stayed until we left for camp on Monday. During our visit, we attended the fair, church, a parade, went to Walmart, and watched movies."
13,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Today is my last day of summer vacation, and I'm filled with a mix of emotions. I have a dentist appointment at 9, which I'm not thrilled about, but I'd rather get it over with now than try to schedule it during the first month of my surgery rotation. I'm definitely nervous and apprehensive about the upcoming school year. As a perfectionist, I thrive on excelling in everything I do, but starting new things can be overwhelming. I dislike feeling uncertain and out of control, like a pawn on a chessboard. I've always been someone who likes to take charge and make my own moves, but this new chapter is uncharted territory for me."
14,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Arun Shourie discusses how the current Governor of Uttar Pradesh had warned as far back as 1996 about the impending threat of the rise of a 'third Islamic state' in the subcontinent. T V Rajeswar, the former head of the Intelligence Bureau and the present Governor of Uttar Pradesh, had predicted this dire threat in a series of articles published in the Hindustan Times in 1996. Shourie raises a valid point when he questions whether the fact that Rajeswar, rather than he or Mr. Advani, wrote these warnings makes them more credible. Alternatively, does the fact that Rajeswar expressed these concerns mean that he is a closet communalist and should be removed as Governor of Uttar Pradesh?"
15,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Attitude: bored, mood: indifferent, looking forward to tonight. It's been a long, arduous day in the trenches, leaving little time to write for our readers. However, it's great to see Tigger (now Akcron) taking the reins and making an appearance, discussing various topics. Yesterday's Shakespeare on the Green was a lovely play, although I had to leave before the closing curtain, which was disappointing. Hopefully, I'll get to see a complete Shakespeare play someday. Akcron is right about the shower issues; it's a problem. As for laughing at her in the shower, the look people get when inflicting self-torture can be quite amusing. Not much to say today, but it's good to see Akcron stepping up."
16,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"All of a sudden, I've been overcome with terrible bouts of exhaustion for the past two days. It's a bone-dead exhaustion. Last evening, I went home and slept off, only getting up when my mother called me around 8:30. When I woke up, it was dark, and I hadn't switched the lights on, so I couldn't figure out the time or date for a few seconds. It was just my mother's voice in the darkness, and me grappling with reality. I'm still wondering why I'm feeling so drained. The weather was nice this morning, though - it was drizzling when I arrived. Although, I hear it's been raining in Calcutta for the past three days."
17,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Last night was the worst. I discarded the sweater I was knitting. I had only completed about 14 inches. I lost approximately $10 worth of yarn, which costs $8 per skein. However, the project had too many stitches by the time I reached the arm holes, and the mohair was knotting itself together as I knitted. As a result, frogging didn't work well, and the yarn broke frequently. I remained surprisingly calm, which is unusual for me. I morosely ripped out the rows while listening to season two of Sex and the City, courtesy of the library. Eventually, I grew tired of it and threw it away. I suppose I could say I gained valuable experience from attempting to make this sweater."
18,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Last night in class, we discussed that week's assigned reading, ""Getting Back into Place: Toward a Renewed Study of the Place-World"" by Edward S. Casey. The first chapter explores ""implacement"" and the second, ""displacement."" Casey distinguishes that our contemporary world and culture revolve around time as the situating force: we're running out of time, we've saved time, we're just in time. He argues that using place as the center of culture fosters a more grounded community. This is a rough summation, so I offer this disclaimer in case my professor or classmates read this post. Notably, this book is the first reading that has truly resonated with me."
19,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Whatever it is they put into freeze pops to make them those colours, there should be some sort of warning: may make your life a bit bizarre. And whilst giggling is good, one wonders if we would have found ourselves up that fire escape drinking beer in the fierce wind had we not been eating them earlier. Finding ourselves in a doorway to a bar sadly closed for business, we stopped to examine an office-supplies catalogue that had arrived in the post. Lucky we did. Who could possibly have guessed that within these pages were the special offers of a lifetime? Not I, for certain. I list but a few: buy 36 permanent marker pens and receive a stunt kite. Buy 30 lever arch files and receive a barbecue."
20,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Currently listening to: ""The Little Drummer Boy"" by Stevan Pasero. Now, onto my post. Senate Republicans, hands up - who watched the 39-hour judicial nominations debacle last week? I know I didn't, although I did tune in briefly once or twice. The entire colossal waste of time was orchestrated by Republicans who, upset that Democrats wouldn't nominate four of Bush's contentious justices, sought to score political points by holding a multi-day protest. Despite the fact that Democrats have already approved 168 of Bush's judicial nominees, this wasn't enough for the power-hungry Republicans, who seem to be under the misconception that they have a huge mandate for such actions."
21,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"This was a good weekend. I spent a lot of time outdoors, after a long time, and I listened to a lot of Nevermore (something I should have started doing much earlier) and read extensively. I finished three books over the weekend - Bruce Sterling's Heavy Weather, Larry Niven's World of Ptavvs, and Octavia Butler's Parable of the Sower. Heavy Weather was a good cyberpunk romp through a near-future USA, devastated by global warming and general anarchy. While it was clever, well-paced, and altogether very convincing, I must confess that I failed to come away with any really significant sensations about the story or the characters. Not that both aren't well constructed and vividly etched - it's a good book, but not a great one, I guess."
22,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"The aftermath of the first week back from practicum was a struggle, but it's only in the second week that the smoke has really started to clear. Post-practicum trauma, a hidden epidemic, is only now coming to light. I was stricken, but a meeting with the course co-ordinator allowed me to release my burden. By doing so, I have prevented another person from being stuck with a pedagogically deficit practicum school. Yesterday, I bumped into another aggrieved classmate who was determined to warn the student due to attend her school in the next practicum about the terrible experience. I calmed her down, suggesting we should first approach the administrator."
23,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Things are incredibly busy here at times, but there's always time for supposed stress-relieving activities. I've discovered that I'm not very skilled at 8-ball and ping pong. Rick, the Canadian, consistently beats me - we have a ping pong table in the front lobby of our building, allowing for a quick game whenever we want. Last night, I participated in an 8-ball tournament at the recreation tent, which we call the hot spot. It's equipped with a popcorn machine, multiple TVs, a jukebox, DVD rental, a pool table, a dartboard, and a ping pong table. I did fairly well throughout my one game, until I scratched on the eight ball. Despite that, I still had a good time, especially with the two Dutch soldiers who joined the tournament."
24,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Fall 1974: I was attempting, for what felt like the 13th time, to fight my way through the second chapter of my high school algebra book. I was not then, nor am I now, a math person. I have an aversion to math, and it's safe to say I'm math-phobic. As I struggled to make sense of algebra, the doorbell rang. I put down my book and went to open the door, only to find no one there. I returned to my studies, and just as I was finding a glimmer of understanding, the doorbell rang again. My breakthrough vanished instantly. I went to the door, and once again, no one was there. Just what a struggling math student needs - an uninvited practical joker."
25,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"This past week has been nothing short of exhausting. I spent Tuesday to Thursday finishing the move to my new classroom. The new room is bigger and closer to my grade level team, which are essential factors to consider as I spend hours preparing my room for this year. Had I known about the move prior to the end of my school year, I would have discarded many of the books and supplies I no longer use. Unfortunately, it all came with me. So this week was spent moving, unpacking, and purging extensively. I have to thank my teammate Jill for her assistance with all of this. You see, she was still teaching this month in my old room. Her lovely students moved almost my entire room for me, which was a huge help."

Even if I never carried your child, even if I was never married to you, even if we were never an official pair... I loved you immensely, and to this day the feeling carries an echo through my heart. Forever will I always be reminded of the few nights we spent together, our hearts and limbs entwined in a soul-embrace, drenched in the salty darkness of an evening by the beach... or a kiss under the rain. Whenever I feel the pain of a dark glass puncturing my heart, you will be there. That piece of you... still bleeding the eternal love that once lived in me... and still remains. For heri"
27,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"I'm uncomfortable with investigative reporting, or rather, the article I'm working on and its consequences. I'm not entirely convinced, which makes it difficult for me to fully grasp the underlying emotions and passion that drive it. The angst and questioning that come with it don't quite resonate with me. Growing up in a country where questioning authority was discouraged, I was taught not to ask questions. In fact, doing so could lead to severe repercussions, including imprisonment under internal security acts. I'm still adjusting to the freedom of speech and openly expressing my doubts. Admittedly, I'm not the easiest person to get along with."
28,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"We had an outing yesterday with my co-employees at the bank. We visited Guintubdan, La Carolota, a destination most of us had never been to before. We embarked on a trek to the falls, which took around 30 minutes, leaving us all breathless. However, the scenic view was well worth the effort. The icy water was invigorating, causing our bodies to numb from the cold. We only stayed for less than an hour before heading to the nearby waterfalls, another 30-minute trek. The trip was worth it, as the falls appeared calming and the entire scene was breathtaking. It felt like being one with nature, and the experience was almost meditative. Soaking in the cold water was like communing with Mother Earth. The cold air and water were enough to make you feel drowsy. We were all catching our breaths. Whew! but we made it. You can feel your body getting numb because of the coldness. The whole scene is indeed breathtaking. Its like you can hear yourself being one with nature."

With only a month left before Ed leaves, I think the reality is starting to sink in for him and the rest of us. For me, it's been a long time coming. I just hope Ed will be here for Bailey's surgery.

Fortunately, I had brought a bag of eggs as a precaution. Connor had a great time searching for eggs in the park. On Sunday morning, he woke up excited, believing the Easter bunny had visited. There's nothing more heartwarming than seeing the excitement on a child's face. After the egg hunt, we attended church. Although the Easter bunny is fun, we ensure our kids understand the true meaning of the holidays. This was Megan's first Easter, and she looked adorable in her jean dress and stockings."

I somehow managed to get a flat tire. Luckily, I'm at work, so the guys are going to inflate it for me and check if it holds air. If not, they'll change my tire and put the spare on.

Parents often believe they know their children extremely well, even to the point of reading their emotions. However, this isn't always the case. They may not truly understand us. After a recent argument with Nicole about Kelli, I went upstairs, and my parents asked what was wrong. I felt like saying, 'Can't you just give me some space?' I don't owe them an explanation every time. The situation with Nicole and Kelli is simple: they don't get along. At all. They have a strong dislike for each other."

Fortunately, I skillfully maneuvered my car from the far left lane to the far right and managed to get onto Route 50. This may not be relevant to anyone outside of the area, so I'll spare the details. I'm relieved to be sitting here instead of stuck in my car. Yesterday, Sara decided to Google me and discovered that an email I wrote to Ivan Maisel on ESPN.com was published online.

I went to see it right after school on Friday, which happened to be the opening day - thanks to Mike for the ticket. Daniel Radcliffe, aka Harry Potter, has grown up incredibly fast and is quite charming. Malfoy too, haha. The movie was all great, but I give it 4 1/2 stars because they left out some important details. Overall, the movie was good.

I've just returned from an evening out at my old music teacher's house, where I had a good time catching up with my friend. I did miss a show, but I recorded it.

Observers will come from the OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights. This will be the first time such a team has been present for a U.S. presidential election. A group of congressional Democrats, including four New Yorkers, has petitioned U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to dispatch international observers to Florida to oversee this year's presidential balloting there. I humbly disagree. Based on the available information, the OSCE seems to be coming to learn from the U.S. election process, not to oversee it, which was the original partisan and childish call for U.N."

I'm also relieved that I don't have to work this morning, but I do need to call a man at KMIZ to obtain his rate card.

By Gary Fineout and Alfonso Chardy, a citizenship ceremony in Jacksonville appeared to proceed normally, with nearly 200 people leaving as new Americans. Before the new citizens departed the June 29 event, an immigration official overseeing the swearing-in ceremony encouraged them to visit a voter registration table, a common sight at naturalization ceremonies. However, this table was unusual, as Republican volunteers were distributing forms with the party affiliation box pre-checked to register new voters as GOP members. Linda Cross, who attended to watch her husband, Dario Cruz, take his citizenship oath, found the situation suspicious. The citizenship ceremony in Jacksonville seemed to go off as usual, with a crowd of nearly 200 people going home as new americans. Just before the new citizens left the june 29 event, an immigration official directing the swearing-in urged them to stop by a voter registration table -- a not uncommon sight at naturalization ceremonies. But this table was unusual: those handing out forms were republican volunteers -- and the party affiliation box had been checked off ahead of time to make all of the new voters members of the gop. All of it was suspicious to linda cross, who was there to watch her husband, dario cruz, take his citizenship oath."

I'm taking a couple of days off to simply unwind. Nothing like 48 hours of daydreaming to recharge my creative energy. As a foreigner, I have it relatively good, and my timing was fortunate. The illustration aspect is the icing on the cake – I'd probably complain more if that hadn't fallen into place. I'm aware that I'm not being fairly compensated, though.

44,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"I liked the idea of that as an offense - perhaps it could have been a way to avoid being burned as a witch. As a non-American blogger, I've been hesitant to engage in discussions about certain topics, especially those involving flags. However, since I initiated the subject, I suppose I should share my thoughts. Firstly, I believe that having a law against flag-burning is completely absurd. The moment you grant a symbol - any symbol - automatic reverence and protection, you've taken a small but significant step towards totalitarianism. Symbols are inherently subjective - they don't inherently represent anything; it's the perceived meaning or assigned representation that holds importance. The idea of having a law against flag-burning is completely nuts. Symbols are kind of fickle; it's what they are perceived as meaning or made to represent that's important."

I was inspired by a blogger, who managed to keep us up to date in the most intimate fashion about her day-to-day existence, and somewhat entertained at the same time.

Although I'm too exhausted to delve into specifics, I believe the film had potential. However, I think too much emphasis was placed on the magnificent set, while the tone, theme, and overall narrative were somewhat neglected.

Re: Loss of Continuity in PX Day Ahead Auction due to ISO Rule Changes 

The emergency tariff filing by the California ISO last Friday has negatively impacted the PX Day Ahead Auction market. The combination of soft and hard caps creates a complete disconnect, posing unacceptable risks to all participants. This change is unlikely to achieve the ISO's desired reduction in real-time energy sales and procurement. Instead, supply will likely continue to favor the higher realized price opportunity offered by the ISO. The PX is petitioning Terry Winter of the ISO to allow for immediate adjustment bids on any submitted schedule at any relevant price."

Absolutely amazing, I have nothing negative to say about this game as it has exceeded my expectations and will likely exceed yours too. The game features fluid movement, is bug and crash-free, and offers a wealth of story content and options for each day, including multiple practices, events, and games. This review is based solely on my experience with MyCareer, and so far, it's a perfect 10/10.

97,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Magic fans beware... Wizards seems hesitant to create a decent digital game. At its core, Magic: The Gathering is a social experience meant to be enjoyed with friends, sharing laughter, playful jabs, and dramatic game-winning moments. Wizards of the Coast appears to have lost sight of this. When playing with friends, you're unable to earn gold, which is crucial. Gold is so vital that a daily cap has been implemented, a reasonable measure considering it unlocks in-game content. However, be prepared for a lengthy and monotonous 1v1 grind against the computer or random opponents, with whom you can't even communicate. If you choose to play for free, it will take approximately 4 hours a day for over a month, solo, to unlock the cards."
98,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Being the 3rd installment in the trilogy, I'll address the drawbacks first. I'm not a fan of prequels, as they technically move the story backward rather than forward, which is an inherent issue with this genre. However, they do offer additional storylines. The combat feels somewhat unrefined and lacks the sharpness that Arkham City achieved. As of this review (26/10/2013), a game-breaking bug prevents the completion of a side mission, although the main storyline remains unaffected. Some gadgets are assigned to inconvenient hotkeys, requiring excessive keyboard navigation, which can disrupt combos during combat."
99,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"They essentially refined Shadow Warrior (2013), particularly the boss fights, which are now awesome. The weapons feel very nice, although not quite as exceptional as those in D44M, but still solid nonetheless. Enemies aren't overly resilient, provided you're not careless with handling elemental and upgrade aspects. The upgrade system is well-balanced, and once you grasp it, it's not too tedious. The elemental mechanics and limited ammo encourage the use of different weapons. There are many cool, unique weapons that remain viable throughout most of the game. The music is great, especially the main theme and, of course, Stan Bush's contributions."
101,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"I think this Assassin's Creed nailed the mechanics on all fronts, including ship battles, sailing, hunting, parkour, and more. I felt a stronger connection to this character as well. Although the story starts off rough, it significantly improves as you progress, a trend I've noticed in every AC game. Edward was an intriguing character, and the side characters were equally captivating. The collectibles in this game felt meaningful, unlike in previous installments, possibly due to their greater purpose in the game. While not required, they were enjoyable to obtain and rewarded in a balanced manner. The character development and storyline progression were well-executed, making the game more engaging."
102,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"While I personally cannot recommend this game, it wasn't absolutely terrible. The gunplay is passable, provided you have the means to purchase gun parts, which is my primary concern: the pay-to-win model. If I could overlook this, the game would be enjoyable, as the hardsuit is fun to use and the HRV concept is excellent. I'd prefer this game over any Call of Duty title, but its pay-to-win microtransaction format is off-putting for me. If you're comfortable with this model, then by all means, have fun. However, if you're like me and dislike pay-to-win games, it's best to let this one pass; it's not our cup of tea."
103,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"While not perfect, this game has been greatly enjoyable. The save system and possibility of sudden death can be frustrating at times. I'm on my first playthrough and lost my main character around hour 10 of 20ish. A reload option at that point would have been appreciated. I've since utilized a 3rd party mod/save tool to mitigate catastrophic failures. The aiming reticule is somewhat small and the zoom feature underpowered. Despite these issues, the game has been a blast. As someone who isn't typically a zombie fan, I've found the combination of strategy, missions, and first-person shooter/beat-em-up elements to be great. I've been playing it as often as possible, always looking to complete just one more mission or supply run before shutting down."
104,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"An absolute great strategy game. Having played every other wargame, including European Escalation and ALB, I must say this one fits well. The numerous units are a great asset. Although I'm unsure of the exact number, there's an impressive array. The graphics are beautiful, the sounds are great, and the overall gameplay is epic. The in-game chat box at the main menu is surprisingly entertaining. However, if you think this game is 'easy' or are new to the strategy genre, be prepared to invest time in mastering it. Don't get discouraged by losses - plan ahead, always have anti-air and anti-tank units at the ready."
105,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"I was initially skeptical about this game, and I wasn't even sure if I wanted to buy it. The concept of the portal gun and portals seemed unusual, despite my fondness for science fiction. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The jokes and voice acting in this game are phenomenal - truly amazing. While it can be cheesy at times, the humor is well-executed. Each story character has their own unique sense of humor, and their distinct personalities shine through. The level design is also impressive. Although I never played the first Portal game, I plan to do so when I have the time. Playing the sequel was what sparked my interest in the series."
107,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Yes, this is a nostalgia trip for thirty-somethings who remember watching the ever-irritating Timmy Mallet in the UK, just for the five-minute Transformers cartoon. The voice actors for Optimus, Megatron, Bumblebee, and many others return, and are instantly recognisable. The distinctive cartoon transformation sound is also present. Graphically, the cell-shaded presentation is perfect and very Generation One. But aside from that, it's actually a very fun game. The combat mechanics are extremely well done, with transforming mid-fight often a necessity, woven seamlessly into combos. This sets it apart from High Moon's excellent War for/Fall of Cybertron games. A notable distinction is the heavy focus on melee combat, although some enemies, such as Seekers, require a switch to a ranged blaster."

110,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"I experienced no performance issues at release, and with the patches, the game runs smoothly. In my opinion, this is a great and enjoyable game, despite the format being somewhat frustrating, where the free-roam city area repopulates with new enemies after each story progression. I particularly enjoyed the 'dual play' segments, where you can play as Batman and another character. The option to use a controller for most segments and switch to mouse and keyboard for tank combat was a welcome feature. Driving the Batmobile around the free-roam city, including chasing APC commanders, is enjoyable once you master the braking system to navigate corners. Mastering this skill makes driving around the city a truly enjoyable experience."
111,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Damn fine aaa fps shooter - that's the bottom line. It's visually stunning, sounds great, and plays exceptionally well - great fps mechanics, a nice story, cool characters, flawless voice acting, and a badass soundtrack. Not for the faint hearted though - some of those cutscenes were pretty darn cruel and vivid. But when a game overall is so great, it's easier to spot the flaws, and here they are as I saw them: - no SLI support, which is surprising. I had to put the game away until I upgraded my card, as it ran poorly on my old dual-GPU GTX 590. Ensure you have a fairly decent single-GPU card. - Some small obstacles are frustratingly unclimbable, which seems illogical."
112,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"English is not my native language, as I am Dutch. Please disregard any typing or grammatical errors in my review of this fantastic game. I will break down this review into several categories: graphics, controls, sound, gameplay, and replayability. 

Graphics: The game features a comic-like style, with very slick graphics that lack unnecessary details. The color schemes are nice, and the overall aesthetic works well for the game. The graphics can be set to 'high' without putting excessive strain on your system. I run the game on an i5 Pentium processor, with an Nvidia GeForce 710m card and 8GB of memory, and it runs smoothly (Windows 8.1).

- controls: The game can be played with a keyboard and mouse, but also with an Xbox controller."
113,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"You can see by the hours I've invested in this game that I thoroughly enjoy it. This is everything I wished a search game from the Call of Duty series would be. However, don't buy this game thinking it's similar to Call of Duty, Battlefield, or any other shooter game. It's a game in its own class and should be treated as such. I've lost count of how many times I hear new players express frustration and complain about getting killed quickly. It's not uncommon to get shot and die, just like in real life. Edit: After playing this game for a while now and investing a significant amount of money, I can say it's one of the best multiplayer games around. It's a great alternative to play when you're not in the mood for CS:GO."
114,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"I'm 2 hours in and thoroughly enjoying this game. The humor is hilarious. Gameplay is solid, art design is beautiful, music is surprisingly high quality and fitting, the story/world has me intrigued, and the puzzles are entertaining. The comedy is the standout feature, with jokes, parodies, and references that will resonate with anyone who's played RPGs since their inception. Even newcomers to the genre will appreciate the humor. If you've played Final Fantasy 7 or X, you owe it to yourself to play this game - the nods to these classics are undeniable. I had to pause after 2 hours to give my cheeks a break from laughing and smiling so much. What a delight so far. The game's lighthearted nature is a breath of fresh air, making it a must-play for fans of the genre."
115,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"I'm really sorry, I try to be supportive of free-to-play games and indie developers, but I didn't enjoy this game. The description seemed appealing, but the execution fell short. As a fan of puzzle and exploration games, I found this game to be completely unintuitive. Despite looking up how to progress, I still didn't find the gameplay enjoyable. The lack of a pause button is a significant oversight, especially with timed sequences. I also feel like the game is heavy on cut scenes, leaving me waiting and unengaged for extended periods. I love puzzle and exploration games, but this one didn't meet my expectations. The description sounded right up my alley, but it didn't translate to a fun experience. Considering the timed sequences, a pause button seems essential. I end up just sitting around drumming my fingers a lot."
116,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"This game is truly breathtaking. From its captivating storyline to its stunning graphics, I was completely enthralled. The narrative wasn't just a generic tale, but rather an immersive experience that made me feel like I was the protagonist, trying to unravel the mysteries of the story. The gameplay was exceptional, and I gained valuable insights about myself, particularly my unexpected fear of heights, which was triggered by the ice caverns. My anxiety was palpable, but I persevered for Uncle Fred's sake. I would be thrilled to see a DLC or sequel, and I would be the first to purchase and recommend it to everyone I know. Thank you to the entire team involved in creating this masterpiece; you've truly crafted a beautiful game."
117,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth is a turn-based game where you build your civilization to achieve a specific goal or 'victory'. Unlike previous games, which followed the Earth's timeline through periods like the Stone Age, Medieval Age, and Modern Age, this game takes place in the future, where you're on a mission to colonize a new planet. I appreciate that 2K took a new approach to the game, introducing mechanics like the affinity system and orbital layer. However, these additions sometimes made the game feel overwhelming. One potential improvement could be incorporating new artwork, such as the environment experienced when communicating with another leader. The game's core remains engaging, but some refinements could enhance the overall experience. The affinity system and orbital layer add depth, but may require time to fully grasp."
118,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Great game with tons of replayability and a very fun zombie survival experience. Definitely in my top 5 zombie games ever played. After 60+ hours of gameplay, I can confidently say this is one of the better, more realistic zombie games. Its design is reminiscent of a survival horror, where you must conserve ammo, heal your wounds, and take medication when infected. The zombies feel natural and are well-animated, especially for a free-to-play game. I highly recommend playing with 1 or 2 friends, but the community is super friendly, making it easy to make friends or chat with others via voice comms."
119,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"02/07/2014 - Unfortunately, I'm unable to wholeheartedly recommend or enjoy this game due to two major issues that detract from the experience. Firstly, the lack of Australian servers results in a severe disadvantage, with even a single red bar causing unbearable lag. Notably, I encountered stuttering and lag during offline training mode, which is perplexing. The poor ping further exacerbates the problem, ultimately ruining the game. Everything is plagued by artifacts - menus, backgrounds, training, and in-game. I've never experienced this issue with my graphics card before, so I suspected it might be related to my overclock. However, resetting my GPU to stock settings made no difference."
120,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"I finished this late last night. Although the story isn't particularly deep or engaging, the storytelling is what sets it apart. The atmosphere is richly detailed, and the numerous collectibles do an excellent job of fleshing it out. I gained valuable insight into the world of Batman, which made the limited number of bosses somewhat disappointing. However, future games can rectify this. The combat strikes a good balance of challenge, albeit on the easier side. Leveling up Batman wasn't very satisfying. The gadgets you upgrade and acquire during the campaign add nice new gameplay mechanics. Getting access to previously unreachable places creates a nice sense of progression."
121,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"'To the Moon' is no mere game... Nay, it is a veritable experience, and it was one of the best of my life at that. Think Telltale's 'The Walking Dead' is sad? Hohoho! Well, it's no match for 'To the Moon'! Never before have I been so emotionally invested, feeling both depressed and fulfilled over something purely fictional. This masterpiece represents the pinnacle of storytelling in my opinion. The soundtrack is a gorgeously charming and perfect accompaniment. Yes, the controls are a bit finicky and the gameplay is not the strong point, but the story is so fantastic that I did not care one bit. The humor of the game is great, complementing the narrative without intruding upon its distinguished nature. The 'Doctor Who' references are endless, adding another layer of depth to the game."
122,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Bastion is a bloody brilliant game, boasting a really great storyline. Set after a calamity has occurred, you begin to rebuild on the bastion. The game offers a considerable amount of choice, allowing you to decide what to build to gain an advantage, which weapons to use, and what power-ups to equip them with, as well as selecting drinks that provide bonus effects. The art style and music are fantastic, with vibrant visuals that defy the typical dullness associated with apocalyptic settings. Notably, the game features dynamic narration that responds to the player's actions. For instance, if you pick up a weapon and then switch to another in the armoury, the narration will acknowledge the change, commenting on your new choice of weapon."
123,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"I initially purchased this game during its early development phase, when the sole currency was spacebux and there was no 'tech tree'. This was when the game truly shone. At that point, all guns were equally overpowered, eliminating any balance issues; players could engage and defeat each other at will. The game also offered unlimited gun slots and five loadouts, allowing for extensive customization. Given the game's claim of having 'bajillions of guns', it's surprising that players are limited to just six weapon slots and three loadouts before having to make a purchase. I once had an impressive collection of guns, spanning three pages, and was brainstorming new ideas, as that's where I found the most enjoyment."
124,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"This game was a surprising gem. One often sees rave reviews of certain products that are often misleading. In this case, the reviews reflect the fun of this neat little game. It is an odd mix between a classic 2D platformer and a MOBA, and it pulls it off with style. I found myself enjoying characters that I wouldn't normally enjoy in other MOBA games. I had expected this trait to continue, but decided to give a melee tank a try anyway. I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome and ended up trying out more as they were unlocked from playing games. The art style and interface are oddly charming. As such, I now use one of the characters as my avatar and a wallpaper from creating a card set for the game."
125,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"I recently started playing, and I'm thoroughly enjoying this game. With my headphones on, I become completely immersed in the game for hours on end. It's been a while since a game has had such a profound effect on me. The music effectively sets the mood, the sound effects are spot on, and the controls are flawless. I eagerly anticipate every combat encounter, and the developers have optimized combat exceptionally well. Initially, I had doubts about the naval combat system, but it's incredibly fun to take down multiple fleets simultaneously. The only way to lose is by failing to retreat. If combat appears overwhelming, simply retreat, regroup, and launch a counter-assault. Thanks, devs, for an awesome experience!"
126,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"The reboot of the Devil May Cry franchise has brought about significant changes for the series, particularly for its protagonist, Dante. While fans of the original series may be upset at the change to their beloved character, it's undoubtedly for the better; and this new game by Ninja Theory proves it. DmC serves as the perfect entry point for newcomers to jump into the series. It showcases the origins of an arrogant, cynical Dante, and chronicles his transformation from cynicism to selflessness. Throughout, the game weaves a clear narrative arc for the new Dante, making him a compelling character to watch. The story follows Dante as he's introduced into the corrupt world he had willfully chosen to ignore, and it chronicles his journey from cynicism to selflessness, making him a more relatable character."
127,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Where do I start with this absolutely beautiful game? Its story is absolutely charming, with meticulous attention to detail, making it a bundle of happiness, bad puns, annoying dogs, and secrets. It strikes a perfect balance between seriousness and humor. The character design is impeccable, featuring diverse characters with unique personalities and secrets. What sets it apart from other RPGs is the absence of violence, a refreshing concept in the genre. Drawing inspiration from Earthbound, one of the best RPGs I've seen, it's clear that this game is something special. The soundtrack is equally impressive, easily the best I've heard in a long time. The game's charm and character design make it stand out, with various characters and secrets to discover."
128,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"I am recommending this solely because it's free, and might be a more enjoyable experience for others. As for my experience, the game did nothing for me. Half the story relies on shock factor, which failed to elicit a reaction from me. I may be desensitized, or perhaps it was too simplistic to warrant an emotional response. The other half of the game attempts to portray a person's mental decline through various themes, including obsession, hallucination, and depression. In theory, it's an intriguing concept. However, the game took me only 10 minutes to complete, even with thoroughly reading and absorbing every detail."
129,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Do I even need to explain why Portal is amazing? Portal is a puzzle game that introduces a concept and then steps aside, allowing you to take the reins. It's an engaging way to challenge your mind while still being entertaining. Although this game isn't as story-driven, it did give birth to one of the most popular games of 2011. I still play this game and beat it when I'm feeling bored, and I love to revisit it to see what sparked a legend and what has become a legend. Gameplay: Portal's gameplay is relatively simple to explain. You utilize portals to your advantage, along with buttons that activate a part of the puzzle. Two types of buttons are in the game: one that you press directly and one that requires a cube to be placed on it."
130,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"If you can overlook the bugs (which I personally experienced only two: one minor and the other quite annoying), I can definitely recommend this space exploration game. Both bugs have since been resolved, with one fix increasing my FPS from 60-90 to 80-120. As most reviews focus on specs, I'll share mine: i5 6600k (~200€), Radeon RX480 (~200€), Z170 Pro Gaming (~150€), and 16GB DDR4 RAM (~70€), totaling ~650€, which falls within the medium price range. Although my rig is relatively new, I consistently achieve 60+ FPS on high settings with VSync enabled, which contradicts the numerous comments claiming overkill setups yet experiencing only 20 FPS."
131,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Remember Age of Mythology? It's been that long since an RTS game of such quality has been released. Divinity: Dragon Commander comes awfully close to becoming my personal favorite RTS game. Combining this with a huge Risk-like grand strategy mode hits the spot. I try not to be overly biased, but the fact that this game allows you to transform into a dragon, supporting, attacking, and commanding unit production, direction, and spawning simultaneously, is a significant draw. I do enjoy complicated RTS games, such as Civilization V. However, such games often attempt to cram complex mechanics, charts, and resources into one complicated game mode, which can be overwhelming. The ability to turn into a dragon and aid troops is a unique feature that sets Divinity apart."
132,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Undertale comes together to create something greater than the sum of its parts. The solid retro graphics and pleasant music combine to form truly beautiful and impactful moments. The script seamlessly transitions from comedic to dramatic to heartbreaking to hopeful, often simultaneously, while cleverly subverting RPG tropes. And all of this without touching on the world, characters, story, gameplay... I could write whole pages about it. But instead, I'll just say this: if you enjoy RPGs, play this game. If you appreciate video games, play this game. If you have seven free hours, play this game."
134,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"I've had this game for just a few months, but in that short time, two DLCs have been released, along with patches that have transformed an already great game into an excellent one. The developers are very active in the community, and their engagement is evident in the discussion forums and dev diaries. Although the game's mechanics have a fairly steep learning curve, which I'm still trying to master, this depth of strategy offers numerous ways to achieve goals and capitalize on situations. The game, in my opinion, is almost infinitely replayable. I find myself fully immersed in every session, regardless of the play-through's progression."

However, after this period, you'll start to notice that the game's offerings are limited to repetitive combat, enemies, and gameplay. A significant high point is the developers' dedication to regular updates, which often include substantial content additions, such as sweeping system changes, new warframes, and various tweaks and features. It's suitable for casual play. Although, I doubt it will maintain your interest beyond a few months unless you enjoy grinding. The game's free-to-play model is a significant advantage. I recommend trying it out, especially if you're looking for a quick gaming fix."
136,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"This game is extremely dull. I purchased it, believing it to be a PC version of 'Katamari Damacy', a popular and enjoyable PS2 game. Unfortunately, it falls short of expectations. The gameplay involves absorbing increasingly larger objects to grow bigger and absorb more. However, the gameplay isn't as smooth as it could be, the levels lack inventiveness, and the overall experience is a surreal and unsettling horror show. I don't mean an entertaining horror show, but rather one that evokes feelings of depression and existential dread. Every 'living' creature in the game, from small pets to human beings, raises questions about the creators' fascination with taxidermy. The game's atmosphere is far from the lighthearted and quirky experience I was expecting."

I thought, 'oh wow, a simulator of the road to becoming president, that sounds fun!' However, it didn't quite live up to my expectations. The game begins by asking you to choose a side: Republican or Democrat, with no option for Independent or third-party affiliation. A little disappointed, but still optimistic, I continued to see what I could do. I will give the game credit, the character customization, although limited, is enjoyable to experiment with. It's the only time you have the option to wear your head or not in a campaign, literally. The game starts you off and says you need to pick a side, there is no other option. I carried on to see what I could do, and I thought the character customization was pretty fun to mess around with."

- 8.6 hours to complete the game 
- 10 collectibles found out of 25 
- zero achievements out of 15 

What I liked: 
- The visuals were impressive up until the last level (ice caves) 
- Although the story was not great, the ending (after the closing credits) somewhat redeemed my time spent playing the game 

What I disliked: 
- The visuals in the last level were uninteresting 
- The gameplay in the last level became significantly harder, making it a frustrating experience of repetition until I got it right 
- Achievements are too hard, with 13 out of 15 achieved by less than 2.1% of players

Cons: -bugs, particularly environmental issues, can cause players to become stuck or encounter invisible walls despite having a clear line of sight to enemies. -The game holds the player's hand, making it feel overly guided. -Enemy AI is underwhelming. -Enemies often seem to have knowledge of the player's location upon being spotted. -Enemies possess unrealistic accuracy, reminiscent of the first Ghost Warrior, which can be frustrating. -Checkpoint and save systems are poorly implemented. -The storyline is unengaging and lacks interest. I wouldn't recommend this game unless it's heavily discounted, even then it feels like a chore to play solely to finish it and move on to the next game in my library. Given the time wasted on the first Ghost Warrior, which was equally uninteresting and felt liberating to finish, I'm unlikely to see this game through to the end."

The learning curve and time required to do anything interesting at the start were too steep for me. Perhaps with more patience and gaming time, this would be compelling.

144,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Hands down, my all-time favorite first-person shooter. However, this game isn't for run-and-gun enthusiasts. Recoil and ballistics are remarkably realistic. A single hit to the chest, neck, or head from a rifle-caliber weapon is often fatal, unless it's just a graze. Rounds drop over distance, and short, controlled bursts are necessary to stay on target. There's no infinite ammunition pool. If you frequently reload mid-magazine, you'll end up with a pouch full of partially used magazines. You can't sprint indefinitely. After a prolonged run, your aim will suffer as you catch your breath. To steady your aim, rest your weapon on your elbows while prone or on a window sill. Accuracy still suffers when standing, but controlled bursts and resting your weapon can help. Rounds drop over distance and single hits can be fatal."

As a result, I never experienced the issues some people claim to have had with the game. I thoroughly enjoyed it, finding it challenging in the early stages but rewarding when executed correctly. As for XCOM2, I'm a big fan - the game runs smoothly on medium settings with my GTX560 and 2GB of VRAM. Initially, the game was set to high, resulting in some sluggish performance, but it wasn't unplayable. Dropping it down to medium resolved the issue. I'm not sure if I'm just fortunate when it comes to avoiding game issues, but many negative reviews seem to stem from an entitled mindset. The game plays well for me, and I've had a positive experience overall."

Although equipment options are limited, there's always another ship to unlock or skill to level up. To extend the game's lifespan, mods are the way to go.

Meanwhile, user equilibrium-seeking AVs and human-driven vehicles are subject to a congestion charge.

However, the effectively linear interaction between motion and light or electricity restricts access to a broader class of quantum states of motion, such as cat states or energy squeezed states.

However, these evaluations can be compromised by fake reviews, or ""spams,"" created by professional spammers who continually adapt and refine their spamming strategies to evade detection. Capturing these strategies is challenging due to their rapid evolution over time, variation across spammers and target products, and often unknown nature. Moreover, existing detectors prioritize detection accuracy, which may not align with the ultimate goal of maintaining trustworthy product evaluations. To address these challenges, we propose a minimax game framework where spammers and spam detectors engage in a competitive dynamic, with objectives that extend beyond mere detection accuracy. The Nash equilibria of this game yield stable detectors that are robust against diverse detection strategies. Spamming strategies are hard to capture, as they can be varying quickly along time, different across spammers and target products, and more critically, remained unknown in most cases. Furthermore, most existing detectors focus on detection accuracy, which is not well-aligned with the goal of maintaining the trustworthiness of product evaluations. To address the challenges, we formulate a minimax game where the spammers and spam detectors compete with each other on their practical goals that are not solely based on detection accuracy. Nash equilibria of the game lead to stable detectors that are agnostic to any mixed detection strategies."

To ensure high fidelity, we employed the Lewis-Riesenfeld method to derive a family of solutions leading to an exact transfer, where the solutions follow a single dynamical mode of the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant. Among this family, we identified a tracking solution with a single parameter to control simultaneously the fidelity of the transfer, the population of the excited state, and robustness. We define a measure of the robustness of an ultra-high fidelity transfer as the minimum percentile deviation on the pulse areas at which the infidelity rises above $10^{-4}$. The robustness of our shaped pulses is found superior to that of Gaussian and adiabatically-optimized pulses for moderate pulse areas, with the Lewis-Riesenfeld method providing a precise control over the transfer process."

We demonstrate that all local minima exhibit a common structural form, partially identifying the component centers of the true mixture. Specifically, each local minimum involves a non-overlapping combination of fitting multiple gaussians to a single true component and fitting a single gaussian to multiple true components. Our findings hold under a certain separation condition for the true mixture components and remain valid regardless of whether the number of components is over- or under-specified. For gaussian mixtures with three components, we derive more precise results concerning the scaling with the separation between the components."

A widely used tool for detecting entanglement is the entanglement witness, where the measurement of the witness operator is guaranteed to be positive for all separable states and can be negative for certain entangled states. In practice, constructing an efficient entanglement witness for general multipartite entangled states is challenging due to the exponentially increasing Hilbert-space dimension with respect to system size. For $n$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-like states, the most robust witness scheme requires $n+1$ local measurement settings and can tolerate up to $1/2$ white noise. In contrast, the most efficient witness for GHZ-like states only needs two local measurement settings and can tolerate up to $1/3$ white noise, making it a more efficient option."

We devise a general method to extract the multipole moments of arbitrary stationary spacetimes and apply it to a large family of horizonless microstate geometries. These geometries can break the axial and equatorial symmetry of the Kerr metric, exhibiting a more complex multipolar structure that offers a means to constrain fuzzball models phenomenologically. Our analysis reveals numerical evidence that all multipole moments are generally larger in absolute value than those of a Kerr black hole with the same mass and spin. Current measurements of the quadrupole moment of black-hole candidates impose only mild constraints on fuzzballs, whereas future gravitational-wave detections of extreme mass-ratio inspirals with the LISA space mission will significantly enhance these bounds."

In practice, long-term edges are often manually specified by humans, which can be costly and suboptimal for downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a model that leverages temporal point processes and variational autoencoders to infer temporal attention between nodes by observing node communication patterns. By driving between-node feature propagation through temporal attention, our approach offers greater flexibility while avoiding the drawbacks associated with human-specified edges, such as high production costs and potential suboptimality."

Consequently, the splittings imply that certain long exact homotopy group sequences decompose into short exact sequences.

The nonparametric formulation, known as modal clustering, establishes a correspondence between groups and the domains of attraction of density modes. To implement this approach, a nonparametric density estimate is required, and proper selection of the amount of smoothing is crucial. This selection governs the shape of the density and, consequently, the modal structure, ultimately identifying the final partition.

However, helicity selection rules for diboson scattering amplitudes pose an obstruction to the naive interference contributions of dimension-six operators, causing the leading contribution to the total diboson rate correction to cancel. Carefully measuring the azimuthal decay angles can ""resurrect"" the interference, recouping sensitivity to the ""non-interfering"" operators. We explore these signatures in detail and find that the EFT uncertainties associated with higher-dimensional operators are uniquely well-suppressed by constructing an asymmetry variable generated solely by these non-interfering operators, relegating the effects of higher-dimensional, interfering operators to the same status as statistical errors in this observable."

Similar to previous frameworks, we categorize the scientific contributions of data science into three task classes: description, prediction, and counterfactual prediction, which encompasses causal inference. A clear classification of data science tasks is essential for discussing the data, assumptions, and analytics required for each task's success.

This note demonstrates that, for a generic Einstein quantum theory of gravity in AdS, exact stability of extremal black branes conflicts with rigorously proven quantum information theorems regarding entanglement entropy. Resolving this contradiction yields a nonperturbative version of the wgc, which aligns with the standard statement at weak coupling.

We demonstrate superfluidity in an ultracold 2d fermi gas by moving a periodic potential through the system and observing no dissipation below a critical velocity v$_{\rm c}$. We measure v$_{\rm c}$ as a function of interaction strength and find a maximum in the crossover regime between bosonic and fermionic superfluidity.

The influence of a chiral chemical potential, namely the electron population imbalance between Weyl nodes of opposite chirality, significantly affects the junction's transport characteristics.

However, a concern for the use of the method is the long-term stability of the implantation-induced conductivity, particularly if the implanted metal species is readily oxidized. Here we report on our examination of the long-term behavior of the surface conductivity of titanium-implanted alumina. The results indicate that after an initial drop of up to 40% in the first few weeks after implantation, the conductivity remains relatively stable, with only a slight decrease of about 10% over the following year, demonstrating its potential for long-term applications."

In this context, vector mesons assume the role of Chern-Simons vector fields residing on the quantum Hall droplet that constitutes the n_f=1 baryon. We propose that this current is the correct effective expression for the baryon current at low energies. This proposal provides a unified picture for the two types of baryons, enabling them to transform into each other naturally. Additionally, Chern-Simons dualities on the droplet can be interpreted as a result of Seiberg-like duality between gluons and vector mesons, allowing for a deeper understanding of the underlying dynamics."

The transverse momentum-dependent skew tunneling of Cooper pairs through the spin-active ferromagnetic insulator interface generates substantial transverse Hall supercurrents, which we term anomalous Josephson Hall effect currents. By extending the Furusaki-Tsukada formula, initially developed to quantify conventional Josephson current flows, we assess the transverse current components and show that their amplitudes can be broadly tuned via the spin-orbit coupling strengths or the superconducting phase difference across the junction. Notably, well-localized subgap bound states form around the interface, serving as a distinct spectroscopic signature of Josephson junctions."

Vortices separate into two distinct families: small, fast-moving cores and larger, slowly moving ones that can be described as 'frozen' into a slowly evolving 'crystal'. The kinematics of both families differ significantly, with only the former exhibiting self-similarity. The latter family is responsible for most of the flow's kinetic energy, forming the dipoles and streams."

The running time of quantum algorithms in this framework is often characterized by the quantum hitting time, which is the time required for the quantum walk to find a vertex of interest with a high probability. This article provides improved upper bounds for the quantum hitting time, applicable to several ctqw-based quantum algorithms. Notably, our techniques are applied to the glued-trees problem, yielding a polynomial factor improvement in the hitting time upper bound, from $o(n^5)$ to $o(n^2\log n)$. Our methods also help to exponentially improve the dependence on precision of the continuous-time quantum walk-based algorithm for finding a marked node on any ergodic, reversible Markov chain by Chakraborty et al."
226,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,paper_abstract,"Extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) can be categorized into dry EMRIs and wet EMRIs based on their distinct formation mechanisms. Dry EMRIs, previously considered the primary EMRI sources for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, are primarily generated through multi-body scattering in the nuclear star cluster and gravitational capture. This letter highlights an alternative EMRI formation channel: wet EMRI formation facilitated by the accretion flow surrounding accreting galactic-center massive black holes (MBHs). In this channel, the accretion disk captures stellar-mass black holes initially moving on inclined orbits, and subsequently drives them to migrate towards the MBH, significantly boosting the formation rate of EMRIs in such galaxies by orders of magnitude."

Despite this, we expect our recommender systems to engage users from the start, encouraging them to stay on the website and become active users. This challenge falls under the new user cold-start category, which is vital to a company's development and survival. Existing research on user cold-start recommendation often requires additional user effort, such as setting up an interview process, or utilizes side information like user demographics, locations, and social relations. However, users may be unwilling to participate in interviews, and side information on cold-start users is usually not available. Existing works on user cold-start recommendation either require additional user efforts, e.g. Setting up an interview process, or make use of side information [10] such as user demographics, locations, social relations, etc."
228,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,paper_abstract,"Deep learning has resolved numerous problems that were previously inaccessible to heuristic algorithms. Its successful application in wireless communications is notable, despite the existence of well-understood radio systems and optimal algorithms for various tasks. Although learning individual receiver components has yielded some benefits, a more effective approach involves jointly learning the entire receiver. However, this often leads to a complex nonlinear problem, for which the optimal solution is impractical to implement. To address this, we introduce a deep fully convolutional neural network, deeprx, which processes the entire receiver pipeline from frequency domain signal streams to uncoded bits in a 5G-compliant manner. By carefully constructing the input of the convolutional neural network using both data and pilot symbols, we enable accurate channel estimation."
229,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,paper_abstract,"Mutation-based fuzzing typically uses an initial set of non-crashing seed inputs (a corpus) from which to generate new inputs by mutation. A corpus of potential seeds often contains thousands of similar inputs, resulting in a lack of diversity that can lead to wasted fuzzing effort through exhaustive mutation from all available seeds. To address this, distillation tools (e.g., afl-cmin) are used to select the smallest subset of seeds that triggers the same range of instrumentation data points as the full corpus. Minimizing the number and cumulative size of seeds is believed to lead to more efficient fuzzing. We present results of 34+ cpu-years of fuzzing with five distillation approaches to understand their impact on finding bugs in real-world software, exploring this concept systematically."

A scalable supervisor is designed, with state size and computational cost independent of the number of agents, for the case of partial observation. Notably, this supervisor does not require recomputation when agents are added or removed. We extend our previous results to partial observation by proposing sufficient conditions for safety and maximal permissiveness of the scalable least restrictive supervisor at the template level. An example is provided to illustrate the proposed scalable supervisory synthesis, demonstrating its effectiveness in multi-agent systems."

An efficient approach for ENF estimation is introduced, utilizing temporal windowing based on the filter-bank Capon spectral estimator. The method leverages a type of Gohberg-Semencul factorization of the model covariance matrix, exploiting its Toeplitz structure. Notably, this approach pioneers the use of a non-rectangular temporal window prior to spectral estimation in the field of ENF. Krylov matrices facilitate fast implementation of matrix inversions. The proposed approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods in ENF estimation when employing a short 1-second time window in power recordings. In speech recordings, the approach yields highly accurate results, balancing time complexity and accuracy."

As a corollary, regularized regression estimators based on these reduced dimension spaces are provided, including classical principal component regression and sparse partial robust M regression. The package also contains classical and robust pre-processing utilities, such as generalized spatial signs, dedicated plotting functionality, and cross-validation utilities. The direpack package is written consistent with the scikit-learn API, allowing estimators to seamlessly integrate into statistical and machine learning pipelines in that framework."
233,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,paper_abstract,"The nonlinear fluorescence emission has been widely applied for high spatial resolution optical imaging. Here, we studied the fluorescence anomalous saturating effect of the nitrogen vacancy defect in diamond. The fluorescence reduction was observed with high power laser excitation, increasing the nonlinearity of the fluorescence emission and altering the spatial frequency distribution of the fluorescence image. We employed a differential excitation protocol to extract high spatial frequency information. By modulating the excitation laser's power, the spatial resolution of imaging was improved approximately 1.6 times compared to confocal microscopy. Due to the simplicity of the experimental setup and data processing, we expect this method can be used for improving the spatial resolution of sensing and biological labeling with defects in solids, offering a promising approach for future applications."
234,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,paper_abstract,"When random effects are correlated with sample design variables, the conventional approach of using individual survey weights to form a pseudo-likelihood no longer yields asymptotically unbiased inference. We develop a weight-exponentiated formulation for the random effects distribution, enabling unbiased inference for generating hyperparameters. This approach is compared to frequentist methods that rely on numerical integration, revealing that only the Bayesian method achieves unbiased estimation with respect to the sampling design distribution and consistency with respect to the population generating distribution. Our simulations and a real data example from a survey of business establishments demonstrate the utility of our approach across various modeling formulations and sampling designs. This work serves as a culmination of recent efforts combining traditional survey estimation approaches with the Bayesian modeling paradigm, bridging the gap between these two rich but disparate sub-fields."

Their reduced symmetries lead to inhomogeneous electron, optical, valley, and spin responses, as well as novel properties like ferroelasticity, ferroelectricity, magnetism, spin-wave phenomena, and large nonlinear optical properties. Additionally, low symmetry enables novel electronic topological properties, nonlinear elastic properties, and structural phase transformations.

Notably, it was discovered that the relaxation of electric birefringence in a mesogenic polymer melt above the nematic-isotropic phase transition temperature can be described by a sum of several exponential processes, with two dominant processes playing a crucial role. These primary processes replace each other within a temperature range of approximately fifty degrees. Dielectric spectroscopy also revealed two distinct orientational relaxation processes: one attributed to the rotation of side mesogenic groups, and the other associated with the motion of main chain segments, providing a more detailed understanding of the polymer's behavior."

Optimizing discrete hash bits remains a key focus in these methods. A common approach involves adopting an activation function, such as $\operatorname{sigmoid}(\cdot)$ or $\operatorname{tanh}(\cdot)$, and minimizing a quantization loss to approximate discrete values. However, this paradigm can cause hash bits to become stuck in the wrong saturated area of the activation functions, never escaping. We refer to this issue as the ""dead bits problem"" (dbp). The existing quantization loss can exacerbate dbp. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective gradient amplifier that precedes activation functions to mitigate dbp."

We consider two scenarios: stable triplets contributing to dark matter density, or unstable triplets decaying via mixing with the standard model Higgs boson. The former is constrained by LHC disappearing charged track searches and dark matter direct detection experiments. The latter is constrained by existing multilepton collider searches. Our findings indicate that a two-step electroweak phase transition involving a stable triplet with a negative quadratic term is ruled out by direct detection searches. Conversely, an unstable triplet with a mass below 230 GeV is excluded at a 95% confidence level."

The standard scenario assumes an initially circular and narrow belt of planetesimals at semi-major axis $a$, whose eccentricity is increased to $e_f$ after the gas disc has dispersed due to secular perturbations from an eccentric planet, resulting in a belt of width $2ae_f$. A minor modification to this scenario suggests that narrower belts can form if the planetesimals are initially eccentric, potentially resulting from earlier planet perturbations during the gas-rich protoplanetary disc phase. However, a primordial eccentricity could also be caused by instabilities that increase the disc eccentricity, without the need for any planets."

In one dimension (1D), the physics of interacting electrons is well-captured at low energies by the Tomonaga-Luttinger-Liquid (TLL) model, yet little has been observed experimentally beyond this linear regime. Here, we report on measurements of many-body modes in 1D gated-wires using a tunnelling spectroscopy technique. We observe two distinct Fermi seas at high energies, associated with spin and charge excitations, along with the emergence of three additional 1D 'replica' modes that intensify with decreasing wire length. The effective interaction strength in the wires is varied by changing the amount of 1D inter-subband screening, which is adjusted by over 45%."

To constrain this path, we investigate the link between globular clusters and known merging events experienced by the Milky Way. We combined Gaia's kinematic information for nearly all galactic clusters with the largest sample of cluster ages, carefully correcting for systematic errors. To identify clusters with a common origin, we analyzed their dynamical properties, particularly in the space of integrals of motion. Our results show that about 40% of the clusters likely formed in situ, shedding light on the complex formation history of the Milky Way's globular cluster system."

To facilitate easy access to these novel estimators, the package provides high-level, intuitive functions built on a set of efficient, low-level routines. Intrinsic encompasses models in two categories: homogeneous and heterogeneous intrinsic dimension estimators. The homogeneous category comprises the two-nn and gride models, with functions that perform inference under both frequentist and Bayesian frameworks. The heterogeneous category includes hidalgo, a Bayesian mixture model, for which an efficient Gibbs sampler is implemented. The package's design allows for seamless integration of these models into various workflows."

Our micromagnetic simulation results on the nonlinear responses of MSM and STNO to current pulse stimulation showed that an RC system using a single MSM achieved outstanding performance in handwritten digits recognition. Furthermore, complex unknown nonlinear dynamic problems were effectively solved by a physical RC system consisting of 24 STNOs, as confirmed in a second-order nonlinear dynamic system and NARMA10 tasks."

This paper identifies a surprising consequence of popularity-based rankings: when fewer items report a given signal, they collectively attract a higher share of overall traffic. The few-get-richer effect emerges in settings with few distinct item classes, such as left-leaning versus right-leaning news sources, where items are ranked by popularity. Analytically, we demonstrate that this effect occurs when people click on top-ranked items and have diverse preferences for item classes. We analyze the effect's strength through simulations, considering various setting and human behavior assumptions. Our predictions are experimentally tested in an online study with human participants. The findings have significant implications for understanding the spread of misinformation, particularly in settings with few distinct item classes and popularity-based rankings."

To address this issue, we introduce a novel sparsity dimension, pattern-based sparsity, which combines pattern and connectivity sparsity to achieve both high accuracy and hardware friendliness. By carefully designing patterns, our proposed pruning method consistently achieves accuracy enhancement and improved feature extraction capabilities across different DNN structures and datasets. Our pattern-aware pruning framework simultaneously performs pattern library extraction, pattern selection, pattern and connectivity pruning, and weight training. The new pattern-based sparsity approach seamlessly integrates with compiler optimization, enabling highly efficient DNN execution on mobile platforms."

We examine the impact of mountaintop removal mining (mrm) on mortality using a difference-in-differences analysis that leverages the increase in mrm following the 1990 clean air act amendments. For a difference-in-differences analysis of the effect of mrm on mortality, we constructed a more closely matched control group and found a 95% confidence interval that encompasses substantial adverse effects, no effect, and small beneficial effects."

I also enjoy concerti and symphonies. As a voracious reader, my tastes span from Ian McEwan to Stephanie Meyer, including the Twilight tetralogy. At home, I indulge in my home theater, devouring DVDs, video on demand, and a lot of television. My favorite shows include ""Law & Order: SVU,"" Tina Fey's ""30 Rock,"" and ""Judge Judy,"" where the people, cases, and rulings are all real."
271,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"[Citizens of the world, we face a global crisis of unprecedented scale. Please stand by for a message from the Secretary-General of the United Nations, António Guterres.] The climate emergency is the defining crisis of our time. We are in a race against time, and we are losing. A growing tide of impatience, especially among young people, is rising due to global inaction. We need increased ambition from all stakeholders: governments, cities, businesses, investors, and people everywhere. I'm pleased you're launching TED Countdown. Your influence and ideas can help accelerate momentum for a carbon-neutral world by 2050, the only way to avert the worst impacts of global heating. We possess the necessary tools, science, and resources. Let us now engage in this race with the required political will and energy."
272,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"Menstruation, a simple term describing a natural biological process, has been burdened by centuries of stigma, forcing many to discuss it in hushed tones. But why? As I speak, over 800 million women worldwide are experiencing their period. None of us would exist without it, yet it remains a subject often deemed 'embarrassing.' From my experience and that of the women around me, I can attest that it's exhausting. It's exhausting to discreetly take out a pad from a brown paper bag, hastily stuffing it into your pocket during class, and rushing to the washroom as unobtrusively as possible. The struggle to sit through lessons and meetings, pretending to be normal while internally coping with intense period cramps, is a familiar and draining experience."
273,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"The world's largest and most devastating environmental and industrial project is situated in the heart of Canada's boreal forest, the largest and most intact forest globally. Spanning across northern Canada, including Labrador, it is home to the George River caribou herd, the largest remaining wild caribou herd in the world, with approximately 400,000 animals. Although I was unable to find one during my visit, the antlers serve as proof. The boreal region is blessed with an incredible abundance of wetlands, which are globally one of the most endangered ecosystems. These ecosystems are critical, as they clean the air and water, sequester large amounts of greenhouse gases, and support a huge diversity of species. They are a vital component of our planet's ecological balance."
274,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"Before the world of humans began, there existed a realm of the gods, comprising lush fields, expansive plains, and vibrant gardens. Four brothers wandered this celestial expanse, bound together by their fraternal bond, as they had no family other than each other – their parents' identities remained a mystery. One of the brothers, Deminan, stood out from the others due to his distinct appearance. His skin was marred by painful scabs, leaving him to ponder why he alone bore this affliction. One day, while the supreme spirit Yaya tended to his gardens, Deminan and his brothers snuck into Yaya's house. After feasting and exploring, they spotted a giant gourd hanging in the corner. However, as they attempted to peer inside the gourd, it slipped from their grasp and fell."
275,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"I had graduated seven years ago from Berkeley with a dual degree in molecular and cell biology and linguistics. Following graduation, I attended a career fair on campus, where I secured an interview with a start-up called Theranos. At the time, there was limited information available about the company, but what I found was impressive. Essentially, Theranos was developing a medical device that could run a comprehensive blood panel from a finger-stick of blood. This innovation had the potential to make blood tests less painful, as it would eliminate the need for a large needle injection in the arm. This concept was intriguing not only due to its reduced invasiveness but also its potential to open the door to predictive diagnostics."
276,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"My journey to become a polar specialist, photographing and specializing in the polar regions, began when I was four years old, when my family relocated from southern Canada to northern Baffin Island, near Greenland. There, we lived among the Inuit in a small community of 200 Inuit people, where we were one of three non-Inuit families. In this community, we lacked modern amenities - no television, computers, or radio, and not even a telephone. As a result, I spent all my time outdoors with the Inuit, playing and learning. The snow and ice served as my playground, and the Inuit were my guides. This is where my fascination with the polar realm truly began."
277,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"We're perceived as the organization that serves as a last resort for failed social policies. I have no control over who comes to us or the duration of their stay. We receive individuals for whom all other avenues have been exhausted, those who have slipped through the cracks of existing social safety nets. Since they can't be contained elsewhere, we must take them in. Our role is to contain and control them. Over the years, as a prison system, a nation, and a society, we've become adept at this task, but that's not something to be proud of. Today, we have the highest incarceration rate per capita globally. Notably, there are more black men incarcerated today than were enslaved in 1850."
278,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"I'd like to take you on the epic quest of the Rosetta spacecraft. Escorting and landing the probe on a comet has been my passion for the past two years. To understand this journey, let's delve into the origin of the solar system. Approximately four and a half billion years ago, a cloud of gas and dust existed. At its center, our sun formed and ignited, giving rise to the planets, comets, and asteroids we know today. According to theory, after the Earth cooled down following its formation, comets collided with it, delivering water and possibly complex organic material. This may have played a crucial role in bootstrapping the emergence of life. The rest of the story remains the same, as the original text had 139 words and only 69 words were edited."
279,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"Chris Anderson: Hello, TED community, welcome back for another live conversation. Today's discussion is particularly significant. When we launched the 'Build Back Better' series, our goal was to explore ways to address the challenges posed by the pandemic and envision a path forward. However, the tragic events of the past week, including the devastating death of George Floyd and the subsequent daily protests, have introduced a new sense of urgency that we must acknowledge. Can we build back better from this? I believe that before we can even begin to answer that question, we must first strive to comprehend the magnitude of this moment. Whitney Pennington Rodgers: That's right, Chris."
280,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"In 1903, the President of the United States embarked on a three-day camping trip in California's Yosemite Valley. President Theodore Roosevelt slept beneath a grove of towering sequoia trees, braved a snowstorm, and spent hours conversing around the campfire with his host and guide, renowned conservationist John Muir. Roosevelt was famously enamored with the outdoors, but Muir had invited him for a more pressing purpose: Yosemite was in peril. Although Yosemite had been designated as protected land in 1864, the valley remained vulnerable to overdevelopment in 1903. This was at the heart of a decades-long struggle to balance preservation and public use – two objectives that proved far more challenging to achieve than they were to articulate. The battle over Yosemite's fate began with the 1849 gold rush, when a surge of miners flocked west in search of gold in the Sierra Nevada foothills."

(applause) My lifelong ambition has been to become a pilot, to soar through the skies and experience the thrill of freedom. However, that dream remains elusive. Living in Gaza, I'm surrounded by closed borders and the absence of an airport. We're essentially confined to one of the world's largest prisons. My only solace is gazing up at the sky. On some days, we're fortunate to have electricity for four or five hours. When it's cold, we resort to making fires on our rooftops or in front of our homes."
282,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"I apologize, but I must conceal my face to protect myself from those who would harm me. My journey began 14 years ago as a young reporter, fresh out of college. I stumbled upon a scoop that, although straightforward, had significant implications. It involved police officers accepting bribes from street vendors. Determined to make a lasting impact, I decided to approach the story differently, as the issue was well-known but largely ignored. I chose to go undercover, posing as a vendor to gather concrete evidence. The impact was substantial, and this style of reporting is often referred to as immersion or undercover journalism. I had just come out of college and was eager to make a name for myself. The scoop was quite simple, yet it had the potential to spark change. As a young reporter, I thought that I should do it in a different way, so that it has a maximum impact, since everybody knew that it was happening, and yet there was nothing that was keeping it out of the system. The impact was great. It was fantastic."
283,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"One simple vitamin can reduce your risk of heart disease. Eating chocolate reduces stress in students. A new drug prolongs lives of patients with rare diseases. Health headlines like these are published daily, sometimes making opposing claims. There can be a disconnect between broad, attention-grabbing headlines and the often specific, incremental results of the medical research they cover. To avoid being misled by sensational headlines, it's essential to assess their credibility. The best way to do this is to examine the original research they report on. We've created hypothetical research scenarios for each of these three headlines. Keep watching for the explanation of the first example; then pause at the headline to answer the question. These scenarios are simplified for clarity."
284,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"When I was 14, my family was in the process of adopting my little brothers from Ethiopia. One day, my mom asked, ""What day should we put for their birthday?"" I thought it was a ridiculous question, responding, ""The day they were born, obviously?"" However, my mom explained that neither of my brothers had a birth certificate, making it impossible to determine their exact birthdate. This revelation left me stunned. Now, 20 years later, I'm still working on this issue, but instead of solving the mystery of my brothers' missing birth certificates, I'm trying to address this problem globally. So, what do birth certificates have to do with international development?"
285,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"Imagine being able to plug your brain into a machine that would bring you ultimate pleasure for the rest of your life. If given the choice to sign up for such an existence, would you take it? This is the question philosopher Robert Nozick posed through a thought experiment known as the Experience Machine. The experiment invites us to consider a world where scientists have developed a machine that simulates real life, guaranteeing experiences of only pleasure and never pain. The catch is that you must permanently leave reality behind, but the difference would be barely noticeable. Your experiences would be indistinguishable from reality, with life's natural ups and downs replaced by an endless series of highs. Sounds great, right?"
286,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"I'd like to share with you the most embarrassing experience I've had during my years as a palliative care physician. This incident occurred a couple of years ago. I was consulted to see a woman in her 70s, a retired English professor, who was battling pancreatic cancer. She was experiencing pain, nausea, and vomiting, prompting the request for my expertise. During our consultation, we discussed her symptoms, and she inquired about the potential benefits of medical marijuana. I reflected on my medical school education, only to realize that I had received no formal training on the subject, leaving me with a significant knowledge gap."

I am a woman leading a department in a male-dominated profession. Ten years ago, I decided to expand my medical knowledge and pursued a nursing degree. This decision was driven by the realization that the next significant threat facing not only my city, but also other cities nationwide, was not the one-and-done disaster, where you can ride in like the cavalry, as a firefighter, put out the fire and leave, feeling like you have made a difference and everything is ok."
288,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"Where does all the released carbon go? Carbon operates within a natural cycle, present in all living things: in the soil, oceans, atmosphere, and deep underground rocks. When plants and other living organisms die, much of their stored carbon returns to the atmosphere until new plants grow and reabsorb it. Over millions of years, some carbon from ancient trees and sea life transforms into rock and fossil fuels: coal, oil, and natural gas. Natural events, such as volcanic eruptions, release some of the carbon trapped in rock. Human activities, like burning fossil fuels, also release prehistoric carbon. Today, humans release around 60 times more carbon than all the volcanoes on the planet each year, while the natural cycle continues with plants and other living things dying and new ones growing."
289,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"Even nature's most unappealing creatures hold significant secrets, but who would want a swarm of cockroaches approaching them? Yet, one of the greatest differences between natural and human technologies lies in robustness. Robust systems remain stable in complex and unfamiliar environments. Notably, cockroaches can self-stabilize while running over rough terrain. When we equipped them with a jet pack or subjected them to a perturbation like an earthquake, we found that their remarkably tuned legs allowed them to self-stabilize without utilizing any brainpower. They can navigate complex terrain, such as grass, with ease and remain stable. We discovered a new behavior where, due to their shape, they automatically roll onto their side to pass through a test section of artificial grass. Robust systems can perform multiple tasks with the same structure. Here's a new behavior we've discovered."

To lift your spirits, I'd like to share a remarkable, albeit lesser-known, commercial success story from the past 20 years. Comparable, in its own unique way, to the achievements of Microsoft or Google, this industry has defied the current recession with remarkable resilience. I'm referring to organized crime. While it's true that organized crime has a long history, its expansion over the last two decades has been unprecedented, now accounting for roughly 15 percent of the world's GDP. I call it the global shadow economy, or Mcmafia for short. Organized crime has been around for a very long time, but what triggered this extraordinary growth in cross-border crime?"
291,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"If you ask people about the most challenging aspect of psychology, and you mention thinking and emotions, most people will say that emotions are incredibly complex and difficult to understand. They often express uncertainty about how emotions work. In contrast, thinking is perceived as relatively straightforward, involving logical reasoning. However, this perspective overlooks the complexity of thinking. Here's a list of problems that arise. One notable issue is addressing health concerns. I recently read an article stating that handshaking in Western cultures is likely the single largest cause of disease."
292,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"What is a parent? It's not an easy question. Today, we have adoption, stepfamilies, and surrogate mothers, making the concept of parenthood increasingly complex. Many parents face tough questions and tough decisions. Should we tell our child about the sperm donation, and if so, when and how? Sperm donors are often referred to as ""biological fathers,"" but is it accurate to use the word ""father""? As a philosopher and social scientist, I've studied these questions about parenthood. However, today I'll share what I've learned from speaking with parents and children. They've shown me that despite their unconventional family structures, they know what truly matters in a family."

(cheering) I see all of that and a man who spent a quarter of his life in state prison — six years, to be exact, starting as a teenager on Rikers Island for an act that nearly cost a man his life. However, it wasn't the punishment I faced as a teenager in adult prison or the harshness of our legal system that transformed me. Instead, it was a classroom learning environment that introduced me to possibilities I never thought existed for me or our justice system as a whole. A few weeks before my release on parole, a counselor encouraged me to enroll in a new college course being offered in the prison."

Or just an airport security line delay. That one's actually true. (laughter) If some of your perceptions were negative, I don't really blame you. The media often portrays people who look like me in a negative light. One study found that 80 percent of news coverage about Islam and Muslims is negative.

The first time I spoke at a conference was here at TED, eight years ago. Fresh out of grad school, I had no idea that in those few minutes onstage, I was framing the questions that would define my work for the next decade. And, like many 20-somethings, I expected to solve the world's problems — more specifically, the world's water problems — with my technology. I had a lot to learn. It was seductive to believe that our biggest water quality problems persist because they're so hard to identify. I presumed that we just needed simpler, faster, and more affordable sensors. I was wrong."

I had a deep understanding of the global economy, as it was my life's work. I was familiar with various topics, including ecology and the potential end of the world, but I didn't truly believe in their significance. In 2007, the subprime crisis and the collapse of major American banks occurred, which was a shocking event. I recall having intense discussions with my wife about the matter, my job, and the limitations of our financial models. The crisis made me realize that I had been mistaken, and we were actually heading towards disaster."

This is one of those magical abilities that enable us to convey complex thoughts to one another.

These vibrations travel to you, hitting your eardrums, and then your brain transforms them into thoughts. I hope that's happening. (laughter) So, thanks to this ability, we humans can share our ideas across vast distances and time, transmitting knowledge from one mind to another. We can transmit really complicated thoughts to one another. I'm making sounds with my mouth as I'm exhaling. Those air vibrations are traveling to you, they're hitting your eardrums, and then your brain takes those vibrations from your eardrums and transforms them into thoughts.
