1,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Another week just flew by me. I drove by the new house yesterday and the front window was covered in boxes. We may receive the keys at closing, I am getting so excited. If all goes well this week, we will be set for closing a week from Wednesday. I was up until after 3:00am last night watching movies with Bethany. There has been a lot of movie watching going on around here lately. Here's my rundown; last night we watched Thirteen, a movie every mother of a teen should see. It was better than I expected. Then we watched Gigli, yeah it was just as bad as the media said it was, but we had to see for ourselves."
2,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Summer TV used to be a dead zone full of repeats. But now there are two great new shows on TV, and I've been watching both religiously for the last week. Blow Out has the gayest concept ever, yet seemingly has zero gay people in sight. Hairstylist Jonathan Antin wants to build a second location for his incredibly popular West Hollywood salon, this time in Beverly Hills. Normally, no one would care, certainly not I, but as I was flipping through the channels, I caught a glimpse of Jonathan, equally narcissistic and dull, looking at an empty space on Rodeo Drive and saying, in a public voice, 'I'm going to build here the greatest salon in the history of the world ever!' and I was hooked. Not since Rocco have I found such a moron compelling TV watching."
3,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"What a week ... My right shoulder has tendinitis. It's located right under my shoulder blade. So, when I move my arm excessively, mainly while using a mouse on a computer, it's excruciating. I can barely move it now because I was on a spree updating my website and working on other online tasks. I can barely muster the strength to draw anything. Lack of sleep exacerbates my pain. I'm not too happy right now, but I'll recover. My mom's surgery went okay. Her eyesight has partially returned. She can see fuzzy shapes and distinguish colors. Other than that, she's still severely impaired. Hopefully, she'll fully regain her vision soon."
4,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Kindness of strangers... Attempted laundry today with the kids in tow and realized how quickly the simplest tasks can become a chaotic ordeal. I also learned how remarkably kind total strangers can be for no reason other than because they feel like being generous. Trust me. It wasn't like they were trying to impress me or anything. I had kid drool all over me and was wearing my casual 'wash-day' outfit... Also, I'm not super sure I'll ever be bathing again, so it's not like there was even an olfactory incentive there. I am doing two things simultaneously. I am composing a post and I am also watching the collected No Doubt music videos. I am doing both of these things while sitting at my desk in my room."
5,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"It's 11:14pm MST, and I'm sitting in my bedroom, fixing the personal computer of our personnel director from work. Not that I mind doing it, but I sometimes wonder how often I find myself fixing someone else's computer as a favour. I'm glad to be able to show love and care for people this way, but where is the line drawn before it becomes taking advantage? The last couple of weeks, I've been staying up late reading and such, so I was looking forward to an early night, until I realized it would be more prudent to return this computer to its owner. *laugh* No rest for the weary, right? So, I ended up watching Joe Schmo 2 again tonight."
6,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Remind me, what did I write about before this? Or, a continuation in the 'is this a date?' saga. So, after the weird lunch, my confidence was shaken. I forgot to tell you guys an important piece of the story. Before Pat shows up to lunch, Dustin starts talking about what a nice guy Pat is and how he's trying to find a girlfriend for him. I'm listening and nodding, realizing that we're talking more about finding Dustin's best friend a girl than discussing whatever it is you discuss with a stranger over pink lemonade. I excused myself to the bathroom, looked in the mirror, and then silently asked myself: am I being pawned off to the other guy? Is this what happens now?"
7,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"I would like everyone to think before they act. I'd like each person in the world to think before they get out of bed in the morning, and make a commitment to keep thinking all day. If they're not prepared to, I'd like them to reconsider and reflect on their actions. I'm tired of people acting impulsively. I'm not the smartest person in the world, but I'm not talking about complex issues. I think it's fair to criticize those who act without thinking. Let's focus on a few examples for now and save the rest for another day, sound good? Great."
8,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Two problems with the scenario outlined in my previous post: 1. True, Bush is stimulating the economy, but in the wrong way. Robert Rubin told NPR's Marketplace today that Bush could have achieved the same stimulus effect without the long-term debt burden by enacting different tax cuts, temporary tax cuts that would benefit low- and middle-income individuals. Ah, Robert Rubin - the sound of his name is music to our ears. Quick: name one Bush administration cabinet official on the domestic side with Rubin's stature. Still thinking? It'll come to you... 2. We can't give the Republicans control only in wartime because they've ingeniously concocted an endless, global 'war on terrorism.'"
9,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"'She's saying I'm on the run, I'm chasing guys for fun' ~The Offspring. I haven't updated in a while, but there's not much to share. Went to The Cove to see Supernova, they were good as usual, and got to hang out with Tiago. On Saturday, I went to work and then out with Joe and Rach, met up with Steve, Tiago, and Tom. Came home at quarter to 12 and woke up the next morning at quarter to 7 for a meet. Got there a little late, but it's all good - I completed my full floor routine without falling, placed second on floor and vault, and third on beam, scoring 29.45 all-around, which isn't bad since my meets tend to improve as the season progresses."
10,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Do you ever have one of those moments when you begin to reflect on life? Like you're sitting in math class, feeling utterly bored, and you wonder what exactly goes on in your brain that makes you understand math? And you realize that you exist and you are in math class, and you wonder why. Then you realize how amazing existing is. And suddenly it hits you - the fact that you are going off on this random train of thought is incredibly pathetic. Ever had that happen? I dislike that feeling. You know what else I dislike? Block schedules. Who would ever come up with that idea? Anyone can see that sitting through a two-and-a-half-hour class in any subject is cruel and unusual punishment."
11,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"I think that Monopoly has run its course in my life, and I vow to never lay my hands on that iron piece again. Tonight, Andy beat me by a few small dollars and won the game, or maybe I let him win since he's leaving in a few short hours and I wanted him to feel good on his last night here. However the story goes, it can't compare to this Texas-sized headache I have at the moment. I've taken some Aleve, and I must say that they're doing the trick; all I need now is some well-deserved rest and relaxation. Your telephone's the one that helped me wrap the cord around your neck... At the Drive-In."
12,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Today's been a long day. We drove home from Indiana. I'll have to be selective about what I write, as I could easily take up a lot of time and space, but I'm low on energy. First off, I have to say that camp was amazing and exceeded my expectations. God has been doing incredible things in my life lately, and it's truly awesome. I've made a positive change, but anyway, back to the beginning. We arrived at the Twiggs' house on Friday evening and stayed until we left for camp on Monday. Most of our activities included visiting the fair, attending church, watching a parade, going to Walmart, and watching movies."
13,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Today is my last day of summer vacation! I'm filled with dread, and I have a dentist appointment at 9. I dislike it, but I'd rather get it over with than try to schedule it during the first month of my surgery rotation. I'm definitely nervous, scared, jittery, and anxious about returning to school. This is going to be a whole new challenge for me. As a perfectionist, I love excelling at everything I do. However, starting new things is daunting. I hate being uncertain (like I told Cassie: 'I'm going to be the only pawn on the chessboard who insists on moving like a knight'), and I hate not knowing what's going on."
14,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Arun Shourie discusses how the present Governor of Uttar Pradesh had warned, as far back as 1996, about the impending threat of the rise of a 'third Islamic state' in the subcontinent. T V Rajeswar, the former head of the Intelligence Bureau and the present Governor of Uttar Pradesh, had predicted this dire threat in a series of articles published in the Hindustan Times, way back in 1996. Shourie raises a valid point when he says, does the fact that you now know that he, and not I, to say nothing of Mr. Advani, penned all that make the warnings ring true? Or do you conclude that because he wrote in this vein, T V Rajeswar is a closet communalist and should not be allowed to continue as Governor of Uttar Pradesh?"
15,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Attitude: bored, mood: indifferent, looking forward to tonight. It's been a long, hard day in the trenches here today, folks, with almost no time to write for you readers. However, it's great to see Tigger (now Akcron) taking up the reins and making an appearance, discussing various topics. Not much to say, but yesterday's Shakespeare on the Green was a lovely play, although I had to leave before the closing curtain, which was disappointing. Hopefully, someday I'll see a Shakespeare play in its entirety. But I digress. Akcron is right about the shower issues; it's subpar. In terms of laughing at her in the shower, you have to admit, the look people get when enduring self-inflicted discomfort can be quite amusing."
16,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"All of a sudden, for the past two days, I have been overcome with terrible bouts of exhaustion. Utterly drained. Last evening, I went home and just slept off, only getting up when my mother called me around eight thirty. And when I woke up, it was all dark, and I hadn't switched the lights on, so I couldn't figure out what time or date it was. For a few seconds, it was just my mother's voice in the darkness and me grappling with reality. I wonder why I'm feeling so drained... The weather was nice this morning. It was drizzling when I arrived. Although in Calcutta, I hear it's been raining for the past three days."
17,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Last night was the worst. I discarded the sweater I was knitting. I only had about 14 inches completed. I lost probably $10 worth of yarn (it's $8 per skein). However, it had too many stitches by the time I reached the arm holes, and the mohair was knotting itself together as I knitted, so frogging (ripping out rows) wasn't effective. The yarn broke frequently. I didn't even swear, which is unusual for me. I just morosely ripped and listened to season two of Sex and the City (thanks to the library!). And then I grew tired of it and threw it away. I suppose I could say I gained valuable experience while attempting to make this sweater."
18,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Last night in class, we were discussing that week's assigned reading, ""Getting Back into Place: Toward a Renewed Study of the Place-World"" by Edward S. Casey. The first chapter deals with ""implacement"" and the second, ""displacement."" In the first chapter, Casey makes the distinction that our contemporary world and culture revolves around time as the situating force: we are running out of time, we have saved time, we are just in time. He argues that using place as the center of culture fosters a more grounded community. (This is a very rough summation, a disclaimer in case my professor or any classmate happens to read this post.) So far, this book is the first reading that has truly resonated with me."
19,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Whatever it is they put into freeze pops to make them those vibrant colours, there should be some sort of warning: may make your life a bit bizarre. And whilst giggling is good, one wonders if we would have found ourselves up that fire escape drinking beer in the fierce gusts had we not been eating them earlier. Finding ourselves in a doorway to a bar sadly closed for business, we stopped to examine an office-supplies catalogue that had arrived in the mail. Lucky we did. Who could possibly have guessed that within these pages were the special offers of a lifetime? Not I, for certain. I list but a few: buy 36 permanent marker pens, get a stunt kite free. Buy 30 lever arch files, get a barbecue set."
20,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Currently listening to: The Little Drummer Boy by Stevan Pasero ...and now my post... Senate Republicans, hands up - who watched the 39-hour judicial nominations debacle last week? I know I didn't. Well, okay - I did tune in once or twice. The entire colossal waste of time was perpetrated by Republicans who, upset that Democrats wouldn't roll over and nominate four of Bush's conservative justices, were trying to score political points by holding a multi-day protest. Never mind the fact that the Democrats have already approved 168 of Bush's judicial nominees - no, that's not good enough for the power-hungry Republicans who are laboring under the misapprehension that they have a huge mandate for this kind of nonsense."
21,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"This was a great weekend. I spent a lot of time outdoors, after a long time, I listened to a lot of Nevermore (something I should have started doing much earlier) and read extensively. I finished three books over the weekend - Bruce Sterling's Heavy Weather, Larry Niven's World of Ptavvs, and Octavia Butler's Parable of the Sower. Heavy Weather was a good cyberpunk romp through a near-future USA, devastated by global warming and general anarchy. While it was clever, well-paced, and altogether very convincing, I must confess that I failed to come away with any truly significant sensations about the story or the characters. Not that both aren't well-constructed and vividly etched - it's a good book, but not a great one, I suppose."
22,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Because this is the aftermath, the first week back from practicum was a struggle, but it's only in the second week that the smoke has really started to clear. Post-practicum trauma was a hidden epidemic that is only now coming to light. I was stricken, but the eventual meeting with the course coordinator allowed me to release my burden, and by doing so, I have prevented another person from being stuck with such a pedagogically deficient practicum school. Yesterday (Monday), I bumped into another aggrieved classmate who was quite determined to go to the student who was due to go to her school in the next practicum and tell him how terrible it would be. I calmed her down and said that we should go to the administrator first."
23,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Well, things are incredibly busy here at times, but there's always time for supposed stress-relieving activities. I've found that I'm really not skilled at 8-ball and ping pong. Rick, the Canadian, consistently beats me - we have a ping pong table in the front lobby of our building, always available for a 'quick round'. Last night, I participated in an 8-ball tournament at the recreation tent, which we call the 'hot spot' (complete with a popcorn machine, numerous TVs, a jukebox, DVD rental, pool table, dartboard, and an ever-present ping pong table). Anyway, I was doing fairly well throughout my one entire game - until I scratched on the eight ball. I still had a fairly good time - the most fun was when two Dutch soldiers joined in the tournament."
24,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Fall 1974: I was attempting, for what felt like the thirteenth time, to fight my way through the second chapter of my high school algebra book. I was not then, nor am I now, a math enthusiast. I detest math; I am math-phobic. You get the picture. So, as I struggled to make sense of algebra, the doorbell rang. I put down my book and went to open the door. No one was there. Great. I returned to my studies, and just as I was finding a glimmer of understanding buried in my subconscious, the doorbell rang again. Bam, just like that, my breakthrough disappeared. I went to the door, and once again, no one was there. Just what a struggling math student needs – an uninvited practical joker."
25,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"This past week has been nothing short of exhausting. I spent Tuesday to Thursday finishing the move to my new classroom. The new room is bigger and closer to my grade level team, these are the key factors I considered as I spent hours preparing my room for this year. Had I known I was going to move prior to the end of my school year, I would have discarded many of the books and supplies I no longer use. Unfortunately, it all came with me. So this week was spent moving, unpacking, and purging extensively. I have to thank my teammate Jill for helping with all of this. You see, she was still teaching this month, in my old room. So she and her lovely students moved almost my entire room for me, which was a huge relief."

Even if I never carried your child, even if I was never married to you, even if I was never an official partner to you ... I loved you immensely, and to this day the feeling carries an echo through my heart. Forever will I always be reminded of the few nights we spent together, hearts and limbs entwined in a soul-embrace, drenched in the salty darkness of an evening by the beach ... Or a kiss under the rain. Whenever I get the feeling of a dark glass piercing my heart, you will be there. That piece of you... Bleeding the eternal love that once lived in me ... And still remains. For her."

Or let me rephrase that, the article I'm working on and its consequences aren't exactly something I'm comfortable with. Perhaps it's because I don't believe in it enough, that I struggle to fully grasp its essence. The angst behind it. The full-out passion to question. I've grown up in a country where you don't ask questions. Really, you just don't. They can shoot you for that, or put you in jail under internal security acts. I'm not used to this freedom of speech...not used to questioning openly. Sure, I'm not the easiest person to get along with."
28,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"We had an outing yesterday with my colleagues at the bank. We went to Guintubdan, La Carolota. It was the first time for most of us. We trekked to the falls. It was a 30-minute or so walk. We were all catching our breaths. Whew! but we made it. The water was icy cold. You can feel your body getting numb due to the coldness. We only stayed less than an hour because we headed for the nearby waterfalls. Another 30 minutes of trekking. But the trip was worth it because the falls looked serene and the whole scene is indeed breathtaking. It's like you can hear yourself being one with nature. Soaking myself in the cold water was like communing with Mother Earth. The crisp air and water were enough to make you feel drowsy."

With a month left before Ed leaves, I think the reality is starting to sink in for Ed and all of us. I think it sunk in for me a long time ago. I just hope Ed will be here for Bailey's surgery. We've been monitoring his swelling, and there's definitely noticeable swelling."

Thankfully, I brought a bag of eggs with me just in case. So Connor had a great time finding eggs out in the park. Sunday morning, when he woke up, he was so excited that the Easter bunny had come. There's nothing better than seeing the excitement on your child's face. After egg hunting, we all went to church. Even though the 'Easter bunny' is fun, we do make sure our kids know the true meaning of the holidays. This was Megan's first Easter; she looked adorable dressed in her jean dress and stockings."

I somehow managed to get a flat tire. Luckily, I'm at work, so the guys are going to inflate it for me and make sure it holds air. If not, they're going to change my tire and put the spare on it.

And when I go upstairs after arguing with Nicole about Kelli, like I just did a few minutes ago, and they want me to tell them what's wrong. Yeah, how about you just listen!?

With this in mind: a baker's dozen of congressional Democrats, among them four New Yorkers, has petitioned U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to dispatch international observers to Florida to oversee this year's presidential balloting there. I humbly disagree. Based on the information available, the OSCE seems to be coming here to learn from the U.S. election process, not to oversee it, which was the original partisan and childish call for U.N."

By Gary Fineout and Alfonso Chardy, the citizenship ceremony in Jacksonville seemed to proceed as usual, with a crowd of nearly 200 people going home as new Americans. Just before the new citizens left the June 29 event, an immigration official directing the swearing-in ceremony urged them to stop by a voter registration table – a common sight at naturalization ceremonies. However, this table was unusual: those handing out forms were Republican volunteers – and the party affiliation box had been pre-checked to make all of the new voters members of the GOP. All of this was suspicious to Linda Cross, who was there to watch her husband, Dario Cruz, take his citizenship oath."

Nothing like 48 hours of daydreaming to get one's creative energy back. I have it good for a foreigner, and my timing was good, too. The illustration part is the icing on the cake. I'd probably complain more if that didn't fall into my lap. I know I am getting ripped off, though. I'm not blind to that fact.

Before I could blink, my best friend from Florida walked through the door, and that made me smile. I had missed him so much.

As a non-American blogger, I've been a little hesitant to get involved in some of these discussions, particularly the bits about flags, but since I started it (the subject, not the flag-burning) I suppose I'd better say something. Firstly, I think that the idea of having a law against flag-burning is utterly absurd. The moment you start according a symbol - any symbol - that kind of automatic reverence and protection, you've taken a small but significant step towards totalitarianism. Symbols are inherently fickle - they don't inherently represent anything in themselves; it's what they are perceived as meaning or made to represent that's important."

Relationship of delivery point and the use of interruptible transport on Northwest Pipeline. Is the transport upstream or downstream of the delivery point? If downstream, why isn't it being contracted for by eWeb? 2. What volume is being sold each day? You use the term DCQ and also talk about a 20% tolerance above or below the estimated quantity. Normally, there would be no tolerance with a DCQ transaction. 3. Is this envisioned to be a requirements transaction? Is the price the same for volumes in excess of the estimated quantity, up to an additional 20%?"

Absolutely amazing, I have nothing negative to say about this game as it's exceeded my expectations and will probably exceed yours too. Fluid movement, bug- and crash-free, lots of story and content to keep you engaged, with options for each day, including multiple practices, events (sponsorships), and even games. This review is purely based on playing MyCareer, and so far it's 10/10. Facescan worked really well for me (used it twice, the first attempt resulted in a misshapen forehead though..).

97,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"Magic fans beware... Wizards is hesitant to create a decent digital game. At its core, Magic: The Gathering is a social game meant to be enjoyed with friends (or frenemies), sharing laughter, trash talk, and game-winning moments. Wizards of the Coast seems to have forgotten this. If you choose to play with friends, you can't earn gold, which is crucial. Gold is so crucial that they've implemented a daily cap, understandable given that it unlocks everything in-game. However, be prepared for a long and monotonous 1v1 grind against the computer or random opponents, with whom you can't even communicate. If you choose to play for free, it will take you roughly 4 hours a day for upwards of a month, solo, to unlock the cards."
98,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"Being the 3rd installment in the trilogy, I'll address the drawbacks first. I generally dislike prequels as they technically move the story backward rather than forward (a common issue with prequels). However, they often provide more narrative depth. The combat feels sloppy and lacks the sharpness that Arkham City achieved. As of writing this recommendation (26/10/2013), a game-breaking bug prevents a side mission from being completed (the main story remains unaffected). Some gadgets are assigned to inconvenient hotkeys, requiring your hand to travel across the keyboard to access them. Although it may seem minor, this can disrupt your combo during combat."
99,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"They basically fixed Shadow Warrior (2013), i.e. The boss fights are awesome, weapons feel very nice (maybe not as good as D44M's ones, but still solid), enemies aren't too resilient (if you're not too inexperienced with handling elemental and upgrade aspects). The upgrade system is really balanced and once you get the hang of it, it's not too tedious. The elemental aspects and limited ammo softly encourage you to use different weapons. Lots of cool unique (being the key word here while comparing SW2 to Borderlands' formula of 'rng' weapons) weapons that stay viable throughout most of the game. The music is great, especially the main theme and of course Stan Bush's contributions."
100,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"So many things were made wrong. I don't even know how to start this review. This all refers to my career. My player is an outside scorer, point guard, 1.71m, with maxed stats and all necessary perks. Now, tell me, why does the shooting skill depend on a person's height? Why can a person who is 1.74m not become as good a shooter as a person with 1.71m? I'm 1.87m in real life, made my first player with this height and noticed then that I couldn't reach a higher skill than 89. Why? That's pure discrimination! And why doesn't the game inform me of this before I create a character, or even when I reach the skill limit after weeks of playing?"
101,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"I think this Assassin's Creed nailed the mechanics down on all fronts (ship battles, sailing, hunting, parkour, etc). I felt much more attached to this character as well. The story starts out extremely rough but does get significantly better as you play (I think this is the case with every AC game personally). Edward was quite an interesting character, and so were all the side characters. I felt like all the collectibles actually served a purpose in this AC game, which I never experienced in the previous ones, and maybe it's because they had a bigger impact on the game. They definitely weren't required, but they were fun to obtain and you got rewarded in a very balanced way."
102,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"While I personally cannot recommend this game, it wasn't absolutely terrible. The gunplay is alright, as long as you have the money to purchase gun parts, which would be my main complaint with this game: it's pay-to-win. If I could get past that, the game would be enjoyable, as the hardsuit is fun to use and HRV is an excellent concept. I'd take this game over any Call of Duty title any day, but its pay-to-win microtransaction format is off-putting for me. If you are alright with this model, then by all means, have fun. But if you're like me and dislike pay-to-win games, just let this one slide; it's not our cup of tea."
103,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"While not perfect, this game has been greatly enjoyable. The save system and possibility of sudden death lead to some frustration. I'm on my first playthrough and I lost my main character around hour 10 of 20ish. I would have really liked a save to reload at that point. I've since picked up a 3rd-party mod/save tool to avoid catastrophic failures. Plus, the aiming reticule is on the small side, and the zoom is underpowered. With all that said, it's been a blast. I'm not normally a zombie fan, but the combination of strategy, missions, first-person shooter/beat 'em up is great. I've been playing it as often as I can get away... Just one more mission, just one more supply run – or I'm running away and want to get safe before shutting the game down."
104,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"An absolutely great strategy game. Having played every single other wargame (European Escalation, and ALB), I have to say this one fits well. The number of units is impressive. Not sure exactly how many units there are, but there's a vast array. Graphics are just beautiful, sounds are great, and the gameplay overall is epic. The in-game chat box at the main menu is very entertaining as well, no I am not kidding. However, if anyone thinks this game is 'easy', or if you are new to the strategy genre, it could take you quite some time to master. Do not get upset, you will lose a lot of units. Just make sure you plan ahead, always have anti-air, and anti-tank."
105,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"I was initially biased against this game before playing it. I wasn't even sure about purchasing it. I don't know, the portal gun and portal concept seemed unusual to me, despite my fondness for science fiction. Boy, was I wrong. The jokes and voice acting in this game are phenomenal - just amazing. It's not overly cheesy (okay, it's sometimes cheesy). Different story characters have their own sense of humor. Those characters genuinely have distinct personalities. And the level design is impressive. By the way, I never played the first Portal game. One of these days, I plan to if I can spare the time. I wouldn't have played it if I hadn't played the sequel."
106,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"Let's start with the pros and cons, followed by my thoughts on this game. +Some of the best characters +Good story +Loads of content +Customizable character (you can be male or female, whatever you like) +You can have a relationship with most of your companions (yes, fangirls, you can have a love interest) -Poor graphics (I don't think graphics really matter anyway) -Weird and awkward love scenes -Invisible walls -There's one mission that, in my opinion, was boring, but everyone has different tastes -+ Um, this isn't really bad or good, but for those who care, your protagonist can't talk. Okay, now for my thoughts. I love this game. This game is probably one of the best RPGs or games in general I have ever played. So, if you're an RPG fan, you probably already have this game."
107,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"Yes, this is a nostalgia trip for thirty-somethings who remember (at least in the UK) watching the ever-irritating Timmy Mallet just for the five-minute Transformers cartoon. The voice actors for Optimus, Megatron, Bumblebee, and many others are back, and instantly recognisable. The distinctive cartoon transformation sound is there. Graphically, the cell-shaded presentation is perfect, and very, very Generation One. But aside from that, it's actually a very enjoyable game. The combat mechanics are extremely well done. Transforming mid-fight is often a necessity, and woven seamlessly into combos, making it quite unlike High Moon's excellent War for/Fall of Cybertron games. Another distinction is the heavy focus on melee combat, but some enemies (e.g. Seekers) require a switch to a ranged blaster for optimal results."
108,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"I downloaded the game and played it briefly, but it was unimpressive. I spent more time trying to log in than actually playing. There's a bug where it claims there's an update to the terms of service, and clicking 'accept' only makes it pop up again. You have to restart the client for it to work. Although that's not terrible, I question why linking my Steam and Gface accounts is necessary. They claim it's for DLC, but why is that required? It's also irreversible, so now a company I'm not invested in has access to my Steam information. The game itself is mediocre. It's easily recognizable as a COD clone, except somehow they managed to make the gunplay worse... How is that even possible?"

110,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"I experienced no performance issues even at release, and after all these patches it runs smoothly. In my opinion, this is a really great and fun game, although the format may be somewhat annoying (where the free-roam city area repopulates with new enemies every time you progress the story). I particularly enjoyed the 'dual play' segments (where you can play as Batman and one more character), and the ability to use the controller for most segments of the game but the mouse and keyboard for the tank combat segments was greatly appreciated. Driving your batmobile around the free-roam city, including when chasing the APC commanders, is actually quite enjoyable once you figure out how to use the brakes to skid around corners (and when you master that, driving around the city is really quite enjoyable!)"
111,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"Damn fine aaa fps shooter - that's the bottom line. It's visually stunning, sounds great and plays exceptionally well - great fps mechanics, engaging story, cool characters, flawless voice acting, and an awesome soundtrack. Not for the faint hearted though - some of those cutscenes were pretty darn cruel and vivid. But when a game overall is so great, it's easier to spot the flaws, and here they are as I saw 'em: - no sli support - what a disappointment? I had to put the game away until I upgraded my card, as it ran poorly on my old dual gpu gtx 590.

However, don't buy this game thinking it's like COD, Battlefield, or any other shooter game. It's a game in its own class and should be treated as such. I've lost count of how many times I hear new players rant and complain about getting killed quickly. Oh, the shock of getting shot in the face and dying. It's not like that doesn't happen in real life or anything. Edit: Having played this game for a while now, I've invested a significant amount of money into it. One of the best multiplayer games around. A great alternative to play when you're not in the mood for CS:GO."
114,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"I'm 2 hours in and am thoroughly enjoying this game. So hilarious. Gameplay is solid, art design is stunning, music is surprisingly high quality and fitting, the story/world has me intrigued, and the puzzles are entertaining. But the standout aspect of this game is its comedy. If you've played any RPG since the dawn of video game RPGs, you'll laugh at the various jokes, parodies, and references; if you're new to RPGs, you'll still appreciate the game's humor. If you played Final Fantasy 7 or X, you absolutely need to play this game - without giving too much away... I had to pause after 2 hours to give my cheeks a break from laughing and smiling so much. What a delight so far."
115,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"I'm really sorry, I try to be supportive of free-to-play games and indie developers, but I really didn't enjoy this game. The description sounded right up my alley, but the execution fell short. I love puzzle and exploration games, but I found this game to be completely unintuitive, and even after looking up how to progress, I still simply didn't find the gameplay itself enjoyable. It also lacks a pause button, or if it does have one, I never found it. Considering that many sequences in the game are timed, this seems like a critical oversight. I also feel like this game is more cut scene than gameplay, and I end up just sitting around, waiting impatiently."
116,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"This game... Phew, where to even start. It was absolutely breathtaking, from story to graphics, I was hooked. The story wasn't just any story, but actually felt like I was that person, trying to figure out what came next in the story my character was telling. Gameplay was great, and I learned a lot about myself through this game, mainly my fear of heights, which I never had a problem with until the ice caverns. My gut churned the whole time, but I kept going for Uncle Fred. If you guys made a DLC or second game, I would be the first to buy it and recommend it to everyone I know. Thanks to everyone involved in making this; you created an absolutely beautiful game."

In previous games, you progressed through the earth's timeline, experiencing periods like the Stone Age, Medieval Age, and Modern Age; however, in this game, you're set in the future on a mission to colonize a new planet. What I enjoy about this game is that 2K took a new approach and added mechanics such as the affinity system and orbital layer. What I didn't enjoy was that these new mechanics could be overwhelming at times. What I think could be improved in this game is that they could incorporate some new artwork, such as the environment you experience when communicating with another leader, to enhance the overall experience."
118,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"Great game! Tons of replayability and a very fun zombie survival experience. Definitely in my top 5 zombie games ever played. Edit: after playing 60+ hours, I can honestly say this is one of the better, more 'realistic' zombie games. It's very much designed like a survival horror, where you must conserve ammo, heal your own wounds when you bleed out, take pills when you're infected, etc. Also, I find the zombies to feel very natural and well-animated for a free-to-play game. P.S.: I would recommend getting 1 or 2 friends to play with, but the community is super friendly, and you can usually make friends or chat with people in the chat or over voice comms."
119,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"02/07/2014 - it's a shame I can't thoroughly recommend or enjoy this game, as from the short time I've played it, I know I'd be addicted if it didn't have the following two game breakers. No Aussie servers - one red bar puts you at a severe disadvantage and creates unbearable lag. Mind you, I played through the offline training mode and it was stuttering and lagging as well (how does that even happen?). Couple that with the poor ping, and it just ruins the experience. Everything is plagued by artifacts - the menus, backgrounds, training, and in-game. I've never had this happen before with this card and thought it might not like my overclock. I set my GPU back to stock and, sure enough, it didn't make a difference."
120,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"Very late last night, I finished this. Although the story isn't particularly deep or interesting, the storytelling is what makes it stand out. The atmosphere is rich and immersive, and the numerous collectibles do a great job of fleshing it out. I gained a lot of insight into the world of Batman, so it was somewhat disappointing that there were so few bosses in the game. However, there are plenty of future games to rectify that. The combat offers the right amount of challenge, but it's slightly on the easy side. Leveling up Batman wasn't very satisfying. It's the gadgets you upgrade and acquire during the campaign that add nice new gameplay mechanics. Gaining access to previously unreachable places creates a nice sense of progression."
121,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"'To the Moon' is no mere game... Nay, it is a veritable experience, and it was one of the most memorable of my life at that. Think Telltale's The Walking Dead is sad? Hohoho! Well, it's no match for 'To the Moon'! Never before have I felt so emotionally drained yet fulfilled over something purely fictional. This masterpiece represents the pinnacle of storytelling in my opinion, and the soundtrack is a gorgeously charming and perfect accompaniment. Yes, the controls can be a bit finicky and the gameplay isn't the strong point, but the story is so fantastic that I didn't care one bit. Plus, the humor in the game is great as well and it doesn't intrude upon the distinguished nature of the story... And the Doctor Who references are endless and delightful."
122,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"Bastion is a bloody brilliant game, with a really great storyline. Set after a calamity has occurred, you start to rebuild on the bastion. There's quite a lot of choice in the game, with the choice of what to build to gain an advantage, what weapons to use and what power-ups to equip them with, as well as what drinks to use to give you a bonus effect. The art style and music in the game are fantastic, everything looks so vibrant at times, who says the apocalypse has to be dull. Best of all, the game features narration based on what you, the player, do. So if you end up picking up a weapon then switch it for another in the armoury, the narration would say something about you taking along the new weapon."
123,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"I had originally purchased this game in early development, when the only currency was spacebux, and there was no 'tech tree'. This was when the game was enjoyable. All of the guns at this point were equally overpowered, so there were no issues with imbalance; everyone could kill anyone at any time. Also, the game used to provide unlimited gun slots and five loadouts. You would think that for a game with 'bajillions of guns', they would at least offer more than 6 weapon slots and 3 loadouts before requiring payment for additional slots. At one point, I had about 3 pages worth of guns, and was planning new ideas for more, because personally, that's where I found it fun."
124,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"This game was a surprising gem. One often sees rave reviews of certain products that are often misleading. In this case, the reviews accurately reflect the fun of this neat little game. It is an odd yet intriguing mix between a classic 2D platformer and a MOBA, and it pulls it off with style. I found myself enjoying characters that I wouldn't typically enjoy in other MOBA games. I had expected this trait to continue, but decided to give a melee tank a try anyway. I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome and ended up trying out more as they were unlocked through gameplay. The art style and interface are oddly charming. As such, I now use one of the characters as my avatar and a wallpaper created from a card set for the game."
125,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"I just started playing, but I love this game. I put on my headphones and lose myself in the game for hours at a time. It's been a while since a game has had that effect on me. The music sets the mood, the sound effects are spot on, and the controls are perfect. I look forward to every combat, and they've optimized combat extremely well. I had my doubts about the naval combat system, but it is so much fun to lay waste to multiple fleets at a time! The only way to lose in this game is to fail to retreat. If the combat looks overwhelming, just get out of there, regroup, and counter-attack. Thanks, devs, for an awesome experience!"
126,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"The reboot of the Devil May Cry franchise has brought about many changes for the series, particularly for the series' protagonist, Dante. While fans of the original series may be upset at the change to their beloved character, it's certainly for the better; and this new game by Ninja Theory proves it. DmC serves as the perfect point for newcomers to jump into the series. It shows the origins of an arrogant, cynical Dante, and it chronicles his journey from cynicism to selflessness. Throughout, the game weaves a clear narrative arc for the new Dante, making him a compelling character to watch. Imagine the story follows Dante as he's introduced into the corrupt world he willfully chose to ignore."
127,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"Where do I start with this absolutely beautiful game? Its story is absolutely charming, with so much detail put into it, and it's a bundle of happiness, bad puns, annoying dogs, and secrets. It's serious when it needs to be, but isn't a stranger to humorous moments. The character design is on point, with various characters having unique personalities and secrets. It stands out from other RPGs because you don't have to kill anyone, an underutilized concept in RPGs. With lots of inspiration from Earthbound, one of the best RPGs I've seen, you can tell it's going to be good. It easily has the best soundtrack I've heard in a long time."

As for my experience, the 'game' had no impact on me. Half the story relies on shock value. I was neither shocked nor emotionally moved in any way by this. Maybe I'm desensitized, or maybe it was too simplistic to warrant a reaction from me. As for the other half of the game, it attempts to paint a picture (literally) of a person in mental decline. It explores obsession, hallucination, depression, and a few other themes. In theory, it's a cool idea. But the 'game' took me 10 minutes to complete, and that's with reading and taking in every bit of information I could."

It's an amazing way to test your mind while still being enjoyable. Although this game isn't as story-driven, it did give birth to one of the most popular games of 2011. I still play this game and beat it when I'm feeling bored, and I love to come back and see what gave birth to a legend and what is a legend. Gameplay: Portal's gameplay is quite simple to explain, at least. You use portals to your advantage, along with buttons that activate a part of the puzzle. Two types of buttons are in the game: one that you press and one that requires a cube to be placed on it."

Divinity: Dragon Commander reaches awfully close to the borders of my personal most favourite RTS game. Combine this with a huge Risk-like grand strategy mode and it hits the spot. I try not to be overly biased due to the fact that this game allows you to turn into a dragon, aiding your troops by supporting, attacking, and even commanding unit production, direction, and spawning at the same time. Honestly, I do like the complicated RTS games nowadays, such as Civ V. However, such games attempt to cram complex mechanics, charts, and resources into one complicated game mode, often to their detriment."

The graphics are solid for a retro title and the music is pleasant, but paired together they create some truly beautiful and impactful moments.

And all of this without touching on the world, characters, story, gameplay... I could write whole pages about it. But instead, I'll just say this: if you like RPGs, play this game.

There is a fairly steep learning curve to the game's mechanics, which I am still trying to master; however, this breadth of strategy allows you a myriad of ways to reach goals and capitalize on certain situations. The game, in my mind, is almost infinitely replayable. I find myself fully immersed in every session I play, regardless of how the play-through is going."

After those few enjoyable hours, you'll begin to notice that the only thing left for the game to offer is repetition in its combat, enemies, and gameplay. The one major high point for the game is that the developers are working diligently and release semi-frequent updates that generally include a substantial amount of content, from sweeping changes to some of the game's systems, new warframes, and other tweaks and features. It's a good game to play casually. Though I doubt it will hold your attention beyond a few months unless you genuinely enjoy grinding. The upside to all of this is that the game is free, so I'd recommend giving it a try. If you're looking for a quick fix, try it out."

In this game, you absorb increasingly larger objects to grow bigger and absorb more. However, the gameplay isn't as smooth as it could be, the levels lack inventiveness, and the overall experience is a surreal, unsettling horror show. I don't mean an entertaining horror show, but one that leaves you feeling rather depressed and questioning the value of life. Every 'living' creature in this game, from small pets to human beings, makes me wonder if the creators had a fascination with taxidermy."

I thought, 'oh wow! a simulator of the road to becoming president! that sounds fun!' well, it really wasn't. The game starts you off and says you need to pick a side: Republican or Democrat, there is no Independent, or third party. A little disappointed, but still optimistic, I carried on to see what I could do. I will give the game credit, the character customization, although limited, is pretty fun to mess around with.

For one thing, I have a Vive and I'm much more interested in playing room-sized games with the controllers. Beyond that, the game is initially awe-inspiring in the scale of its universe, but I also felt that same scale hindered my enjoyment. The learning curve and the time required to do anything interesting at the beginning were both too large for me.

Single hits to the chest, neck, or head from rifle-caliber weapons almost always result in death unless it just grazes you. Rounds drop over distance, and short, controlled bursts are required if you wish to remain on target. There is no magical ammunition pool. If you reload halfway through your magazine all the time, then you will have a pouch full of half-full mags. You can't run forever. If you sprint for a while, your aim will suffer as you gasp heavily until you've caught your breath. Rest your weapon on your elbows while prone or on a windowsill to steady your aim.

As a result, I never experienced the issues that some people claim to have had with that game. I loved that game, however; it was unforgiving in the early stages but rewarding when you did things right. As for XCOM2, I love it - the game plays pretty well for me on medium, and I'm running a GTX560 with 2GB of VRAM. Initially, the game was set to high, and it was running a bit sluggishly, but not to the point of being unplayable. When I dropped it down to medium, it smoothed out.

It is thought that 40% of those buying home net security programs are retirees. Over the last three years, this figure has increased by an average of 13.2%. However, more retired women (53%) were purchasing security software than retired men. The research reflects the changing stereotype and demographics of web users, as well as growing awareness of the greater risks posed by high-speed broadband internet connections to surfers."

However, more and more iPod owners are filling that space with audio content created by an unpredictable assortment of producers. This phenomenon is called ""podcasting,"" and its strongest proponent is former MTV host and VJ (video jockey) Adam Curry. Podcasting takes its name from the Apple iPod, although an iPod is not required to create or listen to a podcast. Essentially, a podcast is an internet-based radio show that podcasters create, often in the comfort of their own home. They need only a microphone, a PC, and some editing software to produce their shows, which they then upload to the internet for others to download and listen to, free of charge."

McAllister himself scored the second when he met Saul Mikoliunas' cross at the back post to put the game beyond the visitors' reach. Craig Easton headed in a contentious goal after an hour, but Hearts held on. The opening goal came after Gus Bahoken had clumsily fouled Miller 35 yards from goal. McAllister floated the free kick into the Livi box, and Miller outjumped the static visiting defence to loop his header from 10 yards over Meldrum.

In addition to inducing ever larger and more tangible objects into a regime of quantum behavior, this new capability has inspired ideas of utilizing mechanical oscillators in the processing and communication of quantum information and as precision force sensors operating beyond the standard quantum limit. However, the effectively linear interaction between motion and light or electricity precludes access to the broader class of quantum states of motion, such as cat states or energy squeezed states. Indeed, early optomechanical proposals noted the possibility to overcome this restriction by creating strong quadratic coupling of motion to light. Although there have been experimental demonstrations of quadratically coupled optomechanical systems, these have not yet accessed nonclassical states of motion."

Spamming strategies are difficult to capture, as they can vary rapidly over time, differ across spammers and target products, and, more critically, often remain unknown. Furthermore, most existing detectors prioritize detection accuracy, which does not align well with the goal of maintaining trustworthy product evaluations. To address these challenges, we formulate a minimax game where spammers and spam detectors compete with each other on practical goals that are not solely based on detection accuracy. The Nash equilibria of the game lead to stable detectors that are agnostic to any mixed detection strategies."

To ensure high fidelity, we employed the Lewis-Riesenfeld (L-R) method to derive a family of solutions leading to an exact transfer, where the solutions follow a single dynamical mode of the L-R invariant. Among this family, we identified a tracking solution with a single parameter to control simultaneously the fidelity of the transfer, the population of the excited state, and robustness. We defined a measure of the robustness of an ultra-high-fidelity transfer as the minimum percentile deviation on the pulse areas at which the infidelity rises above $10^{-4}$. The robustness of our shaped pulses was found superior to that of Gaussian and adiabatically-optimized pulses for moderate pulse areas."

Due to nonconvexity, multiple local minima exist that are not globally optimal, even when the mixture is well-separated. We show that all local minima share a common structural form that partially identifies the component centers of the true mixture, in the sense that each local minimum involves a non-overlapping combination of fitting multiple Gaussians to a single true component and fitting a single Gaussian to multiple true components. Our results apply to the setting where the true mixture components satisfy a certain separation condition, and are valid even when the number of components is over- or under-specified. For Gaussian mixtures with three components, we obtain sharper results in terms of the scaling with the separation between the components."

A widely used tool for detecting entanglement is an entanglement witness, where the measurement of the witness operator is guaranteed to be positive for all separable states and can be negative for certain entangled states. In reality, due to the exponentially increasing Hilbert-space dimension with respect to the system size, it is very challenging to construct an efficient entanglement witness for general multipartite entangled states. For $n$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-like states, the most robust witness scheme requires $n+1$ local measurement settings and can tolerate up to $1/2$ white noise. In comparison, the most efficient witness for GHZ-like states only needs two local measurement settings and can tolerate up to $1/3$ white noise."

We develop a general method to extract the multipole moments of arbitrary stationary spacetimes and apply it to a large family of horizonless microstate geometries. The latter can break the axial and equatorial symmetry of the Kerr metric, yielding a much richer multipolar structure that provides a portal to constrain fuzzball models phenomenologically. We find numerical evidence that all multipole moments are typically larger (in absolute value) than those of a Kerr black hole with the same mass and spin. Current measurements of the quadrupole moment of black-hole candidates can place only mild constraints on fuzzballs, while future gravitational-wave detections of extreme mass-ratio inspirals with the space mission LISA will significantly improve these bounds by orders of magnitude."

We consider a common case in which edges can represent short-term interactions (e.g., messaging) or long-term structural connections (e.g., friendship). In practice, long-term edges are often manually specified by humans. Human-specified edges can be both costly to produce and suboptimal for the downstream task. To alleviate these issues, we propose a model based on temporal point processes and variational autoencoders that learns to infer temporal attention between nodes by observing node communication patterns. As temporal attention drives between-node feature propagation, using the dynamics of node interactions to learn this key component provides more flexibility while simultaneously avoiding issues associated with human-specified edges."

In particular, the restriction homomorphisms between the orthogonal, unitary, and symplectic groups of adjacent dimensions are naturally split epimorphisms. The interest in the splitting stems from equivariant stable homotopy theory. The equivariant stable homotopy groups of every global spectrum form a global Mackey functor, so the splittings imply that certain long exact homotopy group sequences decompose into short exact sequences.

The poorly constrained shape and amplitude of this suppression is a significant source of uncertainties for upcoming cosmological weak lensing surveys, such as Euclid or LSST. In this first paper in a series of two, we utilize simulations to construct a Euclid-like tomographic mock data-set for the cosmic shear power spectrum and the corresponding covariance matrix, both corrected for baryonic effects using the baryonification method of Schneider et al. (2019). In addition, we develop an emulator to obtain fast predictions of the baryonic power suppression, enabling us to perform a likelihood inference analysis for a standard $\lambda$CDM cosmology with both cosmological and astrophysical parameters."
213,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,paper_abstract,"Spontaneous conversations in real-world settings, such as those found in child-centered recordings, have been shown to be among the most challenging audio files to process. Nevertheless, building speech processing models that handle such a wide variety of conditions would be particularly useful for language acquisition studies, in which researchers are interested in the quantity and quality of the speech that children hear and produce, as well as for early diagnosis and measuring the effects of remediation. In this paper, we present our approach to designing an open-source neural network to classify audio segments into vocalizations produced by the child wearing the recording device, vocalizations produced by other children, adult male speech, and adult female speech. To this end, we gathered diverse child-centered corpora, totaling 260 hours of recordings and covering 10 languages."
214,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,paper_abstract,"Density-based clustering relies on the idea of linking groups to specific features of the underlying probability distribution. The reference to a true, yet unknown, population structure allows framing the clustering problem in a standard inferential setting, where ideal population clustering is defined as the partition induced by the true density function. The nonparametric formulation of this approach, known as modal clustering, draws a correspondence between groups and the domains of attraction of the density modes. Operationally, a nonparametric density estimate is required, and proper selection of the amount of smoothing, governing the density's shape and hence possibly its modal structure, is crucial for identifying the final partition. In this work, we address the issue of density estimation for modal clustering from an asymptotic perspective."
215,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,paper_abstract,"The tails of diboson production at the LHC are sensitive to the interference between the Standard Model and higher dimension operators parameterizing the effects of heavy new physics. However, helicity selection rules for the diboson scattering amplitudes pose an obstruction to the naive interference contributions of dimension six operators, causing the total diboson rate correction's leading contribution to cancel. In this case, carefully measuring the azimuthal decay angles ""resurrects"" the interference, recouping sensitivity to the ""non-interfering"" operators. We explore these signatures in detail and find that the EFT uncertainties associated with higher-dimensional operators are uniquely well-suppressed by constructing an asymmetry variable generated solely by these non-interfering operators, relegating the effects of higher-dimensional, interfering operators to the same status as statistical errors in this observable."
216,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,paper_abstract,"Causal inference from observational data is a primary objective of many data analyses in the health and social sciences. However, academic statistics has often been skeptical of data analyses with a causal objective. The emergence of the term ""data science"" presents a historic opportunity to redefine data analysis in a way that naturally incorporates causal inference from observational data. Like others before, we categorize the scientific contributions of data science into three classes of tasks: description, prediction, and counterfactual prediction (which encompasses causal inference). An explicit classification of data science tasks is necessary to discuss the data, assumptions, and analytics required to successfully accomplish each task. We argue that a failure to adequately describe the role of subject-matter expert knowledge in data analysis is a source of widespread misconceptions about data science."
217,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,paper_abstract,"The weak gravity conjecture (wgc) necessitates the existence of superextremal particles in any consistent quantum theory of gravity. The standard lore posits that these particles ensure extremal black holes are either unstable or marginally stable, but it is unclear what the implications are if this doesn't occur. This note demonstrates that, for a generic Einstein quantum theory of gravity in AdS, exact stability of extremal black branes conflicts with rigorously proven quantum information theorems regarding entanglement entropy. Resolving the contradiction yields a nonperturbative version of the wgc, which reduces to the usual statement at weak coupling. The argument is general, relying solely on the validity of Einsteinian gravity, effective field theory, and holography, without assuming supersymmetry or a specific UV completion."
218,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,paper_abstract,"Understanding how strongly correlated two-dimensional systems can give rise to unconventional superconductivity with high critical temperatures is a major unsolved problem in condensed matter physics. Ultracold 2D Fermi gases have emerged as clean, controllable model systems to study the interplay of strong correlations and reduced dimensionality, but direct evidence of superfluidity in these systems has been lacking. Here, we demonstrate superfluidity in an ultracold 2D Fermi gas by moving a periodic potential through the system and observing no dissipation below a critical velocity v$_{\rm c}$. We measure v$_{\rm c}$ as a function of interaction strength and find a maximum in the crossover regime between bosonic and fermionic superfluidity. Our measurement establishes ultracold Fermi gases as a powerful tool for studying the influence of reduced dimensionality on strongly correlated superfluids."
219,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,paper_abstract,"Ordinary differential equation (ODE) is a mathematical model utilized in various application areas, such as climatology, bioinformatics, and chemical engineering, due to its intuitive appeal to modeling. Despite the widespread use of ODEs in modeling, the frequent absence of their analytic solutions makes it challenging to estimate ODE parameters from data, especially when the model has numerous variables and parameters. This paper proposes a Bayesian ODE parameter estimation algorithm that is both fast and accurate, even for models with many parameters. The proposed method approximates an ODE model with a state-space model based on the equations of a numerical solver. It enables fast estimation by avoiding computations of the entire numerical solution in the likelihood. The posterior is obtained using a variational Bayes method, specifically the approximate Riemannian conjugate gradient method (Honkela et al."

We find that the differential conductance and induced pairing amplitudes strongly depend on the angle between the junction direction in real space and the axis separating the Weyl nodes in momentum space. We identify the influence of a chiral chemical potential, i.e., the electron population imbalance between Weyl nodes of opposite chirality, on the junction's transport characteristics. Remarkably, we observe a net spin polarization of Cooper pairs generated via Andreev reflection in the two WSM regions. The spin polarization is opposite in the two WSM regions and highly sensitive to the chirality imbalance and excitation energy."
221,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,paper_abstract,"Metal ion implantation into ceramics has been demonstrated to be an effective and controllable technique for tailoring the surface electrical conductivity of the ceramic piece, and this approach has been utilized in various applications. Importantly, it provides a method for grading the voltage drop across high voltage insulators, thereby increasing the maximum operational voltage that can be applied across the insulator without surface flashover. However, a concern for the use of this method is the long-term stability of the implantation-induced conductivity, particularly if the implanted metal species is readily oxidized. Here we report on our examination of the long-term behavior of the surface conductivity of titanium-implanted alumina. The results indicate that after an initial drop of up to 40% in the first few weeks following implantation, the conductivity exhibits only a very slow decrease of approximately 10% over the subsequent year."
222,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,paper_abstract,"We introduce a novel Skyrme-like conserved current in the effective theory of pions and vector mesons, based on the concept of hidden local symmetry. The associated charge is equivalent to the skyrmion charge for any smooth configuration. Additionally, there exist singular configurations that can be identified as n_f=1 baryons, charged under the new symmetry. Under this identification, the vector mesons play the role of Chern-Simons vector fields living on the quantum Hall droplet that forms the n_f=1 baryon. We propose that this current is the correct effective expression for the baryon current at low energies. This proposal provides a unified picture for the two types of baryons, allowing them to continuously transform into one another in a natural way. Furthermore, Chern-Simons dualities on the droplet can be interpreted as a result of Seiberg-like duality between gluons and vector mesons."
223,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,paper_abstract,"Interfacial spin-orbit coupling in Josephson junctions offers an intriguing way to combine anomalous Hall and Josephson physics in a single device. We study theoretically how the superposition of both effects impacts the transport properties of superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator/superconductor junctions. Transverse momentum-dependent skew tunneling of Cooper pairs through the spin-active ferromagnetic insulator interface creates sizable transverse Hall supercurrents, which we refer to as anomalous Josephson Hall effect currents. We generalize the Furusaki-Tsukada formula, initially established to quantify usual tunneling Josephson current flows, to evaluate the transverse current components and demonstrate that their amplitudes are widely adjustable by means of the spin-orbit coupling strengths or the superconducting phase difference across the junction. As a clear spectroscopic fingerprint of Josephson junctions, well-localized subgap bound states form near the interface."

(2020), that dipoles are as crucial to the dynamics of decaying two-dimensional turbulence as individual vortex cores, it is found that the kinetic energy of this flow is carried by elongated streams formed by the concatenation of dipoles. Vortices separate into a family of small, fast-moving cores and another family of larger, slowly moving ones, which can be described as 'frozen' into a slowly evolving 'crystal'. The kinematics of both families are very different, and only the former is self-similar. The latter is responsible for most of the kinetic energy of the flow, and its vortices form the dipoles and the streams. Mechanisms are discussed for the growth of this slow component."

Often, the running time of quantum algorithms in this framework is characterized by the quantum hitting time: the time required for a quantum walk to locate a vertex of interest with high probability. In this article, we provide improved upper bounds for the quantum hitting time that can be applied to several CTQW-based quantum algorithms. In particular, we apply our techniques to the glued-trees problem, improving its hitting time upper bound by a polynomial factor: from $o(n^5)$ to $o(n^2\log n)$. Furthermore, our methods also help to exponentially improve the precision dependence of the continuous-time quantum walk-based algorithm to find a marked node on any ergodic, reversible Markov chain by Chakraborty et al."

Dry (or the ""loss-cone"") EMRIs, previously considered as the main EMRI sources for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, are primarily produced by multi-body scattering in the nuclear star cluster and gravitational capture. In this letter, we highlight an alternative EMRI formation channel: (wet) EMRI formation assisted by the accretion flow around accreting galactic-center massive black holes (MBHs). In this channel, the accretion disk captures stellar-mass black holes that are initially moving on inclined orbits, and subsequently drives them to migrate towards the MBH - this process significantly boosts the formation rate of EMRIs in such galaxies by orders of magnitude."

This problem falls into the new user cold-start category and is crucial to the development and even survival of a company. Existing works on user cold-start recommendation either require additional user efforts, e.g., setting up an interview process, or utilize side information [10] such as user demographics, locations, social relations, etc. However, users may be unwilling to participate in the interview, and side information on cold-start users is usually not available."

It has also been successfully applied in wireless communications, despite the current radio systems being well-understood and optimal algorithms existing for many tasks. While some gains have been obtained by learning individual components of a receiver, a more effective approach is to jointly learn the entire receiver. This, however, often results in a challenging nonlinear problem, for which the optimal solution is impractical to implement. To this end, we propose a deep fully convolutional neural network, deeprx, which executes the entire receiver pipeline from frequency domain signal stream to uncoded bits in a 5G-compliant manner. We facilitate accurate channel estimation by constructing the input of the convolutional neural network in a specific manner using both data and pilot symbols."
229,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,paper_abstract,"Mutation-based fuzzing typically uses an initial set of non-crashing seed inputs (a corpus) from which to generate new inputs through mutation. A corpus of potential seeds often contains thousands of similar inputs, resulting in a lack of diversity. This can lead to wasted fuzzing effort due to exhaustive mutation from all available seeds. To address this, fuzzers come with distillation tools (e.g., afl-cmin) that select the smallest subset of seeds triggering the same range of instrumentation data points as the full corpus. Common practice suggests that minimizing the number and cumulative size of seeds leads to more efficient fuzzing, which we explore systematically. We present results of over 34 cpu-years of fuzzing with five distillation approaches to understand their impact on finding bugs in real-world software."

The agents can be divided into several groups, each with similar (isomorphic) state transition structures, allowing them to be relabeled into the same template. Based on this template, a scalable supervisor is designed, whose state size and computational cost are independent of the number of agents, for the case of partial observation. The scalable supervisor under partial observation does not require recomputation, regardless of the number of agents added to or removed from the system. We generalize our earlier results to partial observation by proposing sufficient conditions for safety and maximal permissiveness of the scalable least restrictive supervisor at the template level. An example is provided to illustrate the proposed scalable supervisory synthesis approach."

An efficient approach for enf estimation is introduced using temporal windowing based on the filter-bank Capon spectral estimator.

Moreover, this approach employs, for the first time in the field of enf, a non-rectangular temporal window at the stage preceding spectral estimation. Krylov matrices facilitate fast implementation of matrix inversions. The proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in enf estimation when a short time window of 1 second is used in power recordings. In speech recordings, the proposed approach yields highly accurate results in terms of both time complexity and accuracy."

The package also contains a set of classical and robust pre-processing utilities, including generalized spatial signs, as well as dedicated plotting functionality and cross-validation utilities.

Here, we studied the fluorescence anomalous saturating effect of the nitrogen vacancy defect in diamond. The fluorescence reduction was observed with high-power laser excitation. It increased the nonlinearity of the fluorescence emission, and altered the spatial frequency distribution of the fluorescence image. We used a differential excitation protocol to extract high spatial frequency information. By modulating the excitation laser's power, the spatial resolution of imaging was improved approximately 1.6 times compared to confocal microscopy. Due to the simplicity of the experimental setup and data processing, we expect this method can be used to improve the spatial resolution of sensing and biological labeling with defects in solids."
234,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,paper_abstract,"When random effects are correlated with sample design variables, the usual approach of employing individual survey weights (constructed to be inversely proportional to the unit survey inclusion probabilities) to form a pseudo-likelihood no longer yields asymptotically unbiased inference. We develop a weight-exponentiated formulation for the random effects distribution that achieves unbiased inference for generating hyperparameters of the random effects. We contrast our approach with frequentist methods that rely on numerical integration to reveal that only the Bayesian method achieves both unbiased estimation with respect to the sampling design distribution and consistency with respect to the population generating distribution. Our simulations and real data example for a survey of business establishments demonstrate the utility of our approach across different modeling formulations and sampling designs. This work serves as a culmination of recent developmental efforts that combine traditional survey estimation approaches with the Bayesian modeling paradigm and provides a bridge across the two rich but disparate sub-fields."

These main processes replace each other within a temperature range of approximately fifty degrees. Dielectric spectroscopy also enabled the distinction of two orientational relaxation processes: the first due to rotation of the side mesogenic groups, and the second associated with motion of the main chain segments."
237,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,paper_abstract,"Deep hashing methods have demonstrated great retrieval accuracy and efficiency in large-scale image retrieval. Optimizing discrete hash bits remains a key focus in deep hashing methods. A common strategy in these methods is to adopt an activation function, e.g. $\operatorname{sigmoid}(\cdot)$ or $\operatorname{tanh}(\cdot)$, and minimize a quantization loss to approximate discrete values. However, this paradigm may cause more and more hash bits to become stuck in the wrong saturated area of the activation functions and never escape. We refer to this issue as the ""dead bits problem~(dbp)"". Furthermore, the existing quantization loss can also exacerbate dbp. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective gradient amplifier that acts before activation functions to alleviate dbp."

The former is constrained by disappearing charged track searches at the LHC and by dark matter direct detection experiments, while the latter is constrained by existing multilepton collider searches. We find that a two-step electroweak phase transition involving a stable triplet with a negative quadratic term is ruled out by direct detection searches, while an unstable triplet with a mass below $230\ \mathrm{GeV}$ is excluded at a $95\%$ confidence level."

The standard scenario posits an initially circular and narrow belt of planetesimals at semi-major axis $a$, whose eccentricity is increased to $e_f$ after the gas disc has dispersed by secular perturbations from an eccentric planet, resulting in a belt of width $2ae_f$. In a minor modification of this scenario, narrower belts can arise if the planetesimals are initially eccentric, which could result from earlier planetary perturbations during the gas-rich protoplanetary disc phase. However, a primordial eccentricity could alternatively be caused by instabilities that increase the disc's eccentricity, without the need for any planets."

Here, we report on measurements of many-body modes in 1D gated-wires using a tunnelling spectroscopy technique. We observe two separate Fermi seas at high energies, associated with spin and charge excitations, along with the emergence of three additional 1D 'replica' modes that strengthen as the wire length decreases.

In this paper, we identify a surprising consequence of popularity-based rankings: the fewer the items reporting a given signal, the higher the share of overall traffic they collectively attract. This few-get-richer effect emerges in settings where there are few distinct categories of items (e.g., left-leaning news sources versus right-leaning news sources), and items are ranked based on their popularity. We demonstrate analytically that the few-get-richer effect emerges when people tend to click on top-ranked items and have diverse preferences for the categories of items. Using simulations, we analyze how the strength of the effect changes with assumptions about the setting and human behavior.

To address this issue, we introduce a new sparsity dimension, namely pattern-based sparsity, which comprises pattern and connectivity sparsity, and achieves both high accuracy and hardware friendliness. With carefully designed patterns, the proposed pruning method consistently achieves accuracy enhancement and better feature extraction ability on different DNN structures and datasets. Our pattern-aware pruning framework also achieves pattern library extraction, pattern selection, pattern and connectivity pruning, and weight training simultaneously. Our approach on the new pattern-based sparsity naturally fits into compiler optimization for highly efficient DNN execution on mobile platforms."

I want to know the people behind my dinner choices and how I impact them. I want to know how they impact me and why they fish. I want to know how they rely on the water's bounty for their livelihood. Understanding all of this enables us to shift our perception of seafood away from a commodity to an opportunity to restore our ecosystem. It allows us to celebrate the seafood we're fortunate to eat. So, what do we call this? I think we call it restorative seafood. Where sustainability is the capacity to endure and maintain, restorative is the ability to replenish and make progress."

So striking is his body of work that it gave rise to its own adjective. But what are the features of Dickens's writing that make it so distinctive? Dickens's fiction brims with anticipation through atmospheric settings, intricate plot twists, and intriguing mysteries. These features of his work kept his audience eagerly wanting more. When first published, his stories were serialized, meaning they were released in installments a few chapters at a time in affordable literary journals and only later reprinted as books."

Here we were, watching these incredible athletes, the goals were breathtaking, the games were clean and engaging, and at the same time, outside the field, these women were advocating for equal pay, and in the case of some countries, any compensation at all for their sport. So because we were mildly obsessed, we wanted to watch the games live, and we decided that one of the Spanish-language networks in the US was the best place for us to start.

The Yap don't actually move these Rai stones around or exchange them as we do with our coins, since Rai stones can be enormous. The largest weighs about four tons and measures 12 feet across. So, the Yap simply keep track of who owns part of which stone. There's a story about sailors transporting a stone across the ocean when they encountered trouble, and the stone actually fell in."

If you insist that you’re innocent anyway, you’ll likely be found guilty and face execution. But if you confess, apologize, and implicate others for good measure, you’ll be set free. Do you give a false confession— or risk a public hanging? This was the choice facing those accused of witchcraft in the village of Salem, Massachusetts, between February 1692 and May 1693. They were the victims of paranoia about the supernatural, misdirected fervor, and a justice system that valued repentance over truth. Salem was settled in 1626 by English Puritans, a group of strict Protestants. Life was strict and isolated for the people of Salem, with frequent battles against their Native American neighbors and groups of French settlers."

Unfortunately, there aren’t nearly enough donor organs available to meet that demand. What if, instead of waiting, we could create brand-new, customized organs from scratch? That’s the idea behind bioprinting, a branch of regenerative medicine currently in development. We’re not yet able to print complex organs, but simpler tissues, including blood vessels and tubes responsible for nutrient and waste exchange, are already within our grasp. Bioprinting is a biological cousin of 3D printing, a technique that deposits layers of material on top of each other to construct a three-dimensional object one layer at a time."

On top of that, those are the places from which trouble often originates. So we have an ironic problem — good teachers don't want to go to just those places where they're needed most.

And I ask my students these two questions, then share how I answer them, which is in these three sentences that go: I am the daughter of black writers, who are descended from freedom fighters who broke their chains and changed the world.

Sputnik was not actually the first piece of human technology to enter space. That distinction belongs to the V-2 rocket used by Germany in missile attacks against Allied cities as a last-ditch effort in the final years of World War II.

From my experience and that of the women around me, I can attest that it's draining. It's draining to discreetly take out a brown paper bag hiding a pad, stuffing it into your pocket in the middle of a class and rushing to the washroom as quietly as possible. It's draining to sit through lessons and meetings pretending to be absolutely normal, while internally crying out from intense period cramps."

Unfortunately, when I visited, I couldn't find one, but the antlers serve as proof. Across the boreal, we're blessed with an incredible abundance of wetlands.

His skin was covered in painful scabs, and he wondered why he alone had been afflicted with this condition.

And at the time, there wasn't really much information about the company, but the little that was available was truly impressive. Essentially, what the company was doing was developing a medical device where you would be able to run your entire blood panel on a finger-stick of blood. So you wouldn't have to undergo a venipuncture in order to get your blood test done. So this was interesting not only because it was less painful, but also, it could potentially open the door to predictive diagnostics."

And in this community, we didn't have a television; we didn't have computers, obviously, or radio. We didn't even have a telephone. All of my time was spent outside with the Inuit, playing and learning. The snow and the ice were my playground, and the Inuit were my mentors.

That's our role: contain them, control them. Over the years, as a prison system, as a nation, and as a society, we've become very skilled at that, but that shouldn't bring you joy.

In order to do that, I need to explain something about the origin of the solar system. When we go back four and a half billion years, a cloud of gas and dust existed. In the center of this cloud, our sun formed and ignited. Along with that, what we now know as planets, comets, and asteroids formed. What then happened, according to theory, is that when the earth had cooled down a bit after its formation, comets massively impacted the earth, delivering water to earth. They probably also delivered complex organic material to earth, which may have bootstrapped the emergence of life."

President Theodore Roosevelt slept beneath a grove of towering sequoia trees, camped through a snowstorm, and spent hours conversing around the campfire with his host and guide, renowned conservationist John Muir. Roosevelt was famously enamored with the outdoors, but Muir had invited him for more than just a camping excursion: Yosemite was in peril. Although Yosemite had been designated as protected land in 1864, the valley remained vulnerable to overdevelopment in 1903. It was at the heart of a decades-old struggle to balance preservation and public use – two goals that were far easier to articulate than achieve. The battle over Yosemite's fate began with the 1849 gold rush, when miners surged westward, seeking gold in the Sierra Nevada foothills."

As a novice journalist, I sought to present it in a unique way to maximize its impact, given that everyone was aware of the issue yet it persisted. I decided to go undercover, posing as a seller, and in doing so, I gathered concrete evidence. The impact was significant. It was fantastic. This approach is often referred to as immersion or undercover journalism. I had just come out of college, then I got a scoop. The scoop was a very simple story. Police officers were taking bribes from hawkers who were hawking on the streets. As a young reporter, I thought that I should do it in a different way, so that it has a maximum impact, since everybody knew that it was happening, and yet there was nothing that was keeping it out of the system. As part of selling, I was able to document the hard core evidence."

There can be a disconnect between broad, attention-grabbing headlines and the often specific, incremental results of the medical research they cover. So, how can you avoid being misled by catchy headlines? The best way to assess a headline's credibility is to look at the original research it reports on.

The experiment asks us to consider a world in which scientists have developed a machine that would simulate real life while guaranteeing experiences of only pleasure and never pain. The catch: you have to permanently leave reality behind, but you'll hardly notice the difference. Your experiences will be indistinguishable from reality.

Carbon operates in a natural cycle, present in all living things: in the soil, in the oceans, in the atmosphere, and in rocks deep underground. When plants and other living things die, much of their stored carbon returns to the atmosphere until new plants grow and reabsorb it. However, over millions of years, some of the carbon stored in ancient trees and sea life transforms into rock and some becomes fossil fuels: coal, oil, and natural gas. Natural events, such as volcanic eruptions, release some of the carbon trapped in rock. Meanwhile, human activities, like burning fossil fuels, also release some of that prehistoric carbon. Today, humans release approximately 60 times more carbon than all the volcanoes on the planet each year."

Yet one of the greatest differences between natural and human technologies lies in robustness. Robust systems remain stable in complex and unfamiliar environments. Remarkably, cockroaches can self-stabilize while running over rough terrain. When we equip them with a jet pack or subject them to a perturbation like an earthquake, we discovered that their wonderfully tuned legs enable them to self-stabilize without utilizing any brainpower. They can navigate complex terrain, such as grass, with ease and remain stable. We discovered a new behavior where, due to their shape, they automatically roll onto their side to pass through this artificial test section of grass. Robust systems can perform multiple tasks with the same structure. Here's a newly discovered behavior we've found."
