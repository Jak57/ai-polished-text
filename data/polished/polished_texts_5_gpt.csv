1,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,blog,"Another week just flew by. I drove by the new house yesterday, and the front window was covered in boxes. We may get the keys at closing; I am getting so excited. If all goes well this week, we will be set for closing a week from Wednesday. I was up until after 3:00 a.m. last night watching movies with Bethany. There has been a lot of movie watching going on around here lately. Here's my rundown: last night we watched *Thirteen,* a movie every mother of a teen should see. It was better than I expected. Then we watched *Gigli*; yeah, it was just as bad as the media said it was, but we had to see for ourselves."
2,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,blog,"Summer TV in the summer used to be a dead zone full of repeats. But now there are two great new shows on TV and I have been watching both religiously for the last week. Blow Out has the gayest concept ever that seemingly has zero gay people in sight. Hairstylist Jonathan Antin wants to build a second location for his incredibly popular West Hollywood salon, this time in Beverly Hills. Normally no one would care, certainly not I, but as I was flipping through the channels I caught a glimpse of Jonathan, equally narcissistic and dull, looking at an empty space on Rodeo Drive, speaking (in a public voice) 'I am going to build here the greatest salon in the history of the world ever!' and I was hooked. Not since Rocco have I found such a moron compelling TV watching."
3,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,blog,"What a week ... My right shoulder has tendinitis. It's right under my shoulder blade. So, when I move my arm too much, mainly with a mouse on a computer ... It kills me. I can't move it much now because I was on a spree updating my website and working on other online tasks. I can barely gather strength to draw anything. Lack of sleep adds to my pain. I'm not too happy right now, but I'll get better. My mom's surgery went okay. Her eyesight has come back somewhat. She can see fuzzy shapes and make out colors. Other than that, she's still blind as all sin. Hopefully she'll fully regain her vision soon."
4,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,blog,"Kindness of strangers... Attempted laundry today with the kids in tow and realized how quickly the simplest things can become a daunting ordeal. I also learned how remarkably sweet complete strangers can be for no reason other than because they feel like being kind. Trust me. It wasn't like they were trying to get into my pants or anything. I had kid drool all over me and was wearing my 'wash-day' outfit... Also, I'm not super sure I'll ever be bathing again, so it's not like there was even an olfactory incentive there! I am doing two things right now. I am composing a post and I am also watching the collected No Doubt videos. I am doing both of these things sitting at my desk in my room."
5,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,blog,"So it is 11:14pm MST, and here I sit in my bedroom repairing the personal computer of the personnel director from my job. Not that I mind doing it, but I wonder sometimes how often I find myself fixing someone else's computer as a favor. I'm glad to be able to love and support people this way, but where is the line drawn when it comes to the point that you are being taken advantage of? The last couple of weeks, I've been staying up late reading and such, so I was looking forward to hitting the sack early, until I realized it would be more prudent to get this computer out of my bedroom and back into its owner's hands. *laugh* No rest for the weary, right? So I found myself watching Joe Schmo 2 again tonight."
6,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,blog,"Remind me, what did I write about before this? Or, a continuation in the 'is this a date?' saga. So, after the weird lunch, my confidence shook, I forgot to tell you guys an important piece of the story. Before Pat shows up to lunch, Dustin starts talking about what a nice guy Pat is and how he's trying to find a girlfriend for him. I'm listening and nodding and realizing that we're talking more about finding Dustin's best friend a girl, than discussing whatever it is you discuss with a stranger over pink lemonade. I excused myself to the bathroom, looked in the mirror and then silently asked myself: am I being pawned off to the other guy? Is this what happens now?"
7,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,blog,"I would like everyone to think before they act. Actually, I'd like each and every single person in the world to think before they get out of bed in the morning, and make a commitment to keep thinking all day, and if they're not prepared to, I'd like very much that they hop the fuck back in bed, and drift off to an eternal slumber. I'm sick to death of stupid people. No, I'm not the smartest person in the world... But I'm not talking about things that take a lot of brain power, so I think it's fair to criticize the inanely stupid. Let's see if I can keep this particular rant to a few specific types, and we'll save some for another day, sound good? Great."
8,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,blog,"Two problems with the scenario outlined in my previous post: 1. True, Bush is stimulating the economy, but in the wrong way. Robert Rubin told NPR's Marketplace today that Bush could have achieved the same stimulus effect without the long-term debt hangover by enacting different tax cuts, temporary tax cuts that would benefit low and middle-income individuals. Ah, Robert Rubin. The sound of his name is music to our ears. Quick: name one Bush administration cabinet official on the domestic side with Rubin's gravitas. Still thinking? It'll come to you... 2. We can't give the Republicans control only in wartime because they've ingeniously concocted an endless, global 'war on terrorism.'"

Like you're sitting in math class bored out of your skull, and you wonder what exactly goes on in your brain that makes you understand math? And you realize that you exist and you are in math class and you wonder why. Then you realize how amazing existing is. And suddenly it hits you—the fact that you are going off on this random train of thought is incredibly pathetic. Ever had that happen? I hate that. You know what else I hate? Block schedules. Who would ever come up with that idea? Anyone can see that sitting through a two and a half hour class in any subject is cruel and unusual punishment."

Tonight Andy beat me by a few small dollars and won the freakin' game, or maybe I let him win on account of him leaving in a few short hours and me wanting him to feel good on his last night here. Well however the story goes it can't compare to this Texas-sized headache I have at the moment, I've taken some Aleve and I must say that they are doing the trick, all I need now is some well-deserved r&r your telephone's the one that helped me wrap the cord around your neck...

12,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,blog,"Well... Today has been a long day. We had to drive home from Indiana. I guess I'm gonna have to be choosy about what I write because I could really take up a lot of time and space, and I just don't have enough energy. First off, I have to say that camp was awesome and even better than I could have expected. God has been doing so much in my life lately, and it's just awesome. I've sort of turned over a new leaf, I guess, but anyway, back to the beginning. We arrived at the Twiggs' house on Friday evening and stayed until we left for camp on Monday. Most of what we did was go to the fair, church, a parade, Walmart, and watch movies."

I'm definitely nervous, scared, jittery, and any other words you can think of for 'no way, I really don't want to go' to school. This is going to be a whole new ball game for me. As a perfectionist, I love excelling at everything I do. But starting new things is tough.

14,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,blog,"Arun Shourie discusses how the current governor of Uttar Pradesh had warned, as far back as 1996, about the impending threat of the rise of a 'third Islamic state' in the subcontinent. T. V. Rajeswar, the former head of the Intelligence Bureau and the present governor of Uttar Pradesh, had predicted this dire threat in a series of articles published in The Hindustan Times, in 1996. Shourie raises a valid point when he says, does the fact that you now know that he, and not I, to say nothing of Mr. Advani, wrote all that make the warnings ring true? Or do you conclude that because he wrote in this refrain, T. V. Rajeswar is a closet communalist who should not be allowed to continue as governor of Uttar Pradesh?"

It has been a long, hard day in the trenches here today, folks, with almost no time to write anything for you readers. However, it's good to see Tigger (now Akcron) taking up the reins herself and making an appearance and talking about things :) not much to add about things. Yesterday was Shakespeare on the Green, which was a lovely play, but I had to leave before the closing curtain, which kinda sucked. Hopefully, someday I'll see the entirety of a Shakespeare play. But I digress. Akcron is right about the problems with the shower; it sucks. In terms of laughing at her in the shower, you have to admit, the look people get when committing self-torture can be pretty entertaining."
16,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,blog,"All of a sudden, for the past two days, I have been overcome with terrible bouts of exhaustion. Bone-deep exhaustion. Last evening, I went home and just slept off, only getting up when my mother called me around eight thirty. When I woke up, it was all dark and I hadn't switched the lights on, so I could not figure out what time or date it was. For a few seconds, it was just my mother's voice in the darkness and me grappling with reality. Wonder why I'm feeling so drained... Nice weather this morning. It was drizzling when I came. Although in Calcutta, I hear it's been raining for the past three days."
17,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,blog,"Last night was the worst. I threw away the sweater I was knitting. I only had about 14 inches. I lost probably $10 worth of yarn (it's $8 a skein). But it had too many stitches by the time I got to the armholes, and the mohair was knotting itself together as I knitted, so frogging (ripping out rows) didn’t work well. The yarn broke a lot. I didn’t even swear, which is unusual for me. I just morosely ripped and listened to season two of Sex and the City (way to go, library!). And then I got sick of it and threw it away. I suppose I could say I learned a lot while trying to do this sweater."
18,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,blog,"Last night in class, we were discussing that week’s assigned reading, ""Getting Back into Place: Toward a Renewed Study of the Place-World,"" by Edward S. Casey. The first chapter deals with “implacement” and the second, “displacement.” In the first chapter, Casey makes the distinction that our contemporary world and culture revolve around time as the situating force: we are running out of time, we have saved time, we are just in time. He is trying to make the case that using place as the center of culture creates a more grounded community. (That is a very rough summation, a disclaimer just in case my professor or any other classmate happens to read this post.) So far, this book is the first reading that has grabbed me by the proverbial shoulders."

And while giggling is good, one wonders if we would have found ourselves up that fire escape drinking beer in the fierce wind had we not been eating them earlier. Finding ourselves in a doorway to a bar sadly closed for business, we stopped to examine an office-supplies catalog that had arrived in the post. Lucky we did. Who could possibly have guessed that within these pages were the special offers of a lifetime? not I, for certain. I list but a few: buy 36 permanent marker pens, get a stunt kite.

Senate Republicans okay, hands up - who watched the 39-hour judicial nominations wankathon last week? I know I didn't. Well, okay - I did tune in once or twice. The entire colossal waste of time was perpetrated by Republicans who, upset that Democrats wouldn't concede and nominate four of Bush's extreme justices, were trying to score political points by holding a multi-day cry-fest. Never mind the fact that the Democrats have already approved 168 of Bush's judicial nominees - nooo, that's not good enough for the power-mad Republicans who are inexplicably laboring under the misapprehension they have a huge mandate for this kind of nonsense."
21,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,blog,"This was a good weekend. I enjoyed a lot of god's green leaf, after a long time, I listened to a lot of Nevermore (something I should have started doing much earlier) and read extensively. I finished three books over the weekend - Bruce Sterling's Heavy Weather, Larry Niven's World of Ptavvs, and Octavia Butler's Parable of the Sower. Heavy Weather was a good cyberpunk romp through a near-future USA, devastated by global warming and general anarchy. While it was clever, well-paced, and altogether very convincing, I must confess that I failed to come away with any truly significant sensations about the story or the characters. Not that both aren't well constructed and vividly etched - it's a good book, but not a great one, I guess."
22,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,blog,"Because this is the aftermath, the first week back from practicum was a struggle, but it is only in the second week that the smoke has really started to clear. Post-practicum trauma was a hidden epidemic that is only now coming to light. I was stricken, but the eventual meeting with the course coordinator allowed me to release my burden, and by doing so I have prevented another person from being stuck with such a pedagogically deficit practicum school. Yesterday (Monday), I bumped into another aggrieved classmate who was quite determined to go to the student who was due to go to her school in the next practicum and tell him how terrible it would be. I calmed her down and said that we should go to the administrator first."

I've found that I really suck at 8-ball and ping pong! Rick (the Canuck) beats me on a regular basis - we have a ping pong table in the front lobby of our building, always time for a 'quick round'. Last night I participated in an 8-ball tournament over at the hot spot (our recreation tent - complete with popcorn machine, numerous TVs, jukebox, DVD rental, pool table, dart board, and ever-present ping pong table). Anyway, I was doing pretty well throughout my one entire game - until I scratched on the eight ball ;( I still had a fairly good time - the most fun was the two Dutch soldiers that joined in the tournament."

I was not then nor am I now a math person. I hate math. I am math phobic. You get the picture. So as I struggled to make sense out of algebra, the doorbell rang. I put down my book and went to open the door. No one was there. Great. I returned to my studies and just as I was finding a little glimmer of understanding buried in my subconscious, the doorbell rang again. Bam, just like that my breakthrough disappeared. I went to the door and once again no one was there. Just what a struggling math student needs, an uninvited practical joker."

The new room is bigger and closer to my grade level team; these are the things I need to consider as I spend hours upon hours preparing my room for this year. Had I known I was going to move prior to the end of my school year, I would have discarded many of the books and supplies I no longer use. Unfortunately, it all came with me. So this week was spent moving, unpacking, and purging extensively. I have to thank my teammate Jill for helping with all of this. You see, she was still teaching this month, in my old room. So she and her wonderful students moved almost my entire room for me!"

Forever will I always be reminded of the very few nights we spent together, hearts and limbs entwined in a soul-embrace, drenched in the salty darkness of an evening by the beach ...

Or let me rephrase that, the article I'm doing and its consequences are not exactly something I'm comfortable with.

I've grown up in a country where you don't ask questions. Really, you just don't. They shoot you for that. They put you in jail with all these internal security acts.

It was a 30-minute or so walk. We were all catching our breath. Whew! But we made it. The water was icy cold. You could feel your body getting numb from the cold. We only stayed less than an hour because we headed for the nearby waterfalls. Another 30 minutes of trekking. But the trip was worth it because the falls looked calming and the whole scene was indeed breathtaking. It's like you could hear yourself being one with nature. Soaking myself in the cold water felt like communing with Mother Earth. The cold air and water were enough to lull you to sleep."

Sunday morning, when he woke up, he was so excited that the Easter Bunny had come. There is nothing better than to see the excitement on your child's face. After egg hunting, we all went to church. Even though the 'Easter Bunny' is fun and all, we make sure our kids know the true meaning of the holidays.

By Gary Fineout and Alfonso Chardy, the citizenship ceremony in Jacksonville seemed to go off as usual, with a crowd of nearly 200 people going home as new Americans. Just before the new citizens left the June 29 event, an immigration official directing the swearing-in urged them to stop by a voter registration table—a not uncommon sight at naturalization ceremonies. But this table was unusual: those handing out forms were Republican volunteers—and the party affiliation box had been checked off ahead of time to make all of the new voters members of the GOP. All of it was suspicious to Linda Cross, who was there to watch her husband, Dario Cruz, take his citizenship oath."

As a non-American blogger I've been a little reluctant to get involved in some of these discussions, particularly the bits about flags, but since I started it (the subject, not the flag-burning) I suppose I'd better say something. Firstly, I think that the idea of having a law against flag-burning is completely nuts. The moment you start according a symbol - any symbol - that kind of automatic reverence and protection, you've taken a small but important step towards totalitarianism.

Relationship of the delivery point and the use of interruptible transport on the Northwest pipeline. Is the transport upstream or downstream of the delivery point? If downstream, why isn't it being contracted for by EWEB? 2. What volume is being sold each day? You use the term DCQ and you also talk about a 20% tolerance above or below the estimated quantity. Normally, there would be no tolerance with a DCQ transaction. 3. Is this envisioned to be a requirements transaction? Is the price the same for volumes in excess of the estimated quantity up to an additional 20%?"

97,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"Magic fans beware... Wizards is hesitant to create a decent digital game. At its core, Magic: The Gathering is a social game. A game to enjoy with your friends (or frenemies) laughing, talking smack, and dropping game-winning bombs. Wizards of the Coast seems to have forgotten this. If you choose to play with friends, you can’t earn gold, and gold is important. Gold is so important that they have implemented a daily cap, understandable considering gold unlocks everything in-game. But get ready for a long and boring 1v1 grind against the computer or random opponents, whom you can't even speak to.

98,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"Being the third installment in the trilogy, I'll address the negative aspects first. I quite dislike prequels, as they technically take the story backward instead of forward (this is an issue for every prequel). Granted, it offers more storywise. The combat feels sloppy and doesn't seem as sharp as Arkham City managed to make it. As of writing this recommendation (26/10/2013), there is a game-breaking bug that stops a side mission from ever being completed (main story not affected). Some gadgets are assigned a ridiculous hotkey that requires your hand to travel across the entire keyboard to reach it. It might sound like nothing, but during combat, it could potentially break your combo."
99,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"They essentially fixed Shadow Warrior (2013); the boss fights are awesome, weapons feel very nice (maybe not as good as D44M's, but still solid), and enemies aren't too spongy (if you're competent with handling elemental and upgrade features). The upgrade system is quite balanced, and once you get the hang of it, it's not too tedious. The elemental features and limited ammo subtly encourage you to use different weapons. There are lots of cool, unique (being the key word here when comparing SW2 to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Borderlands' formula of 'RNG' weapons) weapons that remain viable through most of the game. The music is great, especially the main theme, and of course Stan Bush's work."
100,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"So many things were done wrong. I don't even know how to start this review. This all pertains to my career. My player is an outside scorer, PG, 1.71m, has maxed stats and already got all necessary perks. Ok, and now tell me, why does shooting skill depend on a person's height? Why can't a person who is 1.74m become as good in shooting as someone who is 1.71m? I'm 1.87m in real life, made my first player with this height and noticed I can't reach a higher skill than 89. Why? That's pure discrimination! And why does the game not tell me that before I create a character and not even when I reach the skill limit after weeks of playing?!?"
101,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"I think this Assassin's Creed nailed the mechanics on all fronts (ship battles, sailing, hunting (fish), parkour, etc). I felt much more attached to this character as well. The story starts out extremely rough but does get much better as you play (I think this is with every AC game personally). Edward was quite the interesting character and so were all the side characters. I felt like all the collectibles actually meant something in this AC game that I never got from any of the previous ones and maybe it's because I felt like they had a bigger purpose in the game. They definitely were not required but they were fun to collect and you were rewarded in a very balanced way."
102,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"While I personally cannot recommend this game, it wasn't absolutely terrible. The gunplay is decent, so long as you have the money to purchase gun parts, which would be my main complaint with this game: it's pay-to-win. If I could get past that, the game would be enjoyable, as the hardsuit is fun to use and HRV is an excellent idea. I'd take this game over any Call of Duty title any day, but its pay-to-win microtransaction format is off-putting for me. If you are okay with this model, then by all means, have fun. But if you're like me and dislike pay-to-win games, just let this one slide; it's not our cup of tea."
103,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"While not perfect, this game has been greatly enjoyable. The save system and possibility of sudden death lead to some frustration. I'm on my first playthrough and I lost my main character around hour 10 of 20ish. Would have really liked a save to reload at that point. I've since picked up a 3rd party mod/save tool to avoid catastrophic failures. Plus, the aiming reticule is on the small side and zoom is underpowered. With all that said, it's been a blast. I'm not normally a zombie fan, but the combination of strategy, missions, first person shooter/beat 'em up is great. I've been playing it as often as I can get away... Just one more mission, just one more supply run—or I'm running away and want to get safe before shutting the game down."
104,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"An absolutely great strategy game! Having played every single other wargame (European Escalation and ALB), I have to say this one fits well. The number of units is great. Not sure exactly how many units there are, but there's a ton! Graphics are just beautiful, sounds are great, and the gameplay overall is epic. The in-game chat box at the main menu is very entertaining as well, no I am not kidding. However, if anyone thinks this game is 'easy', or if you are new to the strategy genre, it could take you quite some time to get it nailed down. Do not get upset, you will lose a lot of units. Just make sure you plan ahead, always have anti-air and anti-tank."
105,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"I was negatively biased towards this game before I played it. Wasn't even sure about buying. I dunno, the whole portal gun and portals thing seemed weird to me even though I like science fiction. Boy was I wrong. The jokes and voice acting in this game is phenomenal. Just amazing. It's not cheesy (ok it's sometimes cheesy). And different story characters have all their own sense of humor. Those different characters do really have different personalities. And the level design; it's just rad. Btw I never played the first portal game. One of these days, I'm planning to if I can spare the time. I would never have played it if I hadn't played the sequel."
106,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"OK, let's start on the pros (+) and cons (-) then my thoughts on this game. +Some of the best characters +Good story +Loads of content +Customizable character (you can be male or female, whatever you like) +You can have a relationship with most of your companions (yes fangirls, you can have a love interest) -Bad graphics (I don't think graphics really matter anyway) -Weird and awkward love scenes -Invisible walls -There's one mission in my opinion that was boring, but everyone has different tastes -+ Um, this isn't really bad or good, but for those who care, your protagonist you made can't talk. Okay, now for my thoughts. I love this game. This game is probably one of the best RPGs or games in general I have ever played. So if you're an RPG fan, you probably already have this game."
107,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"Yes, this is a nostalgia trip for thirty-somethings who remember (at least in the UK) watching the ever-irritating Timmy Mallett just for the five-minute Transformers cartoon. The voice actors for Optimus, Megatron, Bumblebee, and many others are back, and instantly recognizable. The distinctive cartoon transformation sound is there. Graphically, the cel-shaded presentation is perfect, and very, very Generation One. But aside from that, it's actually a very fun game. The combat mechanics are extremely well done. Transforming mid-fight is often a necessity, and woven seamlessly into combos, making it quite unlike High Moon's excellent War for/Fall of Cybertron games. Another distinction is the heavy focus on melee combat, but some enemies (e.g. Seekers) require a switch to a ranged blaster."
108,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"I downloaded the game and played it for a little while, and it was nothing special. I spent more time trying to log in than actually playing the game. There is a bug where it says that there was an update to the terms of service or whatever and whenever you click 'accept,' it just pops up again. You have to restart the client for it to work. Now that isn't so bad, but why do I need to link my Steam and Gface accounts? They say it is for DLC, but why is that even necessary? It is also not reversible, so now I know that a company I don't care about has access to my Steam information. Now, the game itself is so-so. It is easily recognizable as a CoD clone, except somehow they made the gunplay worse... How is that even possible?"

110,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"I experienced no performance problems even at release, and after all these patches it plays very well. In my opinion, this is a really great and fun game overall, although the format may be somewhat annoying (where the free-roam city area repopulates with new enemies every time you progress the story). I particularly enjoyed the 'dual play' segments (where you can play as Batman + 1 more), and the ability to use the controller for most segments of the game but switch to the mouse and keyboard for the tank combat segments was greatly appreciated. Driving your Batmobile around the free-roam city, including when chasing the APC commanders, is actually quite enjoyable once you figure out how to use the brakes to skid around corners (and when you master that, driving around the city is really quite enjoyable!)"
111,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"Damn fine AAA FPS shooter - that's the bottom line. It looks, sounds, and plays great - excellent FPS mechanics, nice story, cool characters, flawless voice acting, and a badass soundtrack. Not for the faint-hearted though - some of those cutscenes were pretty darn cruel and vivid. But when a game overall is so great, it's easier to spot the flaws, and here they are as I saw them: - no SLI support - what's up with that? I had to put the game away until I upgraded my card, as it ran too poorly on my old dual GPU GTX 590. Make sure you have a fairly decent single GPU card. - Stupidly small obstacles are often unclimbable."

I will break down this review into a few categories: - graphics - controls - sound - gameplay - replayability. - Graphics: The game is set in a comic-like style. The graphics are very sleek: no unnecessary details. Nice color schemes. It totally works for this game. The graphics can be set on 'high' without stressing your system. I run this game on an i5 Pentium processor with an NVIDIA GeForce 710M card, 8GB memory, and it runs like clockwork (Windows 8.1). - Controls: The game can be played with keyboard and mouse, but also with an Xbox controller."
113,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"You can see by the hours I put into this game that I enjoy it. This is everything I wished a search game from CoD would be. But don't buy this game thinking it's like CoD, Battlefield, or any other shooter game. It's a game in its own class and should be treated as such. Can't tell you how many times I hear new players ♥♥♥♥♥ and complain about getting killed really fast. Oh god forbid you get shot in the face and ♥♥♥♥ing die. It's not like that doesn’t happen in real life or anything. Edit: Okay, so I've been playing this game for a while now. Thrown all kinds of money at it. One of the best MP games around. A good thing to play when you're not feeling CS:GO."
114,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"I'm 2 hours in and am dying from this game. So funny. Gameplay is also solid, art design is beautiful, music is surprisingly high quality and appropriate, the story/world has me interested, and the puzzles are fun. But the best aspect of this game beyond all that is the comedy. If you've played any RPG since the dawn of video game RPGs, you will laugh at the various jokes, parodies, and references; if you've never played an RPG before, you should still enjoy the game for its humor. If you played Final Fantasy 7 or X, you absolutely need to play this game; without giving too much away... I had to actually stop playing after 2 hours to give my cheeks a break from laughing and smiling so much. What a delight so far."
115,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"I'm really sorry, I try to be supportive of free-to-play games and indie developers, but I really didn't enjoy this game. The description sounded right up my alley, but the execution did nothing for me. I love puzzle and exploration games, but I found this game to be completely unintuitive, and even after looking up how to progress, I still just didn't find the gameplay itself fun. It also completely lacks a pause button, or if it does have one, I never found it. Considering that a lot of sequences in the game are timed, this seems like a critical oversight. I also feel like this game is a lot more cutscene than it is game, and I end up just sitting around drumming my fingers a lot."
116,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"This game.... Phew where to even start. It was absolutely beautiful; from story to graphics I was hooked. The story wasn't just some story but actually felt like I was that person, trying to figure out what came next in the story that my character was telling. Gameplay was great and I learned a lot about myself through this game (mainly my fear of heights which I never had a problem with until the ice caverns). My gut churned the whole time, but I pushed through for Uncle Fred! If you guys made a DLC or second game, I would be the first to buy it and recommend it to everyone I know. Thanks to everyone who was involved in making this; you made an absolutely beautiful game."
117,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"Sid Meier's Civilization Beyond Earth is a turn-based game where you build your civilization to a certain goal or 'victory.' In previous games, you were set on Earth's timeline, going through periods like the Stone Age, Medieval Age, and the Modern Age; however, in this game, you are set in the future on a mission to colonize a new planet. What I enjoy about this game is that 2K took a new approach to the game and added some new mechanics, such as the affinity system and orbital layer. What I didn't enjoy was that with these new mechanics, the game could be overwhelming at times. What I think could be improved in this game is the incorporation of new artwork, such as the environment you experience when communicating with another leader."
118,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"Great game! Tons of replayability and very fun zombie survival game! Definitely in my top 5 zombie games ever played. Edit: after playing 60+ hours I can honestly say this is one of the better, more ""realistic"" zombie games. It's very much designed like a survival horror as you must save up your ammo, heal your own wounds when you bleed out, take pills when you're infected, etc. Also, I find zombies to feel very natural, and to be well animated for a free-to-play game. P.S.: I would recommend getting 1 or 2 friends to play with, but the community is super friendly, and you can usually make friends/talk with people in the chat or over voice comms."
119,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"02/07/2014 - it's a shame I can't fully recommend/enjoy this game, as from the short time I've played it, I know I'd be addicted if it didn't have the following two game breakers. No Aussie servers - one red bar puts you at a severe disadvantage and creates unbearable lag. Mind you, I played through the offline training mode and it was stuttering/lagging as well (how does that even happen?). Couple that with the poor ping, and it just ruins the game. Everything artifacts like crazy - the menus, backgrounds, training, and in-game. I've never had this happen before with this card and thought it might not like my oc. Set my GPU back to stock and sure enough, it didn't make a difference."
120,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"Very late last night, I finished this. The story is not very deep or interesting, but what makes it stand out is the storytelling. The atmosphere is filled to the brim, and the many collectibles do a great job at fleshing it out. I did learn a lot about the world of Batman, so it was a little disappointing that so few bosses were in the game. Oh well, there are enough future games to rectify that. The combat is the right amount of challenge, but it's more on the easy side. Leveling up Batman wasn't very satisfying. It's the gadgets you upgrade and acquire during the campaign that add nice new gameplay mechanics. Accessing previously unreachable places makes for a nice sense of progression."
121,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"'To the Moon' is no mere game... Nay, it is a veritable experience, and it was one of the best of my life at that. Think Telltale's The Walking Dead is sad? Hohoho! Well, it's no match for To the Moon! Never before have I been so depressed yet fulfilled over something purely fictional. This masterpiece represents the pinnacle of storytelling in my opinion, and the soundtrack is a gorgeously charming and perfect accompaniment. Yes, the controls are a bit finicky and the gameplay is not the strong point, but the story is so fantastic that I did not care one bit. Plus, the humor of the game is great as well and it definitely does not intrude upon the distinguished nature of the story... And the Doctor Who references are endless."
122,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"Bastion is a bloody brilliant game, with a truly great storyline. Set after some calamity happened, you start to rebuild on the bastion. There's quite a lot of variety in the game, with the choice of what to build to give you an advantage, what weapons to use and what power-ups to have on those weapons as well as what drinks to use to give you a bonus effect. The art style and music in the game are fantastic, everything looks so colorful at times; who says the apocalypse has to be dull? Best of all, the game has narration based on what you, the player, do. So if you end up picking up a weapon then switch it for another in the armory, the narration would mention you taking along the new weapon."
123,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"I had originally bought this game in early development, when the only currency was spacebux, and there was no 'tech tree'. This was when the game was good. All of the guns at this point were equally overpowered, so there were no issues with imbalance; everyone could kill everyone at any time. Also, the game used to give you unlimited gun slots and five loadouts. You would think that for a game with 'bajillions of guns', they would at least give you more than 6 weapon slots and 3 loadouts before you have to pay to get more. At one point, I had about 3 pages worth of guns, and was planning on new ideas for more, because personally, that's where I found it fun."
124,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"This game was a surprising gem. One often sees rave reviews of certain products that are often misleading. In this case, the reviews reflect the fun of this neat little game. It is an odd mix between a classic 2D platformer and a MOBA, and does it with style. I found myself enjoying characters that I wouldn't enjoy in other MOBA games. I had expected this trait to continue, but decided to give a melee tank a go anyway. I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome and ended up trying out more as they were unlocked from playing games. The art style and interface are oddly charming. As such, I now use one of the characters as my avatar and a wallpaper from creating a card set for the game."

It's been a while since a game has had that effect on me. The music sets the mood, the sound effects are spot on, and the controls are perfect. I look forward to every combat encounter, and they've optimized combat extremely well. I had my doubts about the naval combat system, but it is so much fun to lay waste to multiple fleets at a time! The only way to lose in this game is to fail to retreat. If the combat looks overwhelming just get outta there, regroup, and counter-assault. Thanks, devs, for an awesome experience!"
126,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"The reboot of the Devil May Cry franchise has brought about many changes for the series, particularly for the series’ protagonist, Dante. While fans of the original series may be upset at the change to their beloved character, it’s certainly for the better; and this new game by Ninja Theory proves it. DMC serves as the perfect point for newcomers to jump into the series. It shows the origins of an arrogant, cynical Dante, and it chronicles his journey from cynicism to selflessness. Throughout, the game weaves a clear narrative arc for the new Dante, making him a compelling character to watch. The story follows Dante as he’s introduced into the corrupt world he willfully chose to ignore."
127,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"Where do I start on this absolutely beautiful game? Its story is absolutely charming. It has so much detail put into it, and it is a bundle of happiness, bad puns, annoying dogs, and secrets. It is serious when it needs to be but isn't a stranger to funny moments. The character design is on point, with various characters having distinct personalities and secrets. It stands out from other RPGs because you don't have to kill anyone, which is an unused concept in RPGs. With lots of inspiration from EarthBound, one of the best RPGs I have seen, you can tell that it is going to be good. It easily has the best soundtrack I've heard in ages."
128,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"I am recommending this solely because it's free and might be a more 'enjoyable' experience for others. As for my experience, the 'game' did nothing for me. Half the story relies on shock factor. I was neither shocked nor emotionally moved in any way by this. Maybe I'm desensitized, or maybe it was too simple to warrant a reaction from me. As for the other half of the game, it tries to paint a picture (literally) of a person in mental decline. It deals with obsession, hallucination, depression, and a few other things. In theory, it is a cool idea. But the 'game' took me 10 minutes to complete, and that's with reading and absorbing every little bit of information I could."

It is an amazing way to test your mind while still being fun. Although this game isn't as story-heavy, it did give birth to one of the most popular games of 2011. I still play this game and beat it when I am feeling bored, and I love to come back and see what gave birth to a legend and what is a legend. Gameplay: Portal's gameplay is quite simple, to explain at least. You use portals to your advantage, along with buttons that activate a part of the puzzle. Two buttons are in the game, one that you press and one you need a cube to put on."

Divinity: Dragon Commander reaches awfully close to these borders of my personal favorite RTS game. Combine this with a huge Risk-like grand strategy mode and there, it hit the spot. I am not (read: try not to be) overly biased due to the fact that this game allows you to turn into a dragon, aiding your troops by supporting, attacking, and even commanding unit production, direction, and spawning at the very same time. Honestly, I do like the complicated RTS games nowadays. Think of Civ V and so on. However, such games attempt to cram complex mechanics, charts, and resources all into one complicated game mode."

And all of this without touching on the world, characters, story, gameplay... I could write entire pages about it. But instead, I'll just say this: if you like RPGs, play this game. If you like video games, play this game. If you have seven free hours between now and your death, play this game."

I would normally give this game a 10/10, but unfortunately after 1.03, this game turned into buggy ♥♥♥♥ + random crashes, so remember to save quite often. When I played version 1.00 to 1.03, my game never crashed, and I didn't see any bugs. Also, I have noticed that after the 1.03 patch, the drawing distance sometimes is horrible, starting to draw objects when you're really close, sometimes even people. But if you overlook all these bugs, crashes, and draw-distance 'bugs,' this is a really fantastic game. They made a huge effort on quests, some of them really emotional and deep, lots of side quests, and the fact that your decisions affect a lot in this game.

The developers are very active in the community, and it really shows in the various discussion forums and dev diaries. There is a fairly steep learning curve to the game's mechanics, of which I am still trying to learn; however, this breadth of strategy allows you a myriad of ways to reach goals and take advantage of certain situations. The game, in my mind, is almost infinitely replayable. I find myself absorbed into every session I play, regardless of how the play-through is going."

After those few enjoyable hours, you'll begin to see that the only thing the game has to offer is repetition in its combat, enemies, and gameplay. The one major high point is that the developers are working hard and do frequent updates that generally include a lot of content, from sweeping changes to some of the game's systems, to new warframes and other tweaks/features. It's a good game to play casually, though I doubt it will hold your attention beyond a few months unless you just really like grinding. The upside to all of this is that the game is free, so I'd recommend trying it out. If you're looking for a quick fix, try it out."

Sadly, it's far from it. In this game, you go about absorbing progressively larger things to grow and absorb even bigger things. But the gameplay isn't as smooth as it could be, the levels lack inventiveness, and what is present is a surreal horror show. I don't mean an entertaining horror show but, rather, one that makes you feel depressed and question whether being alive is all it should be. Every 'living' creature in this game, from small pets to human beings, makes me wonder if the creators of this game had an interest in taxidermy."

I thought, 'Oh wow! A simulator of the road to becoming president! That sounds fun!' Well, it really wasn't. The game starts you off and says you need to pick a side: Republican or Democrat, there is no independent or third party. A little disappointed but still optimistic, I carried on to see what I could do. I will give the game credit, though; the character customization, although limited, is pretty fun to mess around with.

You don't have to work for power armor; it's essentially given to you at the beginning of the game, and power cores are everywhere in trader shops. The value of power armor has diminished greatly compared to previous Fallout games. The story is mediocre; everything about this game is mediocre, except it doesn't crash every 10 minutes like Fallout 3. It's very stable compared to Fallout 3. Is it better than Fallout 3?

For one thing, I have a Vive and I'm much more interested in playing room-sized games with the controllers. Beyond that, the game is initially awe-inspiring in the scale of its universe, but I also felt that same scale was a hindrance to my enjoyment. The learning curve and the amount of time to do anything interesting at the beginning were both too large for me. Perhaps if I were more patient and had more time for gaming, this would be compelling to me. But I don't have either and there are plenty more VR games I'd rather spend my time on."

Single hits to the chest, neck, or head from rifle-caliber weapons almost always result in death unless it just grazes you. Rounds drop over distance, and short, controlled bursts are required if you wish to remain on target. There is no magical ammunition pool. If you reload half-way through your magazine all the time, then you will have a pouch full of half-full mags. You can't run forever. If you sprint for a while, your aim will suffer as you gasp heavily until you have caught your breath. Rest your weapon on your elbows while prone or on a windowsill to steady your aim. Accuracy suffers when standing."

As for XCOM 2, I love it; the game plays pretty well for me on medium, and I am running a GTX 560 with 2 GB of VRAM. At first, the game set it to high, and it was running a bit sluggishly, but not to the point of being unplayable. When I dropped it down to medium, it smoothed out.

GM, whose own European operations are losing money, no longer wants to own the unprofitable Fiat unit.

It has argued the deal was voided by Fiat's decision to sell off its finance arm and halve GM's stake via a capital-raising effort.

In addition to coaxing ever larger and more tangible objects into a regime of quantum behavior, this new capability has encouraged ideas of using mechanical oscillators in the processing and communication of quantum information and as precision force sensors operating beyond the standard quantum limit. However, the effectively linear interaction between motion and light or electricity precludes access to the broader class of quantum states of motion, such as cat states or energy squeezed states. Indeed, early optomechanical proposals noted the possibility to escape this restriction by creating strong quadratic coupling of motion to light. Although there have been experimental demonstrations of quadratically coupled optomechanical systems, these have not yet accessed nonclassical states of motion."

Unfortunately, the evaluations can be manipulated using fake reviews (""spams"") by professional spammers, who have learned increasingly insidious and powerful spamming strategies by adapting to the deployed detectors. Spamming strategies are hard to capture, as they can vary quickly over time, differ across spammers and target products, and more critically, remain unknown in most cases. Furthermore, most existing detectors focus on detection accuracy, which is not well-aligned with the goal of maintaining the trustworthiness of product evaluations. To address these challenges, we formulate a minimax game where the spammers and spam detectors compete with each other on their practical goals that are not solely based on detection accuracy. Nash equilibria of the game lead to stable detectors that are agnostic to any mixed detection strategies."

To ensure high fidelity, we use the Lewis-Riesenfeld (L-R) method to derive a family of solutions leading to an exact transfer, where the solutions follow a single dynamical mode of the L-R invariant. Among this family, we identify a tracking solution with a single parameter to control simultaneously the fidelity of the transfer, the population of the excited state, and robustness. We define a measure of the robustness of an uh-fidelity transfer as the minimum percentile deviation on the pulse areas at which the infidelity rises above $10^{-4}$. The robustness of our shaped pulses is found superior to that of Gaussian and adiabatically-optimized pulses for moderate pulse areas."

We show that all local minima share the same form of structure that partially identifies the component centers of the true mixture, in the sense that each local minimum involves a non-overlapping combination of fitting multiple Gaussians to a single true component and fitting a single Gaussian to multiple true components. Our results apply to the setting where the true mixture components satisfy a certain separation condition and are valid even when the number of components is over- or under-specified. For Gaussian mixtures with three components, we obtain sharper results in terms of the scaling with the separation between the components."

In reality, due to the exponentially increasing Hilbert space dimension with respect to the system size, it is very challenging to construct an efficient entanglement witness for general multipartite entangled states. For $n$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-like states, the most robust witness scheme requires $n+1$ local measurement settings and can tolerate up to $1/2$ white noise. In comparison, the most efficient witness for GHZ-like states only needs two local measurement settings and can tolerate up to $1/3$ white noise."

The latter can break the axial and equatorial symmetry of the Kerr metric and have a much richer multipolar structure, providing a portal to constrain fuzzball models phenomenologically. We find numerical evidence that all multipole moments are typically larger (in absolute value) than those of a Kerr black hole with the same mass and spin. Current measurements of the quadrupole moment of black-hole candidates could impose only mild constraints on fuzzballs, while future gravitational-wave detections of extreme mass-ratio inspirals with the space mission LISA will improve these bounds by orders of magnitude."

We consider a common scenario in which edges can be short-term interactions (e.g., messaging) or long-term structural connections (e.g., friendship). In practice, long-term edges are often specified by humans. Human-specified edges can be both expensive to produce and suboptimal for the downstream task. To alleviate these issues, we propose a model based on temporal point processes and variational autoencoders that learns to infer temporal attention between nodes by observing node communication. As temporal attention drives between-node feature propagation, using the dynamics of node interactions to learn this key component provides more flexibility while simultaneously avoiding issues associated with human-specified edges."
210,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"Observations of thermally driven transverse vibration of a photonic crystal waveguide (pcw) are reported. The pcw consists of two parallel nanobeams with a 240 nm vacuum gap between the beams. Models are developed and validated for the transduction of beam motion to phase and amplitude modulation of a weak optical probe propagating in a guided mode (gm) of the pcw for probe frequencies far from and near to the dielectric band edge. Since our pcw is designed for near-field atom trapping, this research provides a foundation for evaluating possible deleterious effects of thermal motion on optical atomic traps near the surfaces of pcws. Longer-term goals are to achieve strong atom-mediated links between individual phonons of vibration and single photons propagating in the gms of the pcw, thereby enabling opto-mechanics at the quantum level with atoms, photons, and phonons."
211,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"We establish natural splittings for the values of global Mackey functors at orthogonal, unitary, and symplectic groups. In particular, the restriction homomorphisms between the orthogonal, unitary, and symplectic groups of adjacent dimensions are naturally split epimorphisms. The interest in the splitting originates from equivariant stable homotopy theory. The equivariant stable homotopy groups of every global spectrum form a global Mackey functor, so the splittings imply that certain long exact homotopy group sequences separate into short exact sequences. For the real and complex global Thom spectra $\mathbf{mo}$ and $\mathbf{mu}$, the splittings imply the regularity of various Euler classes related to the tautological representations of $o(n)$ and $u(n)$."
212,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"Baryonic feedback effects lead to a suppression of the weak lensing angular power spectrum on small scales. The poorly constrained shape and amplitude of this suppression are an important source of uncertainties for upcoming cosmological weak lensing surveys such as Euclid or LSST. In this first paper in a series of two, we use simulations to build a Euclid-like tomographic mock dataset for the cosmic shear power spectrum and the corresponding covariance matrix, which are both corrected for baryonic effects following the baryonification method of Schneider et al. (2019). In addition, we develop an emulator to obtain fast predictions of the baryonic power suppression, allowing us to perform a likelihood inference analysis for a standard $\lambda$CDM cosmology with both cosmological and astrophysical parameters."
213,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"Spontaneous conversations in real-world settings, such as those found in child-centered recordings, have been shown to be among the most challenging audio files to process. Nevertheless, building speech processing models that handle such a wide variety of conditions would be particularly useful for language acquisition studies, where researchers are interested in the quantity and quality of the speech that children hear and produce, as well as for early diagnosis and measuring effects of remediation. In this paper, we present our approach to designing an open-source neural network to classify audio segments into vocalizations produced by the child wearing the recording device, vocalizations produced by other children, adult male speech, and adult female speech. To this end, we gathered diverse child-centered corpora, which sum up to a total of 260 hours of recordings and cover 10 languages."
214,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"Density-based clustering relies on the idea of linking groups to specific features of the probability distribution underlying the data. The reference to a true, yet unknown, population structure allows framing the clustering problem in a standard inferential setting, where the concept of ideal population clustering is defined as the partition induced by the true density function. The nonparametric formulation of this approach, known as modal clustering, draws a correspondence between the groups and the domains of attraction of the density modes. Operationally, a nonparametric density estimate is required, and a proper selection of the amount of smoothing, governing the shape of the density and hence possibly the modal structure, is crucial to identify the final partition. In this work, we address the issue of density estimation for modal clustering from an asymptotic perspective."
215,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"The tails of diboson production at the LHC are sensitive to the interference between Standard Model and higher dimension operators parameterizing the effects of heavy new physics. However, helicity selection rules for the diboson scattering amplitudes create an obstruction to the naive interference contributions of dimension six operators, causing the total diboson rate correction's leading contribution to cancel. In this instance, carefully measuring the azimuthal decay angles ""resurrects"" the interference, restoring sensitivity to the ""non-interfering"" operators. We explore these signatures in detail and find that the EFT uncertainties associated with higher-dimensional operators are uniquely well-suppressed by the construction of an asymmetry variable that is only generated by these non-interfering operators, relegating the effects of higher-dimensional, interfering operators to the same status as statistical errors in this observable."
216,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"Causal inference from observational data is the aim of many data analyses in the health and social sciences. However, academic statistics has often disapproved of data analyses with a causal objective. The introduction of the term ""data science"" offers a historic opportunity to redefine data analysis in a way that naturally accommodates causal inference from observational data. Like others before, we organize the scientific contributions of data science into three categories: description, prediction, and counterfactual prediction (which includes causal inference). An explicit classification of data science tasks is necessary to discuss the data, assumptions, and analytics required to successfully complete each task. We argue that failure to adequately describe the role of subject-matter expert knowledge in data analysis is a source of widespread misunderstandings about data science."
217,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"The weak gravity conjecture (WGC) demands the existence of superextremal particles in any consistent quantum theory of gravity. The standard belief is that these particles are introduced to ensure that extremal black holes are either unstable or marginally stable, yet it is not clear what is wrong if this doesn't happen. This note shows that, for a generic Einstein quantum theory of gravity in AdS, exact stability of extremal black branes is in tension with rigorously proven quantum information theorems about entanglement entropy. Avoiding the contradiction leads to a nonperturbative version of the WGC, which reduces to the usual statement at weak coupling. The argument is general, and it does not rely on either supersymmetry or a particular UV completion, assuming only the validity of Einsteinian gravity, effective field theory, and holography."
218,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"Understanding how strongly correlated two-dimensional (2d) systems can give rise to unconventional superconductivity with high critical temperatures is one of the major unsolved puzzles in condensed matter physics. Ultracold 2d fermi gases have emerged as clean and controllable model systems to study the interplay of strong correlations and reduced dimensionality, but direct evidence of superfluidity in these systems has been lacking. Here, we demonstrate superfluidity in an ultracold 2d fermi gas by moving a periodic potential through the system and observing no dissipation below a critical velocity v$_{\rm c}$. We measure v$_{\rm c}$ as a function of interaction strength and discover a maximum in the crossover regime between bosonic and fermionic superfluidity. Our measurement establishes ultracold fermi gases as a powerful tool for studying the influence of reduced dimensionality on strongly correlated superfluids."
219,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"Ordinary differential equation (ODE) is a mathematical model used in various application areas such as climatology, bioinformatics, and chemical engineering, with its intuitive appeal to modeling. Despite ODE's wide usage in modeling, the frequent absence of their analytic solutions makes it difficult to estimate ODE parameters from the data, especially when the model has many variables and parameters. This paper proposes a Bayesian ODE parameter estimating algorithm that is fast and accurate even for models with numerous parameters. The proposed method approximates an ODE model with a state-space model based on equations of a numeric solver. It allows fast estimation by avoiding computations of an entire numerical solution in the likelihood. The posterior is obtained by a variational Bayes method, more specifically, the approximate Riemannian conjugate gradient method (Honkela et al.)."
220,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"We study the transport properties and superconducting proximity effect in NSN junctions formed by a time-reversal symmetry broken Weyl semimetal (WSM) in proximity to an $s$-wave superconductor. We find that the differential conductance and induced pairing amplitudes strongly depend on the angle between the junction direction in real space and the axis separating the Weyl nodes in momentum space. We identify the influence of a chiral chemical potential, i.e., the electron population imbalance between Weyl nodes of opposite chirality, on the transport characteristics of the junction. Remarkably, we observe a net spin polarization of Cooper pairs that are generated via Andreev reflection in the two WSM regions. The spin polarization is opposite in the two WSM regions and highly sensitive to the chirality imbalance and excitation energy."
221,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"Metal ion implantation into ceramics has been demonstrated to be an effective and controllable technique for tailoring the surface electrical conductivity of the ceramic piece, and this approach has been used in numerous applications. Importantly, it provides a method for grading the voltage drop across high voltage insulators, thereby increasing the maximum operational voltage that can be applied across the insulator without surface flashover. However, a concern for the use of the method is the long-term stability of the implantation-induced conductivity, especially if the implanted metal species is readily oxidized. Here, we report on our examination of the long-term behavior of the surface conductivity of titanium-implanted alumina. The results indicate that after an initial drop of as much as 40% in the first few weeks post-implantation, the conductivity shows only a very slow decrease of about 10% over the following year."
222,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"We introduce a novel Skyrme-like conserved current in the effective theory of pions and vector mesons based on the idea of hidden local symmetry. The associated charge is equivalent to the skyrmion charge for any smooth configuration. In addition, there exist singular configurations that can be identified as \( n_f=1 \) baryons charged under the new symmetry. Under this identification, the vector mesons play the role of the Chern-Simons vector fields living on the quantum Hall droplet that forms the \( n_f=1 \) baryon. We propose that this current is the correct effective expression for the baryon current at low energies. This proposal provides a unified picture for the two types of baryons and allows them to continuously transform one into the other in a natural way. In addition, Chern-Simons dualities on the droplet can be interpreted as a result of Seiberg-like duality between gluons and vector mesons."
223,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"Interfacial spin-orbit coupling in Josephson junctions offers an intriguing way to combine anomalous Hall and Josephson physics in a single device. We study theoretically how the superposition of both effects impacts superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator/superconductor junctions' transport properties. Transverse momentum-dependent skew tunneling of Cooper pairs through the spin-active ferromagnetic insulator interface creates sizable transverse Hall supercurrents, which we refer to as anomalous Josephson Hall effect currents. We generalize the Furusaki-Tsukada formula, originally established to quantify usual (tunneling) Josephson current flows, to evaluate the transverse current components and demonstrate that their amplitudes are widely adjustable by means of the spin-orbit coupling strengths or the superconducting phase difference across the junction. As a clear spectroscopic fingerprint of Josephson junctions, well-localized subgap bound states form around the interface."
224,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"Following the suggestion from the Monte Carlo experiments in Jiménez, J. of Turbul. (2020), that dipoles are as crucial to the dynamics of decaying two-dimensional turbulence as individual vortex cores, it is found that the kinetic energy of this flow is carried by elongated streams formed by the concatenation of dipoles. Vortices separate into a family of small, fast-moving cores, and another family of larger, slowly moving ones, which can be described as 'frozen' into a slowly evolving 'crystal.' The kinematics of both families are very different, and only the former is self-similar. The latter is responsible for most of the kinetic energy of the flow, and its vortices form the dipoles and streams. Mechanisms are discussed for the growth of this slow component."
225,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"Continuous-time quantum walks have proven to be an extremely useful framework for the design of several quantum algorithms. Often, the running time of quantum algorithms in this framework is characterized by the quantum hitting time: the time required by the quantum walk to find a vertex of interest with a high probability. In this article, we provide improved upper bounds for the quantum hitting time that can be applied to several ctqw-based quantum algorithms. In particular, we apply our techniques to the glued-trees problem, improving their hitting time upper bound by a polynomial factor: from $o(n^5)$ to $o(n^2\log n)$. Furthermore, our methods also help to exponentially improve the dependence on the precision of the continuous-time quantum walk based algorithm to find a marked node on any ergodic, reversible Markov chain by Chakraborty et al."

Dry (or the ""loss-cone"") emris, previously considered as the main emri sources for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, are primarily produced by multi-body scattering in the nuclear star cluster and gravitational capture. In this letter, we highlight an alternative emri formation channel: (wet) emri formation assisted by the accretion flow around accreting galactic-center massive black holes (mbhs). In this channel, the accretion disk captures stellar-mass black holes that are initially moving on inclined orbits, and subsequently drives them to migrate towards the mbh - this process boosts the formation rate of emris in such galaxies by orders of magnitude."

Under such circumstances, we still expect our recommender systems to attract users the first time so that they decide to stay on the website and become active users. This problem falls into the new user cold-start category and is crucial to the development and even survival of a company. Existing works on user cold-start recommendation either require additional user efforts, such as setting up an interview process, or make use of side information [10] such as user demographics, locations, social relations, etc. However, users may not be willing to take the interview and side information on cold-start users is usually not available."
228,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"Deep learning has solved many problems that are out of reach of heuristic algorithms. It has also been successfully applied in wireless communications, even though the current radio systems are well-understood and optimal algorithms exist for many tasks. While some gains have been obtained by learning parts of a receiver, a better approach is to jointly learn the entire receiver. This, however, often results in a challenging nonlinear problem, for which the optimal solution is infeasible to implement. To this end, we propose a deep fully convolutional neural network, deeprx, which executes the whole receiver pipeline from frequency domain signal stream to uncoded bits in a 5G-compliant fashion. We facilitate accurate channel estimation by constructing the input of the convolutional neural network in a very specific manner using both the data and pilot symbols."
229,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"Mutation-based fuzzing typically uses an initial set of non-crashing seed inputs (a corpus) from which to generate new inputs by mutation. A corpus of potential seeds will often contain thousands of similar inputs. This lack of diversity can lead to wasted fuzzing effort through exhaustive mutation from all available seeds. To address this, fuzzers come with distillation tools (e.g., afl-cmin) that select the smallest subset of seeds that triggers the same range of instrumentation data points as the full corpus. Common practice suggests that minimizing the number and cumulative size of the seeds leads to more efficient fuzzing, which we explore systematically. We present results of over 34 cpu-years of fuzzing with five distillation approaches to understand their impact in finding bugs in real-world software."
230,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"In this paper, we investigate multi-agent discrete-event systems with partial observation. The agents can be divided into several groups, each of which has similar (isomorphic) state transition structures. Thus, they can be relabeled into the same template. Based on the template, a scalable supervisor whose state size and computational cost are independent of the number of agents is designed for partial observation. The scalable supervisor under partial observation does not need to be recomputed regardless of how many agents are added to or removed from the system. We generalize our earlier results to partial observation by proposing sufficient conditions for safety and maximal permissiveness of the scalable least restrictive supervisor at the template level. An example is provided to illustrate the proposed scalable supervisory synthesis."
231,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"Electric network frequency (ENF) fluctuations constitute a powerful tool in multimedia forensics. An efficient approach for ENF estimation is introduced with temporal windowing based on the filter-bank Capon spectral estimator. A type of Gohberg-Semencul factorization of the model covariance matrix is used due to the Toeplitz structure of the covariance matrix. Moreover, this approach uses, for the first time in the field of ENF, a temporal window, not necessarily the rectangular one, at the stage preceding spectral estimation. Krylov matrices are employed for fast implementation of matrix inversions. The proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in ENF estimation, when a short time window of one second is employed in power recordings. In speech recordings, the proposed approach yields highly accurate results with respect to both time complexity and accuracy."

The package also contains a set of classical and robust preprocessing utilities, including generalized spatial signs, as well as dedicated plotting functionality and cross-validation utilities.

233,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"Nonlinear fluorescence emission has been widely applied for high spatial resolution optical imaging. Here, we studied the fluorescence anomalous saturating effect of the nitrogen vacancy defect in diamond. Fluorescence reduction was observed with high power laser excitation. It increased the nonlinearity of fluorescence emission and altered the spatial frequency distribution of the fluorescence image. We used a differential excitation protocol to extract the high spatial frequency information. By modulating the excitation laser power, the spatial resolution of imaging was improved approximately 1.6 times in comparison with confocal microscopy. Due to the simplicity of the experimental setup and data processing, we expect this method can be used to improve the spatial resolution of sensing and biological labeling with defects in solids."
234,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"When random effects are correlated with sample design variables, the usual approach of employing individual survey weights (constructed to be inversely proportional to the unit survey inclusion probabilities) to form a pseudo-likelihood no longer produces asymptotically unbiased inference. We construct a weight-exponentiated formulation for the random effects distribution that achieves unbiased inference for estimating hyperparameters of the random effects. We contrast our approach with frequentist methods that rely on numerical integration to reveal that only the Bayesian method achieves both unbiased estimation with respect to the sampling design distribution and consistency with respect to the population generating distribution. Our simulations and real data example for a survey of business establishments demonstrate the utility of our approach across various modeling formulations and sampling designs. This work serves as a capstone for recent developmental efforts that combine traditional survey estimation techniques with the Bayesian modeling paradigm and provides a bridge across the two rich but disparate sub-fields."

For the first time, it was found that in a mesogenic polymer, in contrast to low-molecular-weight mesogens, the relaxation of the electric birefringence of a melt above the temperature of the nematic-isotropic phase transition can be modeled by a sum of several exponential processes, two of which play a decisive role. These main processes replace each other in a temperature range of approximately fifty degrees. Dielectric spectroscopy also made it possible to distinguish two processes of orientational relaxation: the first is due to rotation of the side mesogenic groups, and the second is associated with motion of the main chain segments."
237,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"Deep hashing methods have demonstrated excellent retrieval accuracy and efficiency in large-scale image retrieval. Optimizing discrete hash bits is always the central focus in deep hashing methods. A common strategy in these methods is to adopt an activation function, e.g. $\operatorname{sigmoid}(\cdot)$ or $\operatorname{tanh}(\cdot)$, and minimize quantization loss to approximate discrete values. However, this paradigm may cause more and more hash bits to get stuck in the wrong saturated area of the activation functions, with no escape. We call this the ""dead bits problem~(dbp)."" Additionally, the existing quantization loss exacerbates dbp. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective gradient amplifier that acts before activation functions to alleviate dbp."

The former is constrained by disappearing charged track searches at the LHC and by dark matter direct detection experiments, while the latter is constrained by existing multilepton collider searches. We find that a two-step electroweak phase transition involving a stable triplet with a negative quadratic term is ruled out by direct detection searches, while an unstable triplet with a mass less than $230\ \mathrm{GeV}$ is excluded at $95\%$ confidence level."

The standard scenario posits an initially circular and narrow belt of planetesimals at semi-major axis $a$, whose eccentricity is increased to $e_f$ after the gas disc has dispersed by secular perturbations from an eccentric planet, resulting in a belt of width $2ae_f$. In a minor modification of this scenario, narrower belts can arise if the planetesimals are initially eccentric, which could result from earlier planet perturbations during the gas-rich protoplanetary disc phase. However, a primordial eccentricity could alternatively be caused by instabilities that increase the disc's eccentricity, without the need for any planets."

Here, we report on measurements of many-body modes in 1D gated wires using a tunneling spectroscopy technique. We observe two separate Fermi seas at high energies, associated with spin and charge excitations, together with the emergence of three additional 1D 'replica' modes that strengthen with decreasing wire length.

To this end, we combined the kinematic information provided by Gaia for almost all galactic clusters, with the largest sample of cluster ages available after carefully correcting for systematic errors.

In this paper, we identify a surprising consequence of popularity-based rankings: the fewer the items reporting a given signal, the higher the share of the overall traffic they collectively attract. This few-get-richer effect emerges in settings where there are few distinct categories of items (e.g., left-leaning news sources versus right-leaning news sources), and items are ranked based on their popularity. We demonstrate analytically that the few-get-richer effect arises when people tend to click on top-ranked items and have heterogeneous preferences for the types of items. Using simulations, we analyze how the strength of the effect varies with assumptions about the setting and human behavior. We also test our predictions experimentally in an online experiment with human participants. Our findings have important implications for understanding the spread of misinformation."
245,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"Weight pruning has been widely acknowledged as a straightforward and effective method to eliminate redundancy in deep neural networks (DNN), thereby achieving acceleration on various platforms. However, most pruning techniques involve trade-offs between model accuracy and regularity, which lead to impaired inference accuracy and limited on-device acceleration performance. To solve this problem, we introduce a new sparsity dimension, namely pattern-based sparsity that comprises pattern and connectivity sparsity, becoming both highly accurate and hardware friendly. With carefully designed patterns, the proposed pruning unprecedentedly and consistently achieves accuracy enhancement and better feature extraction ability on various DNN structures and datasets. Our pattern-aware pruning framework also achieves pattern library extraction, pattern selection, pattern and connectivity pruning, and weight training simultaneously. Our approach to the new pattern-based sparsity naturally fits into compiler optimization for highly efficient DNN execution on mobile platforms."

We analyze the effect of mountaintop removal mining (MRM) on mortality using a difference-in-differences analysis that utilizes the increase in MRM following the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments. For a difference-in-differences analysis of the effect of MRM on mortality, we constructed a more closely matched control group and found a 95% confidence interval that contains substantial adverse effects along with no effect and small beneficial effects."

This procedure is a generic method that is straightforward to apply, in general.

(ii) analytically predict the probability that a quantum system is transferred into a target quantum state by means of stochastic sequential measurements. (iii) optimally reconstruct the spectral density of environmental noise sources by orthogonalizing in the frequency domain the filter functions driving the designed quantum sensor.

But I'd like to argue that for an important kind of activity, doing two things at once — or three or even four — is exactly what we should be aiming for. Look no further than Albert Einstein. In 1905, he published four remarkable scientific papers."

We would build projects together, like model rockets and slot cars. Here's the go-kart that we built together. That's me behind the wheel, with my sister and my best friend at the time. And one day, he came home, when I was about 10 years old, and at the dinner table, he announced that for our next project, we were going to build ... a robot."

I want to know the people behind my dinner choices. I want to know how I impact them. I want to know how they impact me. I want to know why they fish. I want to know how they rely on the water's bounty for their living. Understanding all of this enables us to shift our perception of seafood away from a commodity to an opportunity to restore our ecosystem. It allows us to celebrate the seafood that we're also so fortunate to eat. So, what do we call this? I think we call it restorative seafood. Where sustainability is the capacity to endure and maintain, restorative is the ability to replenish and progress."

The stone-hearted miser plagued by the ghost of Christmas past. More than a century after his death, these remain recognizable figures from the work of Charles Dickens. So striking is his body of work that it gave rise to its own adjective. But what are the features of Dickens's writing that make it so special? Dickens’s fiction brims with anticipation through brooding settings, plot twists, and mysteries. These features of his work kept his audience wanting more. When first published, his stories were serialized, meaning they were released a few chapters at a time in affordable literary journals and only later reprinted as books."

That technology involves simulating humans. It's simulated humans with a simulated body and a simulated nervous system to control that body. Now, before I talk more about this technology, let's have a quick look at what human characters currently look like in computer games. This is a clip from a game called ""Grand Theft Auto 3.""

Here we are, watching these incredible athletes, the goals were amazing, the games were clean and engaging, and at the same time, outside the field, these women were advocating for equal pay, and in the case of some countries, any pay at all for their sport. So because we were mildly obsessed, we wanted to watch the games live, and we decided that one of the Spanish-speaking networks in the US was the best place for us to start. And it wasn't until a few games into the tournament that a friend of mine spoke to me and said, ""Why does it feel like everything I'm seeing is commercials for makeup and household cleaning products and diets?"

Now, the Yap don't actually move these rai stones around or exchange them the way we do with our coins, because rai stones can get to be pretty massive. The largest is about four tons and 12 feet across. So the Yap just keep track of who owns part of what stone. There's a story about these sailors that were transporting a stone across the ocean when they ran into some trouble and the stone actually fell in."

If you insist that you’re innocent anyway, you’ll likely be found guilty and executed. But if you confess, apologize, and implicate others for good measure, you’ll go free. Do you give a false confession—or risk a public hanging? This was the choice facing those accused of witchcraft in the village of Salem, Massachusetts, between February 1692 and May 1693. They were the victims of paranoia about the supernatural, misdirected religious fervor—and a justice system that valued repentance over truth. Salem was settled in 1626 by Puritans, a group of English Protestants. Life was strict and isolated for the people of Salem. Battles with their Native American neighbors and groups of French settlers were commonplace."

Unfortunately, there aren’t nearly enough donor organs available to meet that demand. What if, instead of waiting, we could create brand-new, customized organs from scratch? That’s the idea behind bioprinting, a branch of regenerative medicine currently under development. We’re not able to print complex organs just yet, but simpler tissues including blood vessels and tubes responsible for nutrient and waste exchange are already within our grasp. Bioprinting is a biological cousin of 3D printing, a technique that deposits layers of material on top of each other to construct a three-dimensional object one slice at a time."

On top of that, those are the places from where trouble comes. So we have an ironic problem — good teachers don't want to go to just those places where they're needed the most. I started in 1999 to try and address this issue with an experiment, which was a very simple experiment in New Delhi."

With the majority of refugees living in urban areas, there is a strong need for a paradigm shift and new thinking. Rather than wasting money on building walls, it would be better to spend on programs to help refugees to help themselves. We always have to leave behind all our possessions, but not our skills and knowledge. If allowed to live a productive life, refugees can help themselves and contribute to the development of their host country.

And I ask my students these two questions, and then I share how I answer them, which is in these three sentences that go: I am the daughter of Black writers, who are descended from freedom fighters who broke their chains and changed the world. They call me. And these are words I repeat in a mantra before every single poetry performance. In fact, I was doing it in the corner over there. I was making faces."

Sputnik was actually not the first piece of human technology to enter space. That distinction goes to the V-2 rocket used by Germany in missile attacks against Allied cities as a last-ditch effort in the final years of World War II. It wasn't very effective, but, at the end of the war, both the U.S. and U.S.S.R. had captured the technology and the scientists that had developed it and began using them for their own projects."

From my experience and that of the women around me, I can tell you that it's exhausting. It's exhausting to carefully take out a brown paper bag hiding a pad, stuffing it into your pocket in the middle of a class and rushing to the washroom as discreetly as possible.

His skin was covered in painful scabs, and he wondered why he alone had been marked with this affliction.

Essentially, the company was developing a medical device that allowed the entire blood panel to be run from just a finger-stick of blood. This innovation would eliminate the need for a large needle to draw blood for tests. This technology was intriguing not only because it was less painful, but also because it could potentially pave the way for predictive diagnostics."

And in this community, we didn't have a television; we didn't have computers, obviously, or radio. We didn't even have a telephone. All of my time was spent outside with the Inuit, playing.

In order to do that, I need to explain something about the origin of the solar system. When we go back four and a half billion years, there was a cloud of gas and dust. In the center of this cloud, our sun formed and ignited. Along with that, what we now know as planets, comets, and asteroids formed. What then happened, according to theory, is that when the Earth had cooled down a bit after its formation, comets massively impacted the Earth and delivered water. They probably also delivered complex organic material, which may have bootstrapped the emergence of life."

President Theodore Roosevelt slept in a grove of towering sequoia trees, camped in a snowstorm, and spent hours talking around the campfire with his host and guide, conservationist John Muir. Roosevelt famously loved the outdoors, but Muir had invited him there for more than just camping: Yosemite was in danger. Though Yosemite became protected land in 1864, the valley was still at risk for overdevelopment in 1903. It was at the heart of a decades-old struggle to set aside land for both preservation and public use—two goals that were much easier said than done. The battle over Yosemite began with the 1849 Gold Rush, when miners surged west, seeking gold in the Sierra Nevada foothills."

As a young reporter, I thought that I should do it differently, so it has maximum impact, since everybody knew it was happening, and yet there was nothing keeping it out of the system. So I decided to go there and act as a seller. As part of selling, I was able to document the hard core evidence. The impact was great. It was fantastic.

Carbon works in a natural cycle, present in all living things: in the soil, in the oceans, in the atmosphere, and in rocks deep underground. When plants and other living things die, much of their stored carbon returns to the atmosphere until new plants grow and reabsorb the carbon. But over millions of years, some of the carbon stored in ancient trees and sea life becomes rock, and some becomes fossil fuels: coal, oil, and natural gas. Natural events like volcanic eruptions release some of the carbon trapped in rock. Human activities, like burning fossil fuels, also release some of that prehistoric carbon. Today, humans release around 60 times more carbon than all the volcanoes on the planet each year."

Yet one of the greatest differences between natural and human technologies relates to robustness. Robust systems are stable in complex and new environments. Remarkably, cockroaches can self-stabilize while running over rough terrain. When we put a jet pack on them or give them a perturbation like an earthquake, we discovered that their wonderfully tuned legs allow them to self-stabilize without using any of their brainpower. They can traverse complex terrain like grass effortlessly, and not get destabilized. We discovered a new behavior where, due to their shape, they automatically roll to their side to navigate through this artificial test bit of grass. Robust systems can perform multiple tasks with the same structure. Here's a new behavior we've discovered."

(Laughter) I hope that's happening. So because of this ability, we humans are able to transmit our ideas across vast reaches of space and time. We're able to transmit knowledge across minds."

I like working with media and technology because, a, I'm familiar with them and I appreciate the power they hold. And b, I distrust them and I'm terrified of the power they hold. (laughter) I remember watching, in 2003, an interview between Fox News host Tony Snow and then-U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.

Well, well. That’s unusually prescient for a human. Looking for a wedding dress? Try a new take on a timeless classic. It’s sleek, flattering, and modest—just like the traditional dress. Commercials. Could anything be more insufferable? It’s 1997, and the United States Senate has called a hearing about global warming.

The other thing to consider is what an honor it is, as a politician, to give a TED Talk, particularly here in the U.K., where the reputation of politics, with the expenses scandal, has sunk so low. There was even a story recently that scientists had considered actually replacing rats in their experiments with politicians. Someone asked, ""Why?"" and they said, ""Well, there's no shortage of politicians, no one really minds what happens to them and, after all, there are some things that rats just won't do."" (Laughter) Now, I know you all love data, so I'm starting with a data-rich slide."
