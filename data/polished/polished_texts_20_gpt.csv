1,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Another week just flew by. I drove past the new house yesterday, and the front window was covered in boxes. We may get the keys at closing, and I am getting so excited. If all goes well this week, we will be set for closing a week from Wednesday. I was up until after 3:00 a.m. last night watching movies with Bethany. There's been a lot of movie-watching going on around here lately. Here's my rundown: last night we watched ""Thirteen,"" a movie every mother of a teen should see. It was better than I expected. Then we watched ""Gigli."" Yeah, it was just as bad as the media said, but we had to see for ourselves."
2,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Summer TV used to be a dead zone full of repeats. Now, there are two great new shows, and I've been watching both religiously for the past week. ""Blow Out"" has the most unexpected concept ever, seemingly with zero representation. Hairstylist Jonathan Antin wants to build a second location of his incredibly popular West Hollywood salon, this time in Beverly Hills. Normally, no one would care, certainly not I, but as I was flipping through the channels, I caught a glimpse of Jonathan, equally narcissistic and dull, looking at an empty space on Rodeo Drive and declaring, ""I am going to build here the greatest salon in the history of the world ever!"" and I was hooked. Not since Rocco have I found someone so compelling to watch on TV."
3,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"What a week... My right shoulder has tendinitis, just under my shoulder blade. When I move my arm too much, especially using a computer mouse, it’s painful. I can't move it much now because I was busy updating my website and working on other online tasks. I can barely find the strength to draw anything. Lack of sleep adds to my pain. I'm not too happy right now, but I'll get better. My mom's surgery went okay. Her eyesight has somewhat returned; she can see fuzzy shapes and distinguish colors. However, she's still mostly blind. Hopefully, she'll fully regain her vision soon."
4,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"The kindness of strangers... Attempted laundry today with the kids in tow and realized how quickly the simplest tasks can become a complete ordeal. I also discovered how remarkably kind total strangers can be, simply because they choose to be. Trust me, it wasn't like they were trying to get into my pants or anything. I had kid drool all over me and was wearing my 'wash-day' outfit... Plus, I'm not super sure I'll ever be bathing again, so it's not like there was even an olfactory incentive there! I am doing two things right now. I am composing a post and also watching the collected No Doubt videos. I am doing both of these things sitting at my desk in my room."
5,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"It's 11:14 p.m. MST, and here I sit in my bedroom fixing the computer of the personnel director from my job. Not that I mind, but I wonder how often I find myself fixing someone else's computer as a favor. I'm glad to show love and support this way, but where is the line drawn when you are being taken advantage of? The past couple of weeks, I've stayed up late reading, so I was looking forward to going to bed early until I realized it would be more prudent to get this computer out of my bedroom and back to its owner. *laugh* No rest for the weary, right? So I found myself watching Joe Schmo 2 again tonight."
6,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Could you remind me what I wrote about before this? Or perhaps, this is a continuation of the ""is this a date?"" saga. After the unusual lunch, my confidence shaken, I forgot to share an important part of the story. Before Pat arrives for lunch, Dustin starts talking about what a nice guy Pat is and how he's trying to find a girlfriend for him. I'm listening, nodding, and realizing we're talking more about finding Dustin's best friend a girl than anything you typically discuss over pink lemonade with a stranger. I excused myself to the bathroom, looked in the mirror, and silently asked myself: am I being pawned off to the other guy? Is this what happens now?"
7,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"I would like everyone to think before they act. Actually, I'd like every single person in the world to think before they get out of bed in the morning and commit to keep thinking all day. If they're not prepared to, I'd very much like them to hop back in bed and drift off to an eternal slumber. I'm sick to death of foolish people. No, I'm not the smartest person in the world, but I'm not talking about things that require a lot of brain power, so I think it's fair to criticize the inanely stupid. Let's see if I can keep this particular rant to a few specific types, and we'll save some for another day. Sound good? Great."
8,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Two problems with the scenario outlined in my previous post: 1. While it's true that Bush is stimulating the economy, it's in the wrong way. Robert Rubin told NPR's Marketplace today that Bush could have achieved the same stimulus effect without a long-term debt hangover by enacting different tax cuts—temporary ones that would benefit low- and middle-income individuals. Ah, Robert Rubin. The sound of his name is music to our ears. Quick: can you name a Bush administration cabinet official on the domestic side with Rubin's gravitas? Still thinking? It’ll come to you... 2. We can't give the Republicans control only during wartime because they’ve ingeniously concocted an endless, global 'war on terrorism.'"

Went to the Cove to see Supernothing; they were good as usual. Got to chill with Tiago :-). Saturday, went to work and then out with Joe and Rach. Met up with Steve, Tiago, and Tom. Came home at around quarter to twelve and woke up the next morning at quarter to seven for a meet. Got there a little late, but it's all good. I did my full routine on floor and didn't fall: placed second on floor and vault, and third on beam, with a 29.45 all-around, which isn't bad because my meets improve as the season progresses."
10,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Do you ever have one of those moments when you begin to reflect on life? Like you're sitting in math class, bored out of your mind, and you wonder what goes on in your brain that makes you understand math. Then you realize you exist and are in math class and wonder why. Suddenly, it hits you—the fact that you're going off on this random train of thought feels incredibly pathetic. Ever had that happen? I hate that. You know what else I hate? Block schedules. Who would ever come up with that idea? Anyone can see that sitting through a two-and-a-half-hour class in any subject is cruel and unusual punishment."
11,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"I think Monopoly has run its course in my life, and I vow never to lay my hands on that iron (not a hot one but the piece in the game) again. Tonight Andy beat me by a few small dollars and won the game, or maybe I let him win on account of him leaving in a few short hours and me wanting him to feel good on his last night here. However, the story goes, it can't compare to this Texas-sized headache I have at the moment. I've taken some Aleve, and I must say they are doing the trick. All I need now is some well-deserved R&R. Your telephone's the one that helped me wrap the cord around your neck... At the drive-in."
12,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Today has been quite a long day. We drove home from Indiana. I'll need to be selective about what I write because I could spend a lot of time and space, and I just don't have the energy. First off, camp was incredible and exceeded my expectations. God has been working a lot in my life lately, and it's truly amazing. I've turned over a new leaf, I guess, but anyway, back to the beginning. We arrived at the Twiggs' house on Friday evening and stayed until we left for camp on Monday. Most of our time was spent going to the fair, church, a parade, Walmart, and watching movies."
13,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Today is my last day of summer vacation! Oh no! And I have a dentist appointment at 9. I hate that, but I'd rather get it over with than try to schedule it during the first month of my surgery rotation. I'm definitely nervous, scared, jittery, and any other words you can think of for ""no way, I don't want to go"" to school. This is going to be a whole new experience for me. As a perfectionist, I love excelling at everything I do. But starting new things is challenging. I hate being a pawn (like I told Cassie: ""I'm going to be the only pawn on the chessboard who insists on moving like a knight""), and I hate not knowing what's going on."
14,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Arun Shourie discusses how the current governor of Uttar Pradesh had warned, as early as 1996, about the imminent threat of the emergence of a 'third Islamic state' in the subcontinent. T. V. Rajeswar, the former head of the Intelligence Bureau and current governor of Uttar Pradesh, had predicted this dire threat in a series of articles published in the Hindustan Times back in 1996. Shourie raises a valid point when he says, does the fact that you now know that he, and not I, not to mention Mr. Advani, wrote all that make the warnings ring true? Or do you conclude that because he wrote in this refrain, T. V. Rajeswar is a closet communalist and should not be allowed to continue as governor of Uttar Pradesh?"
15,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Attitude: bored; mood: indifferent. Looking forward to tonight after a long, hard day in the trenches here, folks—almost no time to write for you readers. However, it's good to see Tigger (now Akcron) taking up the reins herself, making an appearance, and talking about things :) Not much to say; yesterday was Shakespeare on the Green. It was a lovely play, but I had to leave before the closing curtain, which was disappointing. Hopefully, someday I'll see the entirety of a Shakespeare play. But I digress. Akcron is right about the problems with the shower—it really sucks. As for laughing at her in the shower, you have to admit, the look people get when committing self-torture can be pretty entertaining."
16,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Suddenly, over the past two days, I have been overcome with terrible bouts of exhaustion. Bone-deep exhaustion. Last evening, I went home and slept, only waking when my mother called around eight-thirty. When I awoke, it was dark, and I hadn't turned the lights on, so I couldn't determine the time or date. For a few seconds, it was just my mother's voice in the darkness and me grappling with reality. I wonder why I'm feeling so drained... The weather is nice this morning. It was drizzling when I arrived. However, I've heard that in Calcutta, it's been raining for the past three days."
17,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Last night was the worst. I discarded the sweater I was knitting, which was only about 14 inches long. I lost probably $10 worth of yarn (it's $8 per skein), but it had too many stitches by the time I reached the armholes, and the mohair was tangling as I knitted, so frogging (ripping out rows) didn’t work well. The yarn broke frequently. I didn’t even swear, which is unusual for me. I just morosely ripped and listened to season two of Sex and the City (way to go, library!). Then, I got sick of it and discarded it. I suppose I could say I learned a lot while attempting to make this sweater."
18,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Last night in class, we discussed this week's assigned reading, ""Getting Back into Place: Toward a Renewed Study of the Place-World"" by Edward S. Casey. The first chapter addresses “implacement” and the second, “displacement.” In the first chapter, Casey distinguishes that our contemporary culture centers around time as the situating force: we are running out of time, we have saved time, we are just in time. He argues that using place as the cultural center fosters a more grounded community. (This is a very rough summary, a disclaimer in case my professor or any other classmate reads this post.) So far, this book is the first reading that has captivated me."
19,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Whatever they put into freeze pops to make them those colors, there should be a warning label: may make your life a bit bizarre. And while giggling is fun, one wonders if we would have found ourselves up that fire escape drinking beer in the fierce wind had we not eaten them earlier. Finding ourselves in a doorway to a bar unfortunately closed for business, we stopped to examine an office-supplies catalog that had arrived in the mail. Lucky we did. Who could have possibly guessed that within these pages were the special offers of a lifetime? Not I, for certain. I list but a few: buy 36 permanent marker pens, get a stunt kite. Buy 30 lever arch files, get a barbecue."
20,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Currently listening to: ""The Little Drummer Boy"" by Stevan Pasero...and now my post... Senate Republicans, okay, hands up—who watched the 39-hour judicial nominations marathon last week? I know I didn't. Well, okay—I did tune in once or twice. The entire colossal waste of time was orchestrated by Republicans who, upset that Democrats wouldn't easily nominate four of Bush's extreme justices, were trying to score political points by holding a multi-day protest. Never mind the fact that the Democrats have already approved 168 of Bush's judicial nominees—no, that's not good enough for the power-hungry Republicans who are, for some reason, laboring under the misapprehension they have a significant mandate for this kind of nonsense."
21,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"This was a good weekend. I indulged in nature’s greenery, and after a long break, I listened to a lot of Nevermore (something I should have started doing much earlier) and read extensively. I finished three books over the weekend - Bruce Sterling's ""Heavy Weather,"" Larry Niven's ""World of Ptavvs,"" and Octavia Butler's ""Parable of the Sower."" ""Heavy Weather"" was a good cyberpunk adventure set in a near-future USA, devastated by global warming and general anarchy. While it was clever, well-paced, and altogether very convincing, I must admit that I failed to come away with any truly significant impressions of the story or characters. Not that both aren't well-constructed and vividly etched - it's a good book, but not a great one, I suppose."
22,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Because this is the aftermath, the first week back from practicum was a struggle, but it is only in the second week that the smoke has truly started to clear. Post-practicum trauma was a hidden epidemic that is only now coming to light. I was affected, but the eventual meeting with the course coordinator allowed me to release my burden and, by doing so, I prevented another person from being stuck with such a pedagogically deficient practicum school. Yesterday (Monday), I bumped into another aggrieved classmate who was determined to warn the student scheduled to attend her school in the next practicum about how terrible it would be. I calmed her down and suggested that we should go to the administrator first."
23,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Things are incredibly busy here at times, but there's always time for supposed stress-relieving activities. I've found that I really struggle with 8-ball and ping pong! Rick (the Canuck) beats me regularly—we have a ping pong table in the front lobby of our building, always time for a 'quick round'. Last night, I participated in an 8-ball tournament at the hot spot (our recreation tent, complete with a popcorn machine, numerous TVs, jukebox, DVD rental, pool table, dart board, and ever-present ping pong table). Anyway, I was doing well in my one entire game—until I scratched on the eight ball. I still had a good time—the most fun was with the two Dutch soldiers that joined the tournament."
24,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Fall 1974: I was attempting for what felt like the 13th time to fight my way through the second chapter of my high school algebra book. I was not then nor am I now a math person. I detest math. I am math phobic. You get the idea. As I struggled to make sense of algebra, the doorbell rang. I set down my book and opened the door. No one was there. Great. I returned to my studies, and just as I found a glimmer of understanding buried in my subconscious, the doorbell rang again. Instantly, my breakthrough disappeared. I went to the door, and once again, no one was there. Just what a struggling math student needs—an uninvited practical joker."
25,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"This past week has been nothing short of exhausting. I spent Tuesday through Thursday finishing the move to my new classroom. The new room is bigger and closer to my grade level team, which are things I need to consider as I spend hours preparing my room for this year. Had I known I was going to move before the end of the school year, I would have discarded many books and supplies I no longer use. Unfortunately, it all came with me. So this week was spent moving, unpacking, and purging extensively. I have to thank my teammate Jill for helping with all of this. She was still teaching this month, in my old room. So she and her wonderful students moved almost my entire room for me!"

Even if I never carried your child, even if I was never married to you, even if I was never an official pair to you... I loved you immensely, and to this day the feeling carries an echo through my heart. Forever will I be reminded of the nights we spent together, hearts and limbs entwined in a soul-embrace, drenched in the salty darkness of an evening by the beach... Or a kiss under the rain. Whenever I feel a dark glass puncturing my heart, you will be there. That piece of you... Bleeding the eternal love that once lived in me... And still remains... For her."
27,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"I'm uneasy. Investigative reporting feels very unsettling to me. Or let me rephrase that: the article I’m working on and its consequences is not something I'm fully comfortable with. Perhaps it's because I don’t believe in it enough, that I can’t really grasp the complete feel for it—the angst behind it, the full-out passion required to question. I've grown up in a country where you don't ask questions. Really, you just don't. They punish you for that. They incarcerate you under internal security acts. I am not used to this freedom of speech... not used to openly questioning. Sure, I am not the easiest person to get along with."
28,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"We had an outing yesterday with my colleagues from the bank. We went to Guintubdan, La Carlota. It was the first visit for most of us. We trekked to the falls, a 30-minute or so walk. We were all catching our breaths, whew! But we made it. The water was icy cold. You could feel your body becoming numb due to the chill. We stayed for less than an hour because we headed to the nearby waterfalls, another 30 minutes of trekking. The trip was worthwhile; the falls appeared calming, and the entire scene was truly breathtaking. It's like you could hear yourself becoming one with nature. Soaking in the cold water felt like communing with Mother Earth. The cold air and water were enough to lull you into sleep."

I think it is starting to sink in with Ed and all of us. I think it sunk in with me a long time ago. I just hope Ed will be here for Bailey's surgery.

Thankfully, I brought a bag of eggs just in case. Connor had a great time finding eggs in the park. On Sunday morning, when he woke up, he was so excited that the Easter Bunny had come. There's nothing better than seeing the excitement on your child's face. After egg hunting, we all went to church. While the 'Easter Bunny' is fun, we make sure our kids know the true meaning of the holiday. This was Megan's first Easter, and she looked so cute dressed in her jean dress and stockings!"

I somehow managed to get a flat tire. Luckily, I'm at work, so the guys are going to inflate it for me and make sure it holds air. If not, they're going to change my tire and put the spare on.

They believe they know you so well, perhaps even to the extent of reading your emotions. But they can't. Parents lack understanding of us. So, when I go upstairs after arguing with Nicole about Kelli, like I just did a few minutes ago, and they ask what's wrong, it's frustrating. I don't have to share what's bothering me every time. Here's the situation with Nicole and Kelli: they don't like each other. At all."

Basically, I am happy to be sitting here as opposed to still sitting in my car.

Meanwhile, a group of congressional Democrats, including four New Yorkers, has petitioned U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to send international observers to Florida for this year's presidential balloting. I humbly disagree. Based on available information, the OSCE appears to be visiting to learn from the U.S. election process, not oversee it—which was the original partisan and immature call for U.N. intervention."

By Gary Fineout and Alfonso Chardy, the citizenship ceremony in Jacksonville appeared to proceed as usual, with nearly 200 new Americans. Just before the new citizens left the June 29 event, an immigration official directing the swearing-in encouraged attendees to stop by a voter registration table—a common sight at naturalization ceremonies. However, this table was unusual: those distributing forms were Republican volunteers, and the party affiliation box had been pre-checked to make all new voters members of the GOP. It raised suspicions for Linda Cross, who was present to see her husband, Dario Cruz, take his citizenship oath."

As a non-American blogger, I've been somewhat reluctant to participate in some discussions, particularly regarding flags, but since I initiated it (the subject, not the flag-burning) I suppose I should say something. Firstly, I think the idea of having a law against flag-burning is completely irrational. The moment you start according a symbol—any symbol—that kind of automatic reverence and protection, you've taken a small but significant step towards totalitarianism. Symbols are somewhat fickle—they don’t inherently represent anything; it’s how they are perceived or made to represent that's crucial."

87,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,email_content,"The spreadsheet below outlines the implicit commodity based on the effective date of four different rates for the same rate schedule (Schedule DR). The rate schedule effective August 2000 through September 2000 results in a significantly larger commodity charge, as SDG&E customers will receive a lump sum reimbursement from SDG&E during those two months. Consequently, customers can expect lower electric bills. Assuming the lump sum reimbursement isn't included in the implicit energy component, the average for June 2000 through January 2001 is 6.2 cts, and the implicit commodity average from February 2001 through December 2001 is 7.3 cts. Thus, the average implicit commodity from June 2000 through December 2001 is 6.9 cts; for deliveries starting September 1, 2000, the average remains 6.9 cts."

It's a game to enjoy with friends (or frenemies), laughing, talking smack, and delivering game-winning plays. Wizards of the Coast seems to have forgotten this. If you choose to play with friends, you can't earn gold, which is crucial. Gold is so essential that they have implemented a daily cap, understandable since gold unlocks everything in the game. However, prepare for a long and monotonous 1v1 grind against the computer or random opponents, whom you can't even communicate with.

98,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"Being the third installment in the trilogy, I'll address the negatives first. I quite dislike prequels as they technically move backwards in a story rather than forwards (an issue for every prequel). Granted, they offer more story-wise. The combat feels imprecise and doesn't capture the sharpness Arkham City managed to achieve. As of this recommendation (26/10/2013), there is a game-breaking bug that prevents a side mission from ever being completed (main story unaffected). Some gadgets have a ridiculous hotkey that requires your hand to travel across the keyboard to use. It might sound insignificant, but during combat, it could potentially disrupt your combo."

The boss fights are excellent, weapons feel impressive (perhaps not as great as those in Doom 2016, but still solid), and enemies aren't too tough if you're adept with elemental features and upgrades. The upgrade system is well-balanced, and once you get familiar with it, it isn't too tedious. The elemental features and limited ammo encourage varied weapon use. There are many cool, unique weapons that remain viable throughout most of the game. The music is fantastic, particularly the main theme and Stan Bush’s contributions."

My player is an outside scorer, PG, 1.71m, has maxed stats, and already obtained all necessary perks. Ok, now tell me, why does the shooting skill depend on a person's height? Why can a person who is 1.74m not become as good at shooting as someone who is 1.71m? I'm 1.87m in real life, made my first player with this height, and noticed I cannot reach a skill higher than 89. Why? That's pure discrimination! And why doesn’t the game tell me that before I create a character, or even when I reach the skill limit after weeks of playing?!?"
101,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"I think this Assassin's Creed perfected the mechanics across all areas (ship battles, sailing, fishing, parkour, etc.). I felt much more connected to this character as well. The story begins quite rough but improves significantly as you play (I think this is true for every AC game personally). Edward was a very interesting character, as were all the side characters. I felt all the collectibles actually mattered in this AC game, unlike in previous ones. Perhaps it's because they seemed to have a bigger purpose. They definitely weren't required, but they were fun to collect, and you were rewarded in a very balanced way."
102,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"While I personally cannot recommend this game, it wasn't entirely terrible. The gunplay is decent, provided you have the funds to purchase gun parts, which is my main complaint: it's pay-to-win. If I could move past that, the game would be enjoyable, as the hardsuit is fun to use and HRV is an excellent idea. I'd choose this game over any Call of Duty title, but its pay-to-win microtransaction model is off-putting for me. If you are comfortable with this model, then by all means, enjoy it. But if you're like me and dislike pay-to-win games, just let this one go; it's not our cup of tea."
103,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"While not perfect, this game has been highly enjoyable. The save system and possibility of sudden death can lead to some frustration. I'm on my first playthrough and unfortunately lost my main character around hour 10 of 20ish. I would have really liked a save to reload at that point. I've since picked up a 3rd party mod/save tool to avoid catastrophic failures. Additionally, the aiming reticule is small and the zoom feels underpowered. Despite these issues, it's been a blast. I'm not typically a zombie fan, but the combination of strategy, missions, and first-person shooter/beat-'em-up elements is great. I've been playing it as often as I can get away... Just one more mission, just one more supply run—or I'm running away and want to get safe before shutting the game down."
104,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"An absolutely great strategy game! Having played every other wargame (European Escalation and ALB), I must say this one fits well. The number of units is impressive. Not sure exactly how many there are, but there's a ton! The graphics are beautiful, the sounds are great, and the gameplay is epic. The in-game chat box at the main menu is very entertaining, and I'm not kidding. However, if anyone thinks this game is 'easy', or if you are new to the strategy genre, it could take some time to master. Don't get upset; you will lose a lot of units. Just make sure you plan ahead and always have anti-air and anti-tank."
105,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"I was skeptical about this game before I played it. Wasn't even sure about purchasing it. I didn't know, the whole portal gun and portals concept seemed odd, even though I enjoy science fiction. How wrong I was. The jokes and voice acting in this game are phenomenal. Simply amazing. It's not cheesy (okay, it's sometimes cheesy). Each story character has their own sense of humor and distinct personality. And the level design? It's just fantastic. By the way, I never played the first Portal game. One of these days, I'm planning to if I can spare the time. I would never have considered it if I hadn't experienced the sequel."

""Yes, this is a nostalgic experience for those in their thirties who remember (at least in the UK) enduring the ever-annoying Timmy Mallett just for the five-minute Transformers cartoon. The voice actors for Optimus, Megatron, Bumblebee, and many others return, and are instantly recognizable. The distinctive cartoon transformation sound is present. Graphically, the cel-shaded presentation is flawless and very, very Generation One. Beyond that, it's actually an enjoyable game. The combat mechanics are exceptionally well executed. Transforming mid-fight is often essential and seamlessly integrated into combos, making it unlike High Moon's excellent War for/Fall of Cybertron games. Another difference is the strong emphasis on melee combat, though some enemies (e.g., Seekers) require switching to a ranged blaster."
108,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"I downloaded the game and played it for a while, and it was nothing special. I spent more time trying to log in than actually playing. There's a bug where it says there's an update to the terms of service and whenever you click 'accept' it just pops up again. You have to restart the client for it to work. That's not so bad, but why do I need to link my Steam and Gface accounts? They say it's for DLC, but why is that necessary? It's irreversible, so now I know that a company I don't care about has access to my Steam information. The game itself is so-so.

In my opinion, this is an excellent and fun game, although the format might be somewhat frustrating (where the free-roam city area repopulates with new enemies every time you progress the story). I particularly enjoyed the 'dual play' segments (where you can play Batman plus one more), and the ability to use the controller for most segments of the game. However, the mouse and keyboard use for the tank combat segments was greatly appreciated. Driving your Batmobile around the free-roam city, including when chasing the APC commanders, is ultimately enjoyable once you figure out how to use the brakes to skid around corners. Once you master that, driving around the city is really quite enjoyable!"

It looks, sounds, and plays wonderfully with excellent FPS mechanics, an engaging story, compelling characters, flawless voice acting, and a powerful soundtrack. However, it's not for the faint-hearted; some cutscenes are quite intense and vivid. Yet, when a game is this impressive, its flaws become more noticeable, and here's what I found: - No SLI support, which was frustrating. I had to shelve the game until I upgraded my card, as it ran poorly on my old dual-GPU GTX 590. Ensure you have a decent single GPU card. - Irritatingly, small obstacles are often unclimbable."

Can't tell you how many times I hear new players complain about getting killed really fast. Oh, God forbid you get shot in the face and die. It's not like that doesn't happen in real life or anything. Edit: Okay, so I've been playing this game for a while now. Thrown all kinds of money at it. One of the best MP games around.

The gameplay is solid, the art design is stunning, the music is high quality and fitting, the story/world has captured my interest, and the puzzles are engaging. But the best aspect of this game is the comedy. If you've played any RPG since the dawn of video game RPGs, you'll appreciate the various jokes, parodies, and references; even if you’ve never played an RPG before, you’ll still find the humor enjoyable. If you played Final Fantasy VII or X, you absolutely need to try this game. Without giving too much away, I had to actually stop playing after two hours to give my cheeks a break from laughing and smiling so much. What a delight so far."
115,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"I'm really sorry. I try to be supportive of free-to-play games and indie developers, but I genuinely didn't enjoy this game. The description sounded perfect for me, but the execution didn't resonate. I love puzzle and exploration games, yet I found this one completely unintuitive. Even after researching how to progress, I just didn't find the gameplay fun. It also lacks a pause button, or if it has one, I never found it. Given that many sequences are timed, this seems like a critical oversight. I also feel this game is more cut scene than actual gameplay, leaving me drumming my fingers often."
116,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"This game... Phew, where to even start. It was absolutely beautiful; from story to graphics, I was hooked. The story wasn't just any story but actually felt like I was that person, trying to figure out what came next in the tale my character was telling. Gameplay was great, and I learned a lot about myself through this game (mainly my fear of heights, which I never had a problem with until the ice caverns). My gut churned the whole time, but I pushed through for Uncle Fred! If you guys made a DLC or second game, I would be the first to buy it and recommend it to everyone I know.

In previous games, you followed Earth's timeline through historical periods like the Stone Age, Medieval Age, and Modern Age. However, this game sets you in the future on a mission to colonize a new planet. What I enjoy is that 2K took a fresh approach and introduced new mechanics such as the Affinity System and Orbital Layer. However, these new mechanics can be overwhelming at times. What I think could be improved is incorporating additional artwork, such as the environment experienced when communicating with another leader."
118,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"Great game! Tons of replayability and an incredibly fun zombie survival game! Definitely in my top 5 zombie games. Edit: After playing 60+ hours, I can honestly say this is one of the better, more ""realistic"" zombie games. It's very much designed like a survival horror as you must conserve ammo, heal your wounds, take pills when infected, etc. Also, I find zombies to be well animated for a free-to-play game. P.S.: I would recommend playing with 1 or 2 friends, but the community is super friendly and you can usually make friends or chat with people in the chat or via voice comms."
119,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"02/07/2014 - It's unfortunate I can't fully recommend or enjoy this game. From the short time I've played it, I know I'd be hooked if it weren't for two major issues. No Aussie servers - one red bar puts you at a severe disadvantage and creates unbearable lag. Mind you, I played through the offline training mode, and it was stuttering and lagging as well (how does that even happen?). Couple that with the poor ping, and it just ruins the game experience. Everything glitches like crazy - the menus, backgrounds, training, and in-game. I've never had this happen before with this card and thought it might not like my OC. Set my GPU back to stock, and sure enough, it didn't help."
120,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"Very late last night, I finished this. The story isn't very deep or interesting, but what makes it stand out is the storytelling. The atmosphere is full to the brim, and the many collectibles do a great job of fleshing it out. I learned a lot about the world of Batman, so it was a little disappointing that so few bosses were in the game. Oh well, there are enough future games to rectify that. The combat is the right amount of challenge, though it's more on the easy side. Leveling up Batman wasn't very satisfying. It's the gadgets you upgrade and acquire during the campaign that add nice new gameplay mechanics. Accessing previously unreachable places offers a nice sense of progression."
121,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"'To the Moon' is no mere game; it is a veritable experience, and one of the best of my life. Think Telltale's ""The Walking Dead"" is sad? Well, it's no match for 'To the Moon'! Never before have I been so depressed yet fulfilled over something purely fictional. This masterpiece represents the pinnacle of storytelling, in my opinion, and the soundtrack is a gorgeously charming and perfect accompaniment. Yes, the controls are a bit finicky, and the gameplay is not the strong point, but the story is so fantastic that I did not care one bit. Plus, the humor of the game is great and does not intrude upon the distinguished nature of the story. And the Doctor Who references are endless."
122,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"Bastion is a brilliant game with a captivating storyline. Set after a calamity, you begin to rebuild on the bastion. The game offers plenty of choices, from what to build for advantages to choosing weapons and power-ups, as well as which drinks to use for bonus effects. The art style and music are fantastic—everything is vibrantly colorful at times, challenging the notion that the apocalypse must be dull. Best of all, the game features narration based on your actions; if you pick up a weapon and then swap it for another in the armory, the narration will comment on your decision to switch to the new weapon."
123,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"I first purchased this game during its early development, when the only currency was spacebux, and there was no 'tech tree.' This was when the game was truly enjoyable. All the guns at that time were equally overpowered, so there were no imbalance issues; everyone could defeat anyone at any moment. Additionally, the game used to provide you with unlimited gun slots and five loadouts. You'd expect that for a game boasting 'bajillions of guns,' they would at least offer more than six weapon slots and three loadouts before requiring payment for extras. At one point, I had about three pages of guns and was planning new ideas for more, because personally, that's where I found the fun."
124,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"This game was a surprising gem. One often encounters rave reviews of certain products that can be misleading. In this instance, however, the reviews accurately reflect the fun of this neat little game. It is an intriguing mix between a classic 2D platformer and a MOBA, and it does so with style. I found myself enjoying characters that I typically wouldn't in other MOBA games. Initially, I expected this preference to persist but decided to try a melee tank anyway. I was pleasantly surprised by the outcome and ended up exploring more as they were unlocked through playing. The art style and interface are oddly charming. Consequently, I now use one of the characters as my avatar and a wallpaper from creating a card set for the game."
125,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"I just started playing, but I love this game. I put on my headphones and lose myself in the game for hours at a time. It's been a while since a game has had that effect on me. The music sets the mood, the sound effects are spot on, and the controls are perfect. I look forward to every combat encounter, and they've optimized combat extremely well. I had my doubts about the naval combat system, but it is so much fun to lay waste to multiple fleets at a time! The only way to lose in this game is to fail to retreat. If the combat looks overwhelming, just get out of there, regroup, and counter-assault. Thanks, devs, for an amazing experience!"
126,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"The reboot of the Devil May Cry franchise has introduced many changes to the series, especially for the protagonist, Dante. While fans of the original series might be upset by changes to their beloved character, it's undoubtedly for the better, and this new game by Ninja Theory proves it. DmC serves as the perfect entry point for newcomers to the series. It unveils the origins of an arrogant, cynical Dante and chronicles his journey from cynicism to selflessness. Throughout, the game weaves a clear narrative arc for the new Dante, making him a compelling character to watch. The story follows Dante as he's introduced to the corrupt world he once chose to ignore."
127,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"Where do I begin with this absolutely beautiful game? Its story is utterly charming. So much detail is invested in it, and it is a delightful mix of happiness, bad puns, annoying dogs, and secrets. It is serious when necessary but not a stranger to humorous moments. The character design is exceptional, with a variety of characters boasting distinct personalities and secrets. It stands out from other RPGs by allowing players not to kill anyone, an uncommon concept in RPGs. With abundant inspiration from EarthBound, one of the finest RPGs I have encountered, you know it will be exceptional. It effortlessly boasts the best soundtrack I've heard in ages."
128,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"I recommend this solely because it's free and might offer a more enjoyable experience for others. As for my experience, the game didn't impact me. Half the story relies on shock value. I wasn't shocked or emotionally moved in any way. Perhaps I'm desensitized, or it was too simple to evoke a reaction. The other half of the game attempts to portray (literally) a person in mental decline, dealing with obsession, hallucination, depression, and other issues. In theory, it's a cool concept. However, the game took me just 10 minutes to finish, and that's with reading and absorbing every bit of information I could."

It's an amazing way to test your mind while still being fun. Although this game isn't as story-heavy, it did give birth to one of the most popular games of 2011. I still play this game and beat it when I am feeling bored and love to see what gave birth to a legend. Gameplay: Portal's gameplay is quite simple to explain, at least. You use portals to your advantage, along with buttons that activate parts of the puzzle. Two buttons are in the game: one that you press and one that requires a cube."

Since most reviews are about specs, I'll include mine: i5 6600k (~200€), Radeon RX480 (~200€), Z170 Pro-Gaming (~150€), 16GB DDR4 RAM (~70€). ~650€ is within the medium price range, though, granted, this rig is quite new.

Divinity: Dragon Commander comes very close to these borders of my personal favorite RTS game. Combine this with a significant Risk-like grand strategy mode and there, it hits the spot. I try not to be overly biased due to the fact that this game allows you to turn into a dragon, aiding your troops by supporting, attacking, and even commanding unit production, direction, and spawning simultaneously. Honestly, I do like the complex RTS games nowadays. Think of Civilization V and so on. However, such games attempt to cram intricate mechanics, charts, and resources all into one complex game mode."

The graphics are excellent for a retro title and the music is superb; together, they form truly beautiful and impactful moments. The script ranges from comedic to dramatic, heartbreaking to hopeful, sometimes all at once, all while turning RPG tropes on their head. And all of this without even touching on the world, characters, story, or gameplay... I could write entire pages about it. But instead, I'll just say this: if you like RPGs, play this game. If you like video games, play this game. If you have seven free hours before your death, play this game."

There is a fairly steep learning curve to the game's mechanics, which I am still trying to master; however, this breadth of strategy allows you numerous ways to achieve goals and exploit certain situations. The game, in my opinion, is nearly infinitely replayable. I find myself captivated in every session I play, regardless of how the playthrough is progressing."

After these enjoyable hours, you'll notice that what's left is repetition in its combat, enemies, and gameplay. The major highlight is that the developers work hard and provide semi-frequent updates that generally include plenty of content, from sweeping changes to some of the game’s systems, new warframes, and other tweaks/features. It's a good game to play casually. Though I doubt it will hold your attention beyond a few months unless you really enjoy grinding. The upside is that the game is free, so I'd recommend giving it a try. If you're looking for a quick fix, try it out."

Sadly, it's far from it. In this game, you go around absorbing increasingly larger objects to grow bigger and absorb even more. However, the gameplay isn't as smooth as it could be, the levels lack creativity, and what exists is a surreal horror show. I don't mean an entertaining horror show, but one that makes you feel rather depressed and reconsider whether life is all it should be.

Slightly disappointed, but still optimistic, I continued to see what I could do. I'll give the game credit; the character customization, although limited, is pretty fun to explore. It's the only time you can choose whether to wear your head or not in a campaign. Literally."

Settlements interfere with the narrative to the point that you'll find yourself resenting babysitting them instead of advancing the plot. Some keys are hardcoded and cannot be rebound. Bugs abound. My pipboy vanished permanently at one point, and I had to research console commands to retrieve it. You don't even have to earn power armor—it's basically handed to you from the start, and power cores are abundant in trader shops. The value of power armor has significantly decreased from previous Fallout games. The story is mediocre; everything about this game is average, except it doesn't crash every 10 minutes like Fallout 3. It's very stable compared to Fallout 3. Is it better than Fallout 3?

Single hits to the chest, neck, or head from rifle-caliber weapons usually result in death unless they just graze you. Rounds drop over distance, and short, controlled bursts are required if you wish to remain on target. There is no magical ammunition pool. If you reload halfway through your magazine frequently, you will have a pouch full of partially full mags. You can't run forever. If you sprint for a while, your aim will suffer as you gasp heavily until you catch your breath. Rest your weapon on your elbows while prone or on a windowsill to steady your aim.

As for XCOM 2, I love it; the game plays well for me on medium, and I am running a GTX 560 with 2GB of VRAM. Initially, the game set itself to high, and it was a bit sluggish, though not to the point of being unplayable. However, when I dropped it to medium, it smoothed out.

Lee Miller scored within the opening 60 seconds, heading over Colin Meldrum and into the net from a Jamie McAllister free kick. McAllister himself scored the second by meeting Saulius Mikoliunas' cross at the back post, putting the game beyond the visitors. Craig Easton headed in a controversial goal after an hour, but Hearts held firm. The opening goal came after Gus Bahoken had clumsily fouled Miller 35 yards from goal. McAllister floated the free kick into the Livi box and Miller outjumped the static visiting defense to loop his header from 10 yards over Meldrum. With just 10 minutes on the clock, the home side doubled their lead. Mikoliunas sprinted down the right and crossed to the back post where McAllister raced in to head past Meldrum."

Beyond coaxing larger and more tangible objects into a quantum behavior regime, this new capability has inspired ideas for using mechanical oscillators in the processing and communication of quantum information and as precision force sensors operating beyond the standard quantum limit. However, the effectively linear interaction between motion and light or electricity precludes access to a broader class of quantum states of motion, such as cat states or energy squeezed states. Indeed, early optomechanical proposals noted the possibility of escaping this restriction by creating strong quadratic coupling of motion to light.

Furthermore, most existing detectors focus on detection accuracy, which is not well-aligned with the goal of maintaining the trustworthiness of product evaluations. To address these challenges, we formulate a minimax game where the spammers and spam detectors compete with each other on their practical goals, which are not solely based on detection accuracy.

Among this family, we identify a tracking solution with a single parameter to control the fidelity of the transfer, the population of the excited state, and robustness.

Each local minimum involves a non-overlapping combination of fitting multiple Gaussians to a single true component and fitting a single Gaussian to multiple true components.

In practice, due to the exponentially increasing Hilbert space dimension with respect to system size, constructing an efficient entanglement witness for general multipartite entangled states is very challenging. For $n$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-like states, the most robust witness scheme requires $n+1$ local measurement settings and can tolerate up to $1/2$ white noise.

These can disrupt the axial and equatorial symmetry of the Kerr metric and exhibit a significantly richer multipolar structure, providing a means to constrain fuzzball models phenomenologically. We find numerical evidence suggesting that all multipole moments are typically greater (in absolute value) than those of a Kerr black hole with the same mass and spin. Current measurements of the quadrupole moment of black-hole candidates could impose only mild constraints on fuzzballs, while future gravitational-wave detections of extreme mass-ratio inspirals with the space mission LISA will enhance these bounds significantly."

In practice, humans often specify long-term edges. Human-specified edges can be both costly to produce and suboptimal for the downstream task. To address these issues, we propose a model based on temporal point processes and variational autoencoders that learns to infer temporal attention between nodes by observing node communication. As temporal attention drives between-node feature propagation, leveraging the dynamics of node interactions to learn this key component offers more flexibility while simultaneously avoiding issues associated with human-specified edges."

The equivariant stable homotopy groups of every global spectrum form a global Mackey functor, so the splittings imply that certain long exact homotopy group sequences decompose into short exact sequences.

In this case, carefully measuring the azimuthal decay angles ""resurrects"" the interference, recouping sensitivity to the ""non-interfering"" operators. We explore these signatures in detail and find that the EFT uncertainties associated with higher-dimensional operators are uniquely well-suppressed by the construction of an asymmetry variable, which is only generated by these non-interfering operators, relegating the effects of higher-dimensional, interfering operators to the same status as statistical errors in this observable."
216,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,paper_abstract,"Causal inference from observational data is a key goal of many analyses in the health and social sciences. However, academic statistics has often been skeptical of analyses with a causal objective. The introduction of the term ""data science"" offers a historic chance to redefine data analysis to naturally include causal inference from observational data. Like others before, we categorize the scientific contributions of data science into three task classes: description, prediction, and counterfactual prediction (including causal inference). An explicit classification of data science tasks is necessary to discuss the data, assumptions, and analytics needed for each task. We argue that failing to adequately describe the role of expert knowledge in data analysis is a source of widespread misunderstandings about data science."
217,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,paper_abstract,"The weak gravity conjecture (WGC) demands the existence of superextremal particles in any consistent quantum theory of gravity. The standard belief is that these particles are introduced to ensure that extremal black holes are either unstable or marginally stable, but it is not clear what is wrong if this doesn't occur. This note shows that, for a generic Einstein quantum theory of gravity in AdS, exact stability of extremal black branes is in tension with rigorously proven quantum information theorems about entanglement entropy. Avoiding the contradiction leads to a nonperturbative version of the WGC, which reduces to the usual statement at weak coupling. The argument is general, and it does not rely on either supersymmetry or a particular UV completion, assuming only the validity of Einsteinian gravity, effective field theory, and holography."
218,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,paper_abstract,"Understanding how strongly correlated two-dimensional (2D) systems can give rise to unconventional superconductivity with high critical temperatures is one of the major unsolved problems in condensed matter physics. Ultracold 2D Fermi gases have emerged as clean and controllable model systems to study the interplay of strong correlations and reduced dimensionality, but direct evidence of superfluidity in these systems has been elusive. Here, we demonstrate superfluidity in an ultracold 2D Fermi gas by moving a periodic potential through the system and observing no dissipation below a critical velocity \(v_{\rm c}\). We measure \(v_{\rm c}\) as a function of interaction strength and find a peak in the crossover regime between bosonic and fermionic superfluidity. Our measurement establishes ultracold Fermi gases as a powerful tool for studying the influence of reduced dimensionality on correlated superfluids."
219,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,paper_abstract,"Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are mathematical models used across many disciplines such as climatology, bioinformatics, and chemical engineering due to their intuitive appeal for modeling. Despite the wide application of ODEs, the frequent absence of analytic solutions makes it challenging to estimate parameters from data, particularly when models involve numerous variables and parameters. This paper proposes a Bayesian ODE parameter estimation algorithm that is both fast and accurate, even for complex models. The method approximates an ODE model with a state-space model using equations from a numerical solver, allowing for swift estimation by avoiding computation of a complete numerical solution in the likelihood. The posterior is derived using a variational Bayes method, specifically, the approximate Riemannian conjugate gradient method (Honkela et al.)."

Our findings indicate that the differential conductance and induced pairing amplitudes are strongly influenced by the angle between the junction direction in real space and the axis separating the Weyl nodes in momentum space. We identify the effect of a chiral chemical potential, namely, the electron population imbalance between Weyl nodes of opposite chirality, on the transport characteristics of the junction. Notably, we observe a net spin polarization of Cooper pairs generated via Andreev reflection in the two WSM regions. This spin polarization is opposite in the two WSM regions and highly sensitive to the chirality imbalance and excitation energy."

Importantly, it offers a way to grade the voltage drop across high voltage insulators, thereby increasing the maximum operational voltage that can be applied without surface flashover. However, a concern is the long-term stability of the implantation-induced conductivity, especially if the implanted metal species oxidizes easily. Here we report on our study of the long-term behavior of the surface conductivity of titanium-implanted alumina. The results indicate that after an initial drop of up to 40% in the first few weeks post-implantation, the conductivity shows only a very slow decrease of about 10% over the following year."
222,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,paper_abstract,"We introduce a novel Skyrme-like conserved current in the effective theory of pions and vector mesons based on the concept of hidden local symmetry. The associated charge is equivalent to the Skyrmion charge for any smooth configuration. Additionally, there exist singular configurations that can be identified as \( n_f=1 \) baryons charged under the new symmetry. With this identification, the vector mesons act as the Chern-Simons vector fields residing on the quantum Hall droplet that forms the \( n_f=1 \) baryon. We propose that this current is the correct effective expression for the baryon current at low energies. This proposal provides a unified picture for the two types of baryons, allowing them to transform continuously into one another naturally. Moreover, Chern-Simons dualities on the droplet can be interpreted through Seiberg-like duality between gluons and vector mesons."

We theoretically study how the superposition of both effects impacts superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator/superconductor junctions' transport properties. Transverse momentum-dependent skew tunneling of Cooper pairs through the spin-active ferromagnetic insulator interface creates sizable transverse Hall supercurrents, which we refer to as anomalous Josephson Hall effect currents. We generalize the Furusaki-Tsukada formula, originally established to quantify usual (tunneling) Josephson current flows, to evaluate the transverse current components and demonstrate that their amplitudes are widely adjustable through the spin-orbit coupling strengths or the superconducting phase difference across the junction. As a clear spectroscopic fingerprint of Josephson junctions, well-localized subgap bound states form around the interface."

(2020), that dipoles are as crucial to the dynamics of decaying two-dimensional turbulence as individual vortex cores, it is found that the kinetic energy of this flow is carried by elongated streams formed by the concatenation of dipoles. Vortices separate into a group of small fast-moving cores and another group of larger slowly moving ones, which can be described as 'frozen' into a slowly evolving 'crystal.' The kinematics of both groups are very different, and only the former is self-similar. The latter is responsible for most kinetic energy of the flow, and its vortices form the dipoles and the streams. Mechanisms are discussed for the growth of this slow component."

Typically, the runtime of quantum algorithms in this framework is characterized by the quantum hitting time: the time required for the quantum walk to locate a vertex of interest with high probability. In this article, we offer improved upper bounds for the quantum hitting time applicable to several ctqw-based quantum algorithms. Specifically, we apply our techniques to the glued-trees problem, enhancing their hitting time upper bound by a polynomial factor: from $o(n^5)$ to $o(n^2\log n)$. Moreover, our methods also facilitate an exponential improvement in the dependence on precision for the continuous-time quantum walk-based algorithm to find a marked node on any ergodic, reversible Markov chain by Chakraborty et al."

Dry (or ""loss-cone"") EMRIs, previously considered the main EMRI sources for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, are primarily produced by multi-body scattering in the nuclear star cluster and gravitational capture. In this letter, we highlight an alternative EMRI formation channel: wet EMRI formation assisted by the accretion flow around accreting galactic-center massive black holes (MBHs). In this channel, the accretion disk captures stellar-mass black holes initially moving on inclined orbits and then drives them to migrate towards the MBH. This process significantly boosts the formation rate of EMRIs in such galaxies."

This challenge is known as the new user cold-start problem and is vital for a company's growth and even survival.

It has also been successfully applied in wireless communications, even though current radio systems are well-understood and optimal algorithms exist for many tasks. While some improvements have been made by learning individual parts of a receiver, a more effective approach is to jointly learn the entire receiver. This, however, often results in a challenging nonlinear problem, for which the optimal solution is difficult to implement. To address this, we propose a deep fully convolutional neural network, deeprx, which processes the entire receiver pipeline from frequency domain signal stream to uncoded bits in a 5G-compliant manner. We ensure accurate channel estimation by constructing the input of the convolutional neural network in a very specific way using both data and pilot symbols."
229,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,paper_abstract,"Mutation-based fuzzing typically employs an initial set of non-crashing seed inputs (a corpus) to create new inputs via mutation. A corpus of potential seeds often includes thousands of similar inputs. This lack of diversity can result in wasted fuzzing efforts due to exhaustive mutations from available seeds. To mitigate this, fuzzers offer distillation tools (e.g., afl-cmin) to select the smallest subset of seeds triggering the same range of instrumentation data points as the full corpus. Common practice suggests minimizing seed quantity and cumulative size leads to more efficient fuzzing, which we explore systematically. We present results from 34+ CPU-years of fuzzing using five distillation approaches to understand their impact on finding bugs in real-world software."

The agents are divided into several groups, each of which has agents with similar (isomorphic) state transition structures, allowing them to be relabeled into the same template. Based on this template, we design a scalable supervisor whose state size and computational cost remain independent of the number of agents, even under partial observation. This scalable supervisor doesn't require recomputation regardless of how many agents are added to or removed from the system. We extend our earlier results to partial observation by proposing sufficient conditions for safety and maximal permissiveness of the least restrictive scalable supervisor at the template level. An example is provided to illustrate the proposed scalable supervisory synthesis."

An efficient approach for ENF estimation is introduced with temporal windowing using the filter-bank Capon spectral estimator. A type of Gohberg-Semencul factorization of the model covariance matrix is utilized due to the Toeplitz structure of this matrix. Additionally, this approach employs, for the first time in the field of ENF, a temporal window—not necessarily rectangular—prior to spectral estimation. Krylov matrices are used for fast implementation of matrix inversions. The proposed approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods in ENF estimation when a short time window of one second is applied in power recordings. In speech recordings, the proposed approach delivers highly accurate results regarding both time complexity and accuracy."

Here, we studied the fluorescence anomalous saturating effect of the nitrogen vacancy defect in diamond. A reduction in fluorescence was observed with high-power laser excitation. This effect increased the nonlinearity of the fluorescence emission and altered the spatial frequency distribution of the fluorescence image. We employed a differential excitation protocol to extract high spatial frequency information. By modulating the power of the excitation laser, the spatial resolution of imaging was improved by approximately 1.6 times compared to confocal microscopy. Due to the simplicity of both the experimental setup and data processing, we anticipate this method can enhance the spatial resolution of sensing and biological labeling using defects in solids."

We contrast our approach with frequentist methods relying on numerical integration to show that only the Bayesian method achieves both unbiased estimation concerning the sampling design distribution and consistency with respect to the population generating distribution. Our simulations and real data example for a survey of business establishments demonstrate the utility of our approach across various modeling formulations and sampling designs.

For the first time, it was discovered that in a mesogenic polymer, unlike low-molecular-weight mesogens, the relaxation of the electric birefringence of a melt above the nematic-isotropic phase transition temperature can be described by a sum of several exponential processes, two of which are pivotal. These main processes replace each other over a temperature range of about fifty degrees. Dielectric spectroscopy also allowed the identification of two processes of orientational relaxation: the first is due to the rotation of side mesogenic groups, and the second is associated with the motion of main chain segments."

Optimizing discrete hash bits remains a primary focus within deep hashing methods.

However, this approach can cause more hash bits to become stuck in the incorrect saturated area of the activation functions and unable to escape. We refer to this issue as the ""dead bits problem (dbp)."" Moreover, the current quantization loss exacerbates dbp.

The conventional scenario suggests an initially circular and narrow belt of planetesimals at semi-major axis $a$, whose eccentricity is heightened to $e_f$ after the gas disc disperses due to secular perturbations from an eccentric planet, resulting in a belt of width $2ae_f$. With a slight modification of this scenario, narrower belts can emerge if the planetesimals are initially eccentric, possibly due to earlier planet perturbations during the gas-rich protoplanetary disc phase. Alternatively, a primordial eccentricity could arise from instabilities that increase the disc eccentricity, without the need for any planets."

This few-get-richer effect emerges in settings with few distinct classes of items (e.g., left-leaning versus right-leaning news sources), and items are ranked based on popularity. We demonstrate analytically that the few-get-richer effect arises when people tend to click on top-ranked items and have varied preferences for item classes.

With carefully designed patterns, our proposed pruning unprecedentedly and consistently achieves accuracy enhancement and improved feature extraction on different DNN structures and datasets. Our pattern-aware pruning framework also achieves simultaneous pattern library extraction, pattern selection, pattern and connectivity pruning, and weight training.

It wasn't until a few games into the tournament that a friend remarked, ""Why does it feel like everything I'm seeing is commercials for makeup, household cleaning products, and diets?"
260,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,speech,"I want to talk about the future of money. Let's begin with a story about a culture in Micronesia in the early 1900s, called the Yap. I mention the Yap because their form of money is fascinating. They used limestone discs called rai stones. The Yap didn't actually move these rai stones around or exchange them as we do with coins, because rai stones can be quite massive. The largest is about four tons and 12 feet across. So, the Yap just kept track of who owned each stone. There's a story about sailors who were transporting a stone across the ocean when they encountered trouble, and the stone fell in."
261,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,speech,"You've been accused of a crime you did not commit. It’s nearly impossible to prove your innocence. If you insist you’re innocent anyway, you’ll likely be found guilty and executed. But if you confess, apologize, and implicate others for good measure, you’ll go free. Do you give a false confession—or risk a public hanging? This was the choice facing those accused of witchcraft in the village of Salem, Massachusetts, between February 1692 and May 1693. They were victims of paranoia about the supernatural, misdirected religious fervor, and a justice system that valued repentance over truth. Salem was settled in 1626 by Puritans, a group of English Protestants. Life was strict and isolated for the people of Salem. Battles with their Native American neighbors and groups of French settlers were commonplace."
262,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,speech,"Currently, hundreds of thousands await critical organs like kidneys, hearts, and livers on transplant lists, hoping for lifesaving donations. Unfortunately, donor organs are far too scarce to meet this demand. What if, instead of waiting, we could create brand-new, customized organs from scratch? This is the idea behind bioprinting, an innovative branch of regenerative medicine under development. While the ability to print complex organs remains out of reach, simpler tissues such as blood vessels and tubes for nutrient and waste exchange are already within our grasp. Bioprinting is akin to 3D printing, a method that layers material to construct a three-dimensional object one slice at a time."
263,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,speech,"Good afternoon. I'm proud to be here at TEDxKrakow. I'll try to discuss a phenomenon that is transforming the world: people power. I'll begin with an anecdote, or for those who love Monty Python, a Monty Python-like sketch. Here it is: It is December 15, 2010. Someone offers you a bet: you will look into a crystal ball, seeing an accurate future, and you must share it with the world. Okay, curiosity killed the cat, so you accept the bet and peer into the crystal ball. One hour later, you're in a building of national TV, on a top show, recounting the story."
264,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,speech,"We begin in 1964. Bob Dylan, 23 years old, sees his career reaching its pinnacle. He's named the voice of a generation and creates classic songs at an astounding rate. However, a small group of dissenters claims Dylan is stealing songs. Fast forward to 2004. Brian Burton, aka Danger Mouse, takes the Beatles' ""White Album"" and combines it with Jay-Z's ""The Black Album"" to create ""The Grey Album."" ""The Grey Album"" quickly becomes an online sensation, prompting the Beatles' record company to send countless cease-and-desist letters for ""unfair competition and dilution of our valuable property."" Now, ""The Grey Album"" is a remix."
265,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,speech,"That's quite an obvious statement up there. I began with that thought around 12 years ago, focusing on developing countries, but you all are representing every corner of the world. If you consider a map of your own country, you'll realize that for every nation on Earth, you could mark areas as ""these are places where good teachers won't go."" Moreover, those are often the places from which trouble emerges. So we have an ironic problem — good teachers avoid the very areas where they're needed the most. I started in 1999 to tackle this issue with an experiment, which was a straightforward venture in New Delhi."
266,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,speech,"Currently, most refugees reside in cities rather than refugee camps, representing over 60 percent of the global refugee population. With the majority living in urban areas, there is a strong need for a paradigm shift and innovative thinking. Rather than wasting money on building walls, it would be better to invest in programs that empower refugees to help themselves. We always have to leave behind all our possessions but not our skills and knowledge. If allowed to lead productive lives, refugees can support themselves and contribute to the development of their host country. I was born in the city of Bukavu, South Kivu, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. I am the fifth-born in a family of 12 children."
267,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,speech,"I have two questions for you. One: whose shoulders do you stand on? And two: what do you stand for? These are two questions that I always begin my poetry workshops with because, at times, poetry can seem like a dead art form for old white men who appear to have been born to be old, like, you know, Benjamin Button or something. I ask my students these two questions, then I share my answers in these three sentences: I am the daughter of Black writers, who are descended from freedom fighters who broke their chains and changed the world. They call me. These are words I repeat as a mantra before every single poetry performance. In fact, I was doing it in the corner over there, making faces."

For about five years after graduating from a reputable liberal arts university, this was my day job. (Laughter) I was a self-employed living statue called the Eight-Foot Bride, and I love telling people I did this for a job, because everyone always wants to know, who are these performers in real life. (Laughter) Hello. I painted myself white one day, stood on a box, placed a hat or a can at my feet, and when someone came by and dropped in money, I handed them a flower — and some intense eye contact. And if they didn't take the flower, I added a gesture of sadness and longing — as they walked away."
269,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,speech,"On October 4, 1957, the world watched in awe and fear as the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the first man-made satellite, into space. This small metal sphere, less than two feet in diameter, initiated a space race between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. that would last for eighteen years and alter the world as we know it. However, Sputnik was not the first piece of human technology to reach space. That distinction belongs to the V-2 rocket used by Germany in missile attacks against Allied cities as a last-ditch effort in the final years of World War II. Although it wasn't very effective, at the end of the war, both the U.S. and U.S.S.R. captured the technology and the scientists who developed it and began using them for their own projects."

We need more ambition from all: governments, cities, businesses, investors, and people everywhere. So I'm pleased you are launching TED Countdown. Your influence and ideas can help accelerate momentum for a carbon-neutral world by 2050. That is the only way to avert the worst impacts of global heating.

272,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,speech,"Menstruation, a simple word describing a natural biological process, has been weighed down by centuries of stigma, transformed into something most of us only speak about in whispers. But why? As I speak to you right now, over 800 million women around the world are having a period. None of us would exist without it, yet it remains an ""embarrassing"" subject to broach. From my experience and that of the women around me, I can tell you it's exhausting. It's exhausting to carefully take out a brown paper bag hiding a pad, stuff it into your pocket in the middle of a class, and rush to the washroom as discreetly as possible. It's exhausting to sit through lessons and meetings, pretending to be absolutely normal while internally crying out from intense period cramps."
273,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,speech,"The world's largest and most devastating environmental and industrial project is situated in the heart of the largest and most intact forest in the world, Canada's boreal forest. It stretches across northern Canada, and in Labrador, it's home to the largest remaining wild caribou herd: the George River caribou herd, numbering approximately 400,000 animals. Unfortunately, when I was there, I couldn't find one of them, but the antlers are proof. Across the boreal, we're blessed with an incredible abundance of wetlands. Wetlands, globally, are among the most endangered ecosystems. They're absolutely critical, cleaning air and water, sequestering large amounts of greenhouse gases, and hosting a huge diversity of species."
274,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,speech,"Before the world of humans began, there was the world of the gods, filled with fields, plains, and gardens. Four brothers wandered this celestial realm. They had no family other than each other—they didn’t even know their parents. One of the brothers, Deminan, looked different from the others. His skin was covered in painful scabs, and he wondered why he alone was marked with this affliction. One day, while the supreme spirit Yaya was out in his gardens, Deminan and his brothers snuck into Yaya’s house. After feasting and exploring, they spotted a giant gourd hanging in the corner, but as they tried to look inside, they dropped it."
275,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,speech,"Seven years ago, I graduated from Berkeley with a dual degree in molecular and cell biology and linguistics. I attended a career fair on campus, where I obtained an interview with a startup called Theranos. At the time, there was limited information about the company, but what was available was impressive. Essentially, the company was developing a medical device that allowed you to run your entire blood panel with just a finger-stick. This innovation eliminated the need for a large needle in the arm for blood tests. This was intriguing not only because it was less painful, but it also had the potential to advance predictive diagnostics."
276,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,speech,"My journey to becoming a polar specialist, photographing and specializing in the polar regions, began when I was four years old. My family moved from southern Canada to northern Baffin Island, near Greenland. There, we lived with the Inuit in a tiny community of 200 people, where we were one of three non-Inuit families. In this community, we didn't have a television, computers, or radio. We didn't even have a telephone. All of my time was spent outside with the Inuit. The snow and ice were my sandbox, and the Inuit were my teachers. That's where I became truly obsessed with the polar realm."
277,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,speech,"We're seen as the organization that is the repository for failed social policy. I can't define who comes to us or how long they will stay. We get the people for whom nothing else has worked, those who have fallen through all other social safety nets. They can't manage them, so we must. That's our job: manage them, control them. Over the years, as a prison system, as a nation, and as a society, we've become very proficient at that, but it shouldn't make you happy. Today we incarcerate more people per capita than any other country in the world. We have more black men in prison today than were under slavery in 1850."
278,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,speech,"I'd like to take you on the epic quest of the Rosetta spacecraft. Escorting and landing the probe on a comet has been my passion for the past two years. To do that, I need to explain something about the origin of the solar system. Four and a half billion years ago, there was a cloud of gas and dust. In the center of this cloud, our sun formed and ignited. Along with that, what we now know as planets, comets, and asteroids formed. According to theory, when the Earth had cooled down after its formation, comets massively impacted the planet, delivering water. They probably also brought complex organic material, which may have bootstrapped the emergence of life."

You know, when we created this ""Build Back Better"" series, our thought was: how could we address issues arising from the pandemic? How could we envision rebuilding from that? But the events of this past week, the horrific death of George Floyd and the daily protests that have followed, have provided a new urgency we, of course, simply must address. Can we build back better from this? I think before we can even start to answer that question, we must first seek to understand the immensity of this moment. Whitney Pennington Rodgers: That's right, Chris."
280,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,speech,"In 1903, the President of the United States took a three-day camping trip in California’s Yosemite Valley. President Theodore Roosevelt slept among a grove of towering sequoia trees, camped during a snowstorm, and spent hours conversing around the campfire with his host and guide, conservationist John Muir. Roosevelt famously adored the outdoors, but Muir had invited him for purposes beyond camping: Yosemite was in peril. Though Yosemite became protected land in 1864, the valley faced the threat of overdevelopment in 1903. It was at the center of a decades-old struggle to reserve land for both preservation and public use—two goals easier stated than accomplished. The battle over Yosemite began with the 1849 Gold Rush, when miners surged west, seeking gold in the Sierra Nevada foothills."

(applause) My ambition was always to be a pilot, to fly a plane, to feel free in the sky, to touch the sky. But that didn't happen. Simply, I live in Gaza; there is no airport. All borders are closed on every side. We live in one of the biggest prisons in the world. The only thing I can do is just look up at the sky. On some days, we are lucky if we have electricity for four or five hours. When it's cold, we make a fire in front or on the roof of our homes."
282,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,speech,"I'm sorry, I cannot show you my face, because if I do, the bad guys will come for me. My journey started 14 years ago. I was a young reporter who had just graduated from college when I got a scoop. It was a simple story: police officers were taking bribes from street vendors. As a young reporter, I wanted to approach it differently so it would have the maximum impact, since everyone knew it was happening, yet nothing was preventing it from continuing. So, I decided to go undercover and pose as a vendor. By doing this, I was able to gather hard evidence. The impact was great; it was fantastic. This was what many call immersive journalism or undercover journalism."
283,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,speech,"One simple vitamin can reduce your risk of heart disease. Eating chocolate reduces stress in students. A new drug prolongs the lives of patients with a rare disease. Health headlines like these are published every day, sometimes making opposing claims. There can be a disconnect between broad, attention-grabbing headlines and the often specific, incremental results of the medical research they cover. How can you avoid being misled by sensational headlines? The best way to assess a headline’s credibility is to look at the original research it reports on. We’ve come up with a hypothetical research scenario for each of these headlines. Keep watching for the explanation of the first example; then pause at the headline to answer the question. These are simplified scenarios."
284,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,speech,"When I was 14, my family was in the process of adopting my little brothers from Ethiopia. One day, my mom asked, ""Which day should we choose for their birthday?"" I thought, ""The day they were born, obviously?"" It seemed like a ridiculous question. Then my mom explained, ""Well, Kristen, neither of your little brothers has a birth certificate, so how do you suggest we find out when that was?"" My mind was blown. Now, 20 years later, I'm still working on it. Instead of solving my brothers' missing birth certificates, I aim to address this issue globally. So what do birth certificates have to do with international development?"

If given the choice to opt for such an existence, would you? That's the question philosopher Robert Nozick posed through a thought experiment he called the experience machine. The experiment invites us to consider a world where scientists have developed a machine that simulates real life while guaranteeing experiences of only pleasure, never pain. The catch? You must permanently leave reality behind, but you'll scarcely notice the difference. Your experiences will be indistinguishable from reality. Life's natural ups and downs will be replaced with an endless series of highs. Sounds great, right?"

I was consulted to see a woman in her 70s—a retired English professor with pancreatic cancer. She was experiencing pain, nausea, and vomiting. We discussed these symptoms during my visit, and she inquired whether medical marijuana might help her. I reflected on my medical school education regarding medical marijuana, which took no time because I had learned absolutely nothing."

I am a woman leading a department in a male-dominated profession. Ten years ago, I decided to expand my medical knowledge by obtaining a nursing degree. This was because it became apparent that the next major threat facing not only my city but others nationwide was not the one-time disaster, where you can rush in like the cavalry, extinguish the fire, and leave, feeling like you have truly made a difference, with everything now under control."
288,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,speech,"Where does all the carbon we release go? Carbon cycles naturally, present in all living things: in the soil, oceans, atmosphere, and rocks deep underground. When plants and living things die, much of their stored carbon returns to the atmosphere until new plants grow and reabsorb it. Over millions of years, some of the carbon stored in ancient trees and sea life becomes rock, and some becomes fossil fuels: coal, oil, and natural gas. Natural events like volcanic eruptions release some of the carbon trapped in rock. Human activities, like burning fossil fuels, also release some of that prehistoric carbon. Today, humans release around 60 times more carbon than all the volcanoes on the planet each year."
289,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,speech,"Even nature's most unsavory creatures harbor vital secrets, yet who would welcome a swarm of cockroaches approaching them? One of the significant distinctions between natural and human technologies is robustness. Robust systems remain stable in challenging and unfamiliar environments. Amazingly, cockroaches can self-stabilize while traversing rough terrain. When equipped with a jet pack or subjected to disturbances like earthquakes, their remarkably adapted legs enable them to self-stabilize without relying on any brainpower. They navigate complex terrains like grass effortlessly without destabilization. We observed a new behavior where, due to their shape, they automatically roll to their side to traverse this artificial test patch of grass. Robust systems are capable of performing multiple tasks using the same structure. Here's the new behavior we've observed."

Therefore, I would like to cheer you up with one of the great, albeit largely unknown, commercial success stories of the past 20 years. Comparable, in its own very peculiar way, to the achievements of Microsoft or Google. It's an industry that has weathered the current recession with equanimity. I refer to organized crime. Now organized crime has been around for a very long time, I hear you say, and these would be wise words indeed. But in the last two decades, it has experienced unprecedented expansion, now accounting for roughly 15 percent of the world's GDP. I like to call it the global shadow economy, or McMafia, for short. So what triggered this extraordinary growth in cross-border crime?"

As a philosopher and social scientist, I have been exploring these aspects of parenthood. Today, I will share insights from talking to parents and children. I will show you that they know what matters most in a family, even when their family appears a little different."

I see all of that and a man who spent a quarter of his life in state prison—six years, to be exact—starting as a teenager on Rikers Island for an act that nearly cost a man his life. But what got me from there to here wasn't the punishment I faced as a teenager in adult prison or the harshness of our legal system. Instead, it was the learning environment of a classroom that introduced me to something I didn't think was possible for me or our justice system as a whole. A few weeks before my release on parole, a counselor encouraged me to enroll in a new college course being offered in the prison."

That's just how the media has been portraying people who look like me. One study found that 80 percent of news coverage about Islam and Muslims is negative.

And, like many 20-somethings, I expected to solve the world's problems—more specifically, the world's water problems—with my technology. I had a lot to learn.

We can convey really complex thoughts to one another. So what I'm doing right now is, I'm producing sounds with my mouth as I exhale. I'm creating tones, hisses, and puffs, and these generate air vibrations. These air vibrations travel to you, striking your eardrums, and then your brain receives these vibrations and transforms them into thoughts. I hope. (laughter) I hope that's happening.

Another thing to consider is what an honor it is, as a politician, to give a TED Talk, particularly here in the U.K., where the reputation of politics, following the expenses scandal, has sunk so low. There was even a story recently that scientists had considered actually replacing rats in their experiments with politicians. When asked, ""Why?"" they said, ""Well, there's no shortage of politicians, no one really minds what happens to them, and, after all, there are some things that rats just won’t do.""
