1,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Another week just flew by. I drove past the new house yesterday and the front window was covered in boxes. We may get the keys at closing—I’m so excited. If all goes well this week, we’ll be set for closing a week from Wednesday. I was up until after 3:00 AM last night watching movies with Bethany. There’s been a lot of movie-watching around here lately. Here’s my rundown: last night we watched *Thirteen*, a film every mother of a teen should see. It was better than I expected. Then we watched *Gigli*—yeah, it was just as bad as the reviews said, but we had to see for ourselves."
2,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Summer TV used to be a dead zone full of repeats or filler content. But now there are two great new shows, and I've been watching both religiously for the past week. *Blow Out*—the gayest concept ever that somehow features zero gay people. Hairstylist Jonathan Antin wants to open a second location for his popular West Hollywood salon, this time in Beverly Hills. Normally, no one would care—certainly not me—but as I was flipping through channels, I caught a glimpse of Jonathan, equally narcissistic and dull, staring at an empty space on Rodeo Dr. declaring (loudly), ""I am going to build the greatest salon in the history of the world here!"" And I was hooked. Not since Rocco have I found such a moron so compelling to watch."
3,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"What a week... My right shoulder has tendonitis. It's right under my shoulder blade, so when I move my arm too much—especially while using a computer mouse—it hurts terribly. I can't move it much now because I was on a spree updating my website and working on other online tasks. I barely have the strength to draw anything. Lack of sleep worsens the pain. I'm not too happy right now, but I'll recover. My mom's surgery went well. Her eyesight has improved slightly; she can see blurry shapes and distinguish colors. Other than that, she's still completely blind. Hopefully, she'll fully regain her vision soon."
4,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Kindness of strangers... Attempted laundry today with the kids in tow and realized how quickly the simplest things can become a freaking ordeal. I also learned how incredibly sweet total strangers can be for no reason other than because they feel like being kind. Trust me. It wasn’t like they were trying to get into my pants or anything. I had kid drool all over me and was wearing my 'wash-day' outfit... Also, I’m not entirely sure I’ll ever bathe again, so it’s not like there was even an olfactory incentive there! I am doing two things right now: composing a post and watching the collected No Doubt videos. I’m doing both of these while sitting at my desk in my room."
5,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"So it’s 11:14pm MST, and here I sit in my bedroom fixing the personal computer of the personnel director from my job. Not that I mind doing it, but I sometimes wonder how often I end up repairing someone else’s computer as a favor. I’m glad to help and serve people this way, but where is the line between kindness and being taken advantage of? The past couple of weeks, I’ve been staying up late reading and such, so I was looking forward to turning in early—until I realized it would be wiser to return this computer to its owner first. *laugh* No rest for the weary, right? So I found myself watching *Joe Schmo 2* again tonight."
6,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Remind me, what did I write about before this? Or, a continuation in the 'Is this a date?' saga. So, after the awkward lunch, my confidence wavered, and I forgot to share a key detail. Before Pat arrives, Dustin starts talking about what a great guy Pat is and how he's trying to find him a girlfriend. I'm listening and nodding, realizing we're focusing more on setting up Dustin's best friend than chatting like strangers over pink lemonade. I excused myself to the bathroom, looked in the mirror, and silently wondered: Am I being pawned off to the other guy? Is this what's happening now?"
7,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"I would like everyone to think before they act. Actually, I'd like each and every person in the world to think before they get out of bed in the morning, and commit to thinking all day. If they're not prepared to, I'd very much prefer they climb back into bed and drift off to an eternal slumber. I'm sick to death of stupid people. No, I'm not the smartest person in the world... But I'm not talking about things that require great intellect, so I think it's fair to criticize the inanely stupid. Let's see if I can limit this rant to a few specific types, and save some for another day. Sound good? Great."
8,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Two issues with the scenario outlined in my previous post:  
1. True, Bush is stimulating the economy, but in the wrong way. Urllink Robert Rubin told NPR's Marketplace today that Bush could have achieved the same stimulus effect without the long-term debt burden by implementing different tax cuts—temporary measures targeting low- and middle-income individuals. Ah, Robert Rubin. The sound of his name is music to our ears. Quick: name one Bush administration cabinet official on the domestic side with Rubin's gravitas. Still thinking? It’ll come to you...  
2. We can't grant Republicans control solely in wartime because they've cleverly devised an endless, global ""war on terrorism."

Went to the cove to see Supernothing—they were great as usual, got to hang with Tiago :-). Saturday: worked, then went out with Joe and Rach, met up with Steve, Tiago, and Tom. Got home around 11:45 PM and woke up the next morning at 6:45 AM for a meet. Arrived a bit late but it’s fine—I nailed my floor routine without falling, placed second on floor and vault, and third on beam. Scored 29.45 all-around, which isn’t bad since my meets improve as the season progresses."
10,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Do you ever have one of those moments when you begin to reflect on life? Like you're sitting in math class, bored out of your skull, and you wonder what exactly happens in your brain that helps you understand math? Then you realize you exist and you’re in math class, questioning why. Suddenly, it strikes you—existing is incredible. And just as quickly, it hits you that this random train of thought is utterly pathetic. Ever experienced that? I hate it. You know what else I despise? Block schedules. Who would ever devise such an idea? Anyone can see that enduring a two-and-a-half-hour class in any subject is cruel and unusual punishment."

Tonight Andy beat me by a few small dollars and won the **friggin'** game, or maybe I let him win on account of him leaving in a few short hours and me wanting him to feel good on his last night here. Well, **however** the story goes, it can't compare to this **Texas-sized** headache I have at the moment. I've taken some Aleve and I must say that **it's** doing the trick.

12,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Well... Today's been a long day. We had to drive home from Indiana. I guess I'll have to be selective about what I write because I could easily take up a lot of time and space, and I just don't have the energy. First off, I have to say that camp was incredible—even better than I expected. God's been doing so much in my life lately, and it's truly amazing. I've turned over a new leaf, I suppose, but anyway, back to the beginning. We arrived at the Twiggs' house on Friday evening and stayed until we left for camp on Monday. Most of what we did was go to the fair, church, a parade, Walmart, and watch movies."

I hate that, but I'd rather get it over with than try to schedule it during the first month of my surgery rotation. I'm definitely nervous, scared, jittery—basically any synonym for 'hell no, I don’t wanna go' to school. This will be a whole new challenge for me. As a perfectionist, I love excelling at everything I do. But starting new things is tough. I hate being a pawn (like I told Cassie: 'I'll be the only pawn on the chessboard who insists on moving like a knight'), and I hate not knowing what's happening."
14,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Arun Shourie discusses how the current governor of Uttar Pradesh had warned, as early as 1996, about the looming threat of a potential 'third Islamic state' in the subcontinent. T.V. Rajeswar, the former head of the Intelligence Bureau and the incumbent governor of Uttar Pradesh, predicted this grave threat in a series of articles published in *The Hindustan Times* back in 1996. Shourie raises a pertinent question: Does the fact that you now know he, and not I—let alone Mr. Advani—wrote all this make the warnings more credible? Or do you conclude that because he wrote in this vein, T.V. Rajeswar is a closet communalist and should no longer serve as governor of Uttar Pradesh?"
15,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Attitude: bored. Mood: indifferent, but looking forward to tonight. It’s been a long, hard day in the trenches here today, folks—almost no time to write for you readers. However, it’s great to see Tigger (now Akcron) taking up the reins herself, making an appearance and discussing things :) Not much to say otherwise; yesterday was Shakespeare on the Green, a lovely play, but I had to leave before the curtain call, which was disappointing. Hopefully someday I'll see an entire Shakespeare play. But I digress. Akcron is right about the shower issues—it’s awful. As for laughing at her in the shower, you must admit, the faces people make while enduring self-torture can be pretty entertaining."
16,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"All of a sudden, for the past two days, I have been overwhelmed by terrible bouts of exhaustion. Bone-deep exhaustion. Last evening, I went home and simply slept, only waking when my mother called me around eight thirty. When I woke up, it was completely dark, and since I hadn't turned on the lights, I couldn’t tell what time or day it was. For a few seconds, there was just my mother's voice in the darkness and me struggling to grasp reality. Wonder why I'm feeling so drained... Lovely weather this morning. It was drizzling when I arrived. Although in Calcutta, I hear it's been raining for the past three days."
17,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Last night was the worst. I discarded the sweater I was knitting. I only had about 14 inches completed. I lost roughly $10 worth of yarn (it's $8 a skein). But it had too many stitches by the time I reached the armholes, and the mohair kept tangling as I worked, so frogging (ripping out rows) didn't help. The yarn kept breaking. I didn't even swear, which is rare for me. I just gloomily ripped and listened to season two of *Sex and the City* (thanks, library!). Eventually, I grew frustrated and tossed it. I suppose I could say I learned a lot while attempting this sweater."
18,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Last night in class, we discussed that week’s assigned reading, *Getting Back into Place: Toward a Renewed Study of the Place-World*, by Edward S. Casey. The first chapter explores “implacement,” while the second examines “displacement.” In the opening chapter, Casey argues that our contemporary world prioritizes time as the organizing force: we are running out of time, we have saved time, we are just in time. He contends that centering culture around place fosters a more grounded community. (This is a rough summary—disclaimer in case my professor or classmates read this post.) So far, this book is the first reading that has truly grabbed me by the proverbial shoulders."
19,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Whatever it is they put into freeze pops to make them those colors, there should be a warning: may make your life a bit bizarre. And while giggling is good, one wonders if we would have found ourselves up that fire escape drinking beer in the fierce wind had we not eaten them earlier. Finding ourselves in front of a bar sadly closed for business, we stopped to examine an office-supplies catalogue that had arrived in the mail. Lucky we did. Who could have guessed that within these pages were the deals of a lifetime? Not I, for certain. I list but a few: buy 36 permanent markers, get a stunt kite. Purchase 30 lever arch files, get a barbecue."

Senate Republicans, okay—hands up: who watched the 39-hour judicial nominations marathon last week? I know I didn’t. Well, fine—I tuned in briefly. The entire colossal waste of time was orchestrated by Republicans who, furious that Democrats wouldn’t rubber-stamp four of Bush’s extreme justices, staged a multi-day tantrum to score political points. Never mind that Democrats have already confirmed 168 of Bush’s judicial nominees—nooo, that’s insufficient for power-hungry Republicans who somehow believe they have a sweeping mandate for this absurdity."
21,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"This was a great weekend. I did a lot of god's green leaf, after a long time, I listened to a lot of Nevermore (something I should have started doing much earlier) and read extensively. I finished three books over the weekend—Bruce Sterling's *Heavy Weather*, Larry Niven's *World of Ptavvs*, and Octavia Butler's *Parable of the Sower*. *Heavy Weather* was an engaging cyberpunk romp through a near-future USA, devastated by global warming and general anarchy. While it was clever, well-paced, and altogether very convincing, I must admit that I failed to come away with any truly profound impressions about the story or the characters. Not that both aren't well constructed and vividly etched—it's a good book, but not a great one, I suppose."
22,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Because this is the aftermath. The first week back from practicum was a struggle, but it is only in the second week that the smoke has really started to clear. Post-practicum trauma was a hidden epidemic that is only now coming to light. I was stricken, but the eventual meeting with the course coordinator allowed me to release my burden, and by doing so, I have prevented another person from being stuck with such a pedagogically deficient practicum school. Yesterday (Monday), I bumped into another aggrieved classmate who was determined to warn the student assigned to her school in the next practicum about how terrible it would be. I calmed her down and suggested we speak to the administrator first."
23,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Well, things are incredibly busy here at times...but there's always time for stress-relieving activities. I've found that I'm terrible at 8-ball and ping pong! Rick (the Canuck) beats me regularly—we have a ping pong table in the front lobby of our building, so there's always time for a quick game. Last night I joined an 8-ball tournament at the Hot Spot (our recreation tent, complete with a popcorn machine, multiple TVs, a jukebox, DVD rentals, a pool table, dartboard, and the ever-present ping pong table). Anyway, I was doing well throughout my entire game—until I scratched on the eight ball ;( Still, I had a great time—the highlight was the two Dutch soldiers who joined the tournament."
24,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Fall 1974: I was attempting, for what felt like the 13th time, to fight my way through the second chapter of my high school algebra book. I was not then—nor am I now—a math person. I hate math. I am math-phobic. You get the picture. As I struggled to make sense of algebra, the doorbell rang. I put down my book and went to answer the door. No one was there. Great. I returned to my studies, and just as I found a glimmer of understanding buried in my subconscious, the doorbell rang again. Bam—just like that, my breakthrough vanished. I went to the door, and once again, no one was there. Just what a struggling math student needs: an uninvited practical joker."
25,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"This past week has been nothing short of exhausting. I spent Tuesday through Thursday finishing the move to my new classroom. The new room is bigger and closer to my grade-level team, which are important factors as I spend hours preparing my room for this year. Had I known about the move before the school year ended, I would have discarded many of the books and supplies I no longer use. Unfortunately, it all came with me. So this week was spent moving, unpacking, and purging extensively. I must thank my teammate Jill for helping with everything. You see, she was still teaching this month in my old room, so she and her wonderful students moved nearly my entire room for me!"

Even if I never carried your child, even if I was never married to you, even if we were never an official pair... I loved you deeply, and to this day the feeling lingers in my heart. Forever will I be reminded of the fleeting nights we shared, hearts and limbs entwined in a soul-embrace, drenched in the salty darkness of an evening by the beach... Or a kiss under the rain. Whenever I feel the sharp ache of longing, you will be there. That piece of you... Bleeding the eternal love that once lived in me... And still remains... For her."

Or let me rephrase that, the article I'm working on and its consequences aren't exactly something I'm comfortable with. Perhaps it's because I don't believe in it enough, so I can't fully grasp the essence of it. The passion behind it—the drive to question relentlessly. I grew up in a country where you don't ask questions. Really, you just don't. They shoot you for that. They imprison you under all these internal security acts. I'm not accustomed to this freedom of speech...not used to questioning openly. Sure, I'm not the easiest person to get along with."
28,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"We had an outing yesterday with my colleagues at the bank. We went to Guintubdan, La Carlota. It was the first time for most of us. We trekked to the falls, which took about 30 minutes. We were all catching our breaths—whew!—but we made it. The water was icy cold. You could feel your body going numb from the chill. We stayed less than an hour before heading to the nearby waterfalls, another 30-minute trek. But the trip was worth it because the falls were serene and the whole scene truly breathtaking. It felt like becoming one with nature. Soaking in the cold water was like communing with Mother Earth. The crisp air and water were enough to lull you to sleep."

So we have a month left before Ed leaves. I think it's starting to sink in for Ed and for all of us. It hit me a long time ago. I just hope Ed will be here for Bailey's surgery.

There's nothing better than seeing the joy on your child's face. After egg hunting, we attended church. While the Easter Bunny is fun, we ensure our kids understand the true meaning of the holidays.

And when I go upstairs after arguing with Nicole about Kelli, like I just did, and they want me to explain what's wrong. Yeah, how about you back off!?

As a non-American blogger, I've been hesitant to engage in some of these discussions, especially the debates about flags, but since I started it (the topic, not the flag-burning), I suppose I should say something. Firstly, I believe that criminalizing flag-burning is absurd. The moment you grant a symbol—any symbol—that kind of unquestioning reverence and protection, you've taken a small but crucial step toward totalitarianism.

Re: Loss of Continuity in PX Day-Ahead Auction Due to ISO Rule Changes  

The emergency tariff filing by the California ISO last Friday has negatively impacted the PX day-ahead auction market. The combination of soft and hard caps creates a complete disconnect and poses unacceptable risks for all participants. Additionally, it is unlikely to achieve the ISO’s intended reduction in real-time energy sales and procurement.  

The overall effect will be that supply will still favor the higher realized price opportunity offered by the ISO. The PX is petitioning Terry Winter of the ISO to immediately permit adjustment bids on any submitted schedule at any relevant price."

1. Relationship between the delivery point and the use of interruptible transport on Northwest Pipeline. Is the transport upstream or downstream of the delivery point? If downstream, why isn't it being contracted by EWeb?  

2. What volume is being sold daily? You mention DCQ and also reference a 20% tolerance above or below the estimated quantity. Typically, there would be no tolerance in a DCQ transaction.  

3. Is this intended to be a requirements transaction? Is the price the same for volumes exceeding the estimated quantity by up to 20%?"

Absolutely incredible—I have nothing negative to say about this game as it's surpassed my expectations and will likely exceed yours too. Smooth movement, bug-free gameplay, plenty of story/content to keep you engaged, with daily options like multiple practices, events (sponsorships), and even matches. This review focuses solely on MyCareer, and so far, it's a perfect 10/10. The facescan worked well for me (used it twice, though the first attempt gave me a comically large forehead).

97,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"Magic fans beware... Wizards is afraid to create a decent digital game. At its core, Magic: The Gathering is a social experience—a game meant to be enjoyed with friends (or frenemies), laughing, talking smack, and dropping game-winning bombs. Wizards of the Coast seems to have forgotten this. If you choose to play with friends, you can't earn gold, yet gold is essential. It's so vital that they've implemented a daily cap, understandable since gold unlocks everything in-game. But prepare for a tedious 1v1 grind against the computer or random opponents, whom you can't even chat with. If you opt to play for free, expect to spend roughly 4 hours daily for over a month, alone, just to unlock the cards."
98,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"Being the 3rd installment in the trilogy, I'll address the negatives first. I strongly dislike prequels since they technically move backward in a story rather than forward (a common issue for every prequel). Admittedly, it expands the narrative. The combat feels sloppy and lacks the precision Arkham City achieved. As of this review (26/10/2013), a game-breaking bug prevents completing a side mission (main story unaffected). Some gadgets are assigned to awkward hotkeys, forcing your hand to stretch across the entire keyboard. It might seem minor, but during combat, it can disrupt your flow."
99,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"They basically improved *Shadow Warrior* (2013). The boss fights are awesome, weapons feel great (maybe not as good as *DOOM*'s, but still solid), and enemies aren't too spongy (if you're not careless with handling elemental and upgrade mechanics). The upgrade system is well-balanced and, once you understand it, not too tedious. The elemental effects and limited ammo gently encourage you to switch between weapons. There are plenty of cool unique (key word here when comparing *SW2* to Borderlands' formula of RNG weapons) weapons that remain viable through most of the game. The music is fantastic, especially the main theme and, of course, Stan Bush's tracks."

My player is an outside scorer, pg, 1.71m, has maxed stats and already has all necessary perks. Ok, and now tell me, why does shooting skill depend on a person's height? Why can't someone who is 1.74m be as good at shooting as someone who is 1.71m? I'm 1.87m in real life, made my first player with this height and noticed I couldn't reach a higher skill than 89. Why? That's pure discrimination! And why doesn't the game tell me that before I create a character, or even when I reach the skill limit after weeks of playing?!?"
101,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"I think this Assassin's Creed nailed the mechanics on all fronts (ship battles, sailing, fishing, parkour, etc). I felt much more connected to this character as well. The story starts out rough but improves significantly as you play (I think this is true for every AC game). Edward was a fascinating character, and so were all the side characters. I felt like all the collectibles actually mattered in this AC game, unlike previous ones, perhaps because they served a greater purpose. They definitely weren't required, but they were fun to collect and rewarded you in a very balanced way."
102,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"While I personally cannot recommend this game, it wasn’t completely terrible. The gunplay is decent, so long as you have the money to purchase gun parts, which is my primary complaint with this game: it's pay-to-win. If I could overlook that, the game would be enjoyable, as the hardsuit is fun to use and HRV is a great concept. I'd choose this game over any Call of Duty title any day, but its pay-to-win microtransaction system is off-putting for me. If you’re fine with this model, then by all means, enjoy. But if you're like me and dislike pay-to-win games, just skip this one; it's not our cup of tea."
103,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"While not perfect, this game has been highly enjoyable. The save system and risk of sudden death can lead to frustration. I'm on my first playthrough and lost my main character around hour 10 of 20. Would have really appreciated a save to reload at that point. I've since picked up a third-party mod/save tool to avoid catastrophic failures. Additionally, the aiming reticle is too small and the zoom is underwhelming. With all that said, it's been a blast. I'm not usually a zombie fan, but the mix of strategy, missions, and first-person shooter/beat-em-up gameplay is fantastic. I've been playing it whenever possible... Just one more mission, just one more supply run—or I'm fleeing and need to reach safety before quitting."
104,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"An absolutely great strategy game! Having played every other wargame (European Escalation and ALB), I must say this one fits well. The number of units is impressive. I’m not sure exactly how many there are, but there's a ton! The graphics are stunning, the sounds are fantastic, and the gameplay is epic. The in-game chat box on the main menu is very entertaining too—no, I’m not kidding. However, if you think this game is 'easy,' or if you’re new to the strategy genre, it might take some time to master. Don’t get frustrated; you’ll lose many units. Just plan ahead, always bring anti-air, and anti-tank."
105,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"I was negatively biased towards this game before I played it. I wasn’t even sure about buying it. I dunno, the whole portal gun and portals concept seemed weird to me, even though I like science fiction. Boy, was I wrong. The jokes and voice acting in this game are phenomenal—just amazing. It's not cheesy (okay, sometimes it's cheesy). And each story character has their own sense of humor. Those different characters genuinely have distinct personalities. And the level design? It's just rad. By the way, I never played the first Portal game. One of these days, I’m planning to if I can spare the time. I would never have played it if I hadn’t tried the sequel."
106,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"Ok, let's discuss the pros(+) and cons(-) along with my thoughts on this game.  
+Some of the best characters  
+Good story  
+Lots of content  
+Customizable character (you can be male or female, whatever you prefer)  
+You can have relationships with most companions (yes, fangirls, you can have a love interest)  
-Bad graphics (though I don’t think graphics really matter)  
-Weird and awkward love scenes  
-Invisible walls  
-There’s one mission I found boring, but everyone has different tastes  
+/- This isn’t really bad or good, but for those who care, your protagonist can’t talk.  

Now for my thoughts: I love this game. It’s probably one of the best RPGs—or games in general—I’ve ever played. So if you’re an RPG fan, you likely already own it."
107,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"Yes, this is a nostalgia trip for thirty-somethings who remember (at least in the UK) watching the ever-irritating Timmy Mallet just for the five-minute *Transformers* cartoon. The voice actors for Optimus, Megatron, Bumblebee, and many others return, instantly recognizable. The iconic cartoon transformation sound is present. Graphically, the cel-shaded style is flawless and quintessentially Generation One. Beyond nostalgia, it's genuinely an enjoyable game. The combat mechanics are exceptionally polished. Transforming mid-fight is often essential, seamlessly integrated into combos, setting it apart from High Moon's outstanding *War for/Fall of Cybertron* games. Another standout feature is the emphasis on melee combat, though some foes (e.g., Seekers) demand switching to ranged weapons."
108,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"I downloaded the game and played it briefly, but it was nothing special. I spent more time trying to log in than actually playing. There's a bug where it claims there was an update to the terms of service, and clicking 'accept' just makes it reappear. You have to restart the client for it to work. That's not too bad, but why do I need to link my Steam and GFace accounts? They say it's for DLC, but why is that necessary? It's also irreversible, so now a company I don't care about has access to my Steam info. As for the game itself, it's mediocre. It's clearly a COD clone, yet somehow they made the gunplay worse...

110,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"I experienced no performance issues even at release, and after all these patches it runs really well. Imo, this is a truly great and fun game, although the format may be somewhat annoying (where the free-roam city area repopulates with enemies every time you progress the story). I particularly enjoyed the 'dual play' segments (where you control Batman + one more character), and the option to use a controller for most of the game but switch to mouse and keyboard for tank combat was greatly appreciated. Driving the Batmobile around the open city, especially during APC chases, is quite enjoyable once you learn to use the brakes for skidding around corners (and when you master that, cruising through the city becomes incredibly fun!)."

It looks, sounds, and plays great—excellent FPS mechanics, a compelling story, memorable characters, flawless voice acting, and a badass soundtrack. Not for the faint-hearted though—some cutscenes are brutally vivid. But when a game is this outstanding, flaws stand out more, and here's what I noticed:  
- No SLI support—seriously? I had to shelve it until upgrading my card since it ran poorly on my old dual-GPU GTX 590. Ensure you have a solid single-GPU setup.  
- Ridiculously small obstacles are often unclimbable."

- Sound  
- Gameplay  
- Replayability  

Graphics: The game features a comic-like style. The visuals are very sleek, with no unnecessary details. The color schemes are pleasing and perfectly suit the game. You can set the graphics to 'high' without straining your system. I run this game on an i5 processor with an NVIDIA GeForce 710M card, 8GB RAM, and it runs smoothly (Windows 8.1).

But don’t buy this game thinking it’s like COD, Battlefield, or any other shooter. It’s in a class of its own and should be treated as such. Can’t tell you how many times I hear new players whine and complain about dying too quickly. Oh, heaven forbid you get shot in the face and actually die. It’s not like that doesn’t happen in real life or anything. Edit: Okay, so I’ve been playing this game for a while now. Invested a lot of money into it. One of the best multiplayer games around. A great choice when you’re not feeling CS:GO."
114,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"I'm two hours in and absolutely loving this game. So funny. Gameplay is solid, the art design is stunning, music is surprisingly high-quality and fitting, the story/world has me hooked, and the puzzles are enjoyable. But the best part beyond all that is the comedy. If you've played any RPG since the dawn of video game RPGs, you'll laugh at the jokes, parodies, and references; if you're new to RPGs, you'll still adore the humor. If you played *Final Fantasy VII* or *X*, you absolutely need to try this—without spoiling anything... I had to pause after two hours just to rest my cheeks from laughing and smiling so much. What a delight so far."
115,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"I'm really sorry, I try to be supportive of free-to-play games and indie developers, but I didn't enjoy this game. The description sounded perfect for me, but the execution fell flat. I love puzzle and exploration games, yet I found this one completely unintuitive. Even after checking how to progress, I simply didn't enjoy the gameplay. It also lacks a pause button—or if it exists, I never found it. Given that many sequences are timed, this seems like a major oversight. Additionally, the game feels more like a series of cutscenes than actual gameplay, leaving me waiting impatiently most of the time."
116,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"This game... Phew, where to even start. It was absolutely beautiful, from the story to the graphics—I was hooked. The story wasn’t just some tale but actually made me feel like I was that person, trying to figure out what came next in the journey my character was telling. The gameplay was great, and I learned a lot about myself through this game (mainly my fear of heights, which I never had a problem with until the ice caverns). My gut churned the whole time, but I pushed through for Uncle Fred! If you guys made a DLC or sequel, I’d be the first to buy it and recommend it to everyone I know. Thanks to everyone involved in making this—you created a truly beautiful game."

In previous games, you progressed through Earth's timeline, advancing from the Stone Age to the Medieval and Modern eras; however, this game is set in the future as you colonize a new planet. What I enjoy is how 2K introduced fresh mechanics like the affinity system and orbital layer. What I didn’t like was that these additions could sometimes feel overwhelming. One improvement I’d suggest is incorporating new artwork, such as the environment seen when interacting with other leaders."
118,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"Great game! Tons of replayability and a very fun zombie survival experience! Definitely in my top 5 zombie games ever played. Edit: After 60+ hours, I can honestly say this is one of the better, more realistic zombie games. It's designed like a survival horror where you must conserve ammo, treat your wounds when bleeding, take pills when infected, etc. Also, the zombies feel very natural and are well animated for a free-to-play game. P.S.: I’d recommend playing with 1 or 2 friends, but the community is super friendly, and you can easily make friends or chat with others via text or voice."
119,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"02/07/2014 - It's a shame I can't fully recommend this game because, from the short time I've played it, I know I'd be addicted if not for these two major issues. No Aussie servers—a single red bar puts you at a severe disadvantage and causes unbearable lag. Keep in mind, even the offline training mode stuttered and lagged (how does that happen?). Combine that with the poor ping, and it just ruins the experience. Everything artifacts excessively—the menus, backgrounds, training, and in-game. I've never had this issue before with this card and wondered if it disliked my overclock. I reset my GPU to stock settings, but it made no difference."
120,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"Very late last night I finished this. The story isn't particularly deep or interesting, but what makes it stand out is the storytelling. The atmosphere is brimming with detail, and the many collectibles do a great job at fleshing it out. I learned a lot about Batman's world, so it was disappointing that so few bosses were included. Oh well, future games can rectify that. The combat offers the right amount of challenge but leans toward the easier side. Leveling up Batman wasn't very satisfying. It's the gadgets you upgrade and acquire during the campaign that introduce fresh gameplay mechanics. Gaining access to previously unreachable areas creates a rewarding sense of progression."
121,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"'To the Moon' is no mere game... Nay, it is a veritable experience, and it was one of the best of my life at that. Think Telltale's *The Walking Dead* is sad? Hohoho! Well, it's no match for *To the Moon*! Never before have I been so moved yet fulfilled by something purely fictional. This masterpiece represents the pinnacle of storytelling in my opinion, and the soundtrack is a gorgeously charming and perfect accompaniment. Yes, the controls are a bit finicky and the gameplay is not the strong point, but the story is so compelling that I did not care one bit. Plus, the humor of the game is delightful as well, and it never intrudes upon the poignant nature of the story... And the *Doctor Who* references are endless."
122,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"Bastion is an absolutely brilliant game, with a captivating storyline. Set after a calamity, you begin to rebuild on the bastion. There's a wealth of choice in the game, from deciding what to build for an advantage, which weapons to wield, and what upgrades to apply, as well as selecting drinks for bonus effects. The art style and music are fantastic, with vibrant visuals that prove the apocalypse doesn’t have to be dull. Best of all, the game features dynamic narration based on your actions. For instance, if you pick up a weapon and then swap it in the armoury, the narration comments on your choice of the new weapon."
123,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"I originally purchased this game during early development, when the only currency was spacebux and there was no 'tech tree'. This was when the game was great. All guns were equally overpowered, so imbalance wasn't an issue; anyone could defeat anyone at any time. Additionally, the game provided unlimited gun slots and five loadouts. You'd think a game boasting 'bajillions of guns' would offer more than 6 weapon slots and 3 loadouts before requiring payment for extras. At one point, I owned about 3 pages of guns and was brainstorming new ideas for more—that's where I found the fun."
124,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"This game was a surprising gem. One often sees rave reviews for certain products that can be misleading. In this case, the reviews truly reflect the fun of this neat little game. It’s an odd mix between a classic 2D platformer and a MOBA, executed with style. I found myself enjoying characters I wouldn’t typically like in other MOBA games. I had expected this trait to continue but decided to try a melee tank anyway. I was pleasantly surprised by the outcome and ended up experimenting more as they unlocked through gameplay. The art style and interface are oddly charming. As a result, I now use one of the characters as my avatar and a wallpaper from crafting a card set for the game."
125,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"I just started playing, but I love this game. I put on my headphones and lose myself in the game for hours at a time. It's been a while since a game has had that effect on me. The music sets the mood, the sound effects are spot-on, and the controls are perfect. I look forward to every battle, and they've optimized combat extremely well. I had my doubts about the naval combat system, but it is so much fun to lay waste to multiple fleets at once! The only way to lose in this game is to fail to retreat. If the combat looks overwhelming, just get out of there, regroup, and counterattack. Thanks, devs, for an amazing experience!"
126,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"The reboot of the *Devil May Cry* franchise has introduced many changes for the series, particularly for its protagonist, Dante. While fans of the original games may be disappointed by the alterations to their beloved character, these shifts are ultimately for the better—and this new title by Ninja Theory proves it. *DmC* serves as the ideal entry point for newcomers to the series. It explores the origins of an arrogant, cynical Dante and chronicles his transformation from cynicism to selflessness. Throughout, the game crafts a clear narrative arc for the new Dante, making him a compelling character to follow. The story traces his journey as he confronts the corrupt world he once willfully ignored."
127,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"Where do I begin with this absolutely beautiful game? Its story is utterly charming, packed with so much detail, and it's a bundle of happiness, bad puns, annoying dogs, and secrets. It knows when to be serious but isn't afraid of funny moments. The character design is flawless, featuring diverse personalities and hidden depths. It stands out from other RPGs because you don’t have to kill anyone—a rare concept in the genre. Drawing heavy inspiration from EarthBound, one of the best RPGs I’ve seen, it’s clear this game is special. Plus, it boasts the best soundtrack I’ve heard in years."
128,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"I am recommending this solely because it's free, and might offer a more enjoyable experience for others. As for my experience, the 'game' did nothing for me. Half the story relies on shock value. I was neither shocked nor emotionally moved in any way. Maybe I'm desensitized, or perhaps it was too simplistic to provoke a reaction. The other half attempts to portray (literally) a person's mental decline. It explores obsession, hallucination, depression, and other themes. In theory, it's an intriguing concept. However, the 'game' took me just 10 minutes to complete, even while carefully reading and absorbing every detail."

It's a brilliant way to challenge your mind while remaining fun. Although this game isn't story-heavy, it spawned one of the most popular games of 2011. I still play and complete it when bored, and I love returning to see what birthed a legend and what became one. Gameplay: Portal's mechanics are simple to explain. You use portals strategically, along with buttons that activate parts of the puzzle. There are two button types: one you press and one requiring a cube."

Since most reviews focus on specs, here are mine: i5 6600k (~200€), Radeon RX 480 (~200€), Z170 Pro-Gaming (~150€), 16GB DDR4 RAM (~70€). At ~650€, this setup falls squarely in the mid-range, though admittedly, it's fairly new.

Divinity: Dragon Commander comes awfully close to being my personal favorite. Combine this with a massive Risk-like grand strategy mode, and it truly hits the mark. I try not to be overly biased, but this game lets you transform into a dragon, supporting your troops by attacking, aiding, and even directing unit production and spawning simultaneously. Honestly, I do enjoy complex RTS games nowadays, like Civ V and others. However, such games often cram intricate mechanics, charts, and resources into a single overwhelming experience."

And all this without even mentioning the world, characters, story, or gameplay... I could write pages about it. But instead, I'll just say this: if you like RPGs, play this game. If you enjoy video games, play this game. If you have seven free hours between now and your death, play this game."

There is a fairly steep learning curve to the game's mechanics, which I'm still mastering; however, this depth of strategy offers countless ways to achieve goals and capitalize on situations. The game, in my opinion, is nearly infinitely replayable. I find myself engrossed in every session I play, regardless of how the playthrough unfolds."

It's a great game to play casually. However, it may not hold your attention beyond a few months unless you truly enjoy grinding. The best part is that the game is free, so I'd recommend giving it a try. If you're looking for a quick fix, it's worth checking out."

Sadly, it's far from it. In this game, you go around absorbing increasingly larger objects to grow bigger and collect more. However, the gameplay isn't as smooth as it could be, the levels lack creativity, and the overall experience feels like a surreal horror show. I don't mean an entertaining one, but rather one that leaves you depressed and questioning the meaning of existence. Every ""living"" creature in this game, from small pets to humans, makes me wonder if the developers had a fascination with taxidermy."

A simulator of the road to becoming president! That sounds fun!* Well, it really wasn't. The game starts by making you pick a side: Republican or Democrat—there's no independent or third-party option. A little disappointed but still optimistic, I continued to see what I could do. I’ll give the game credit: the character customization, though limited, is pretty fun to experiment with. It’s the only time you get the option to wear your head or not in a campaign. Literally."

Power armor requires no effort—it's handed to you early in the game, and fusion cores are abundant in shops. The value of power armor is greatly diminished compared to previous Fallout titles. The story is mediocre, and most aspects of this game are average, though it doesn't crash every 10 minutes like Fallout 3. It's far more stable than Fallout 3. Is it better than Fallout 3? No. Is it better than New Vegas? No. This title was massively overhyped for how disappointing it truly is."

- Enemies always pinpoint your location once spotted  
- Frustrating godlike enemy accuracy, reminiscent of the first Ghost Warrior  
- Poor checkpoint and save system  
- Unengaging story that fails to hold interest

For one thing, I own a Vive and prefer playing room-scale games with motion controllers. Beyond that, the game is initially awe-inspiring in the scope of its universe, but I also felt that same scale hindered my enjoyment. The steep learning curve and the time required to do anything interesting early on were both too much for me. Perhaps if I were more patient and had more free time, this would appeal to me.

Single hits to the chest, neck, or head from rifle-caliber weapons almost always prove fatal unless they merely graze you. Rounds drop over distance, and short, controlled bursts are essential to stay on target. There is no magical ammunition pool. If you constantly reload mid-magazine, you’ll end up with a pouch full of half-empty mags. You can't sprint indefinitely. If you run too long, your aim will falter as you gasp for air until you recover. Rest your weapon on your elbows while prone or on a window ledge to steady your aim. Accuracy suffers when standing."

Initially, it defaulted to high and ran sluggishly, though not unplayably so, but switching to medium smoothed things out.

Yukos' US lawyers will attempt to freeze Baikal's assets after the Russian government disregarded a US court order last week halting the sale. Baikal's background and motives for the acquisition remain unclear. Russian newspapers allege that Baikal—which acquired the Yuganskneftegas production unit for $9.4bn (261bn roubles, £4.8bn) at a state-backed auction on Sunday—has close ties to Surgutneftegas, Russia's fourth-largest oil producer."

Within this family, we identify a tracking solution with a single parameter to simultaneously control the transfer fidelity, excited-state population, and robustness.

We demonstrate that all local minima share a common structural form, partially identifying the true component centers. Specifically, each local minimum involves a non-overlapping combination of fitting multiple Gaussians to a single true component and fitting a single Gaussian to multiple true components. Our results apply when the true mixture components satisfy a certain separation condition and remain valid even if the number of components is over- or under-specified. For Gaussian mixtures with three components, we derive sharper results based on the scaling with the separation between the components."

For $n$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-like states, the most robust witness scheme requires $n+1$ local measurement settings and can tolerate up to $1/2$ white noise.

These geometries can violate the axial and equatorial symmetry of the Kerr metric and exhibit a far richer multipolar structure, offering a pathway to phenomenologically constrain fuzzball models. We find numerical evidence that all multipole moments are typically larger (in absolute value) than those of a Kerr black hole with identical mass and spin.

To address these limitations, we propose a model based on temporal point processes and variational autoencoders that learns to infer temporal attention between nodes by analyzing node communication. Since temporal attention governs between-node feature propagation, using interaction dynamics to learn this critical component offers greater flexibility while avoiding problems associated with human-specified edges."

The nonparametric formulation of this approach, known as modal clustering, establishes a correspondence between the groups and the domains of attraction of the density modes. Operationally, a nonparametric density estimate is required, and selecting an appropriate amount of smoothing—which governs the density's shape and thus the modal structure—is crucial to identifying the final partition.

The emergence of the term ""data science"" presents a historic opportunity to redefine data analysis in a way that naturally incorporates causal inference from observational data. Like others before, we categorize the scientific contributions of data science into three classes of tasks: description, prediction, and counterfactual prediction (which includes causal inference). A clear classification of data science tasks is essential to discuss the data, assumptions, and methods needed to successfully achieve each task. We argue that neglecting to properly describe the role of subject-matter expertise in data analysis leads to widespread misunderstandings about data science."
217,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,paper_abstract,"The weak gravity conjecture (WGC) requires the existence of superextremal particles in any consistent quantum theory of gravity. The standard lore is that these particles ensure extremal black holes are either unstable or marginally stable, but it remains unclear what goes wrong if this condition fails. This note demonstrates that, for a generic Einstein quantum theory of gravity in AdS, exact stability of extremal black branes conflicts with rigorously proven quantum information theorems about entanglement entropy. Avoiding this contradiction leads to a nonperturbative version of the WGC, which reduces to the conventional statement at weak coupling. The argument is general and does not rely on supersymmetry or a specific UV completion, assuming only the validity of Einsteinian gravity, effective field theory, and holography."
218,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,paper_abstract,"Understanding how strongly correlated two-dimensional (2D) systems can give rise to unconventional superconductivity with high critical temperatures remains one of the major unsolved problems in condensed matter physics. Ultracold 2D Fermi gases have emerged as clean and controllable model systems to investigate the interplay of strong correlations and reduced dimensionality, yet direct evidence of superfluidity in these systems has been lacking. Here, we demonstrate superfluidity in an ultracold 2D Fermi gas by moving a periodic potential through the system and observing no dissipation below a critical velocity v$_{\rm c}$. We measure v$_{\rm c}$ as a function of interaction strength and find a peak in the crossover regime between bosonic and fermionic superfluidity. Our results establish ultracold Fermi gases as a powerful platform for studying the influence of reduced dimensionality on strongly correlated superfluids."
219,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,paper_abstract,"Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are mathematical models widely used in fields such as climatology, bioinformatics, and chemical engineering due to their intuitive modeling appeal. Despite their broad application, the frequent lack of analytic solutions complicates parameter estimation, particularly for models with numerous variables and parameters. This paper proposes a fast and accurate Bayesian ODE parameter estimation algorithm, even for high-dimensional models. The method approximates an ODE model using a state-space representation derived from numerical solver equations. It enables rapid estimation by bypassing full numerical solution computations in the likelihood. The posterior is obtained via variational Bayes, specifically the approximate Riemannian conjugate gradient method (Honkela et al.)."

Our results show that the differential conductance and induced pairing amplitudes strongly depend on the angle between the junction direction in real space and the axis separating the Weyl nodes in momentum space. We analyze the influence of a chiral chemical potential, i.e., the electron population imbalance between Weyl nodes of opposite chirality, on the transport characteristics of the junction. Notably, we observe a net spin polarization of Cooper pairs generated via Andreev reflection in the two WSM regions. The spin polarization is opposite in the two WSM regions and highly sensitive to the chirality imbalance and excitation energy."
221,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,paper_abstract,"Metal ion implantation into ceramics has proven to be an effective and controllable technique for modifying the surface electrical conductivity of ceramic materials, and this approach has been widely adopted in various applications. Notably, it enables precise grading of the voltage drop across high-voltage insulators, thereby enhancing the maximum operational voltage without surface flashover. However, a key concern regarding this method is the long-term stability of the implantation-induced conductivity, particularly if the implanted metal species is prone to oxidation. Here we present our investigation into the long-term behavior of surface conductivity in titanium-implanted alumina. The results reveal that after an initial decline of up to 40% within the first few weeks post-implantation, the conductivity exhibits only a gradual decrease of approximately 10% over the subsequent year."

The associated charge matches the skyrmion charge for any smooth configuration. Moreover, singular configurations exist that correspond to \(n_f=1\) baryons charged under the new symmetry. In this framework, the vector mesons act as Chern-Simons vector fields residing on the quantum Hall droplet that forms the \(n_f=1\) baryon. We argue that this current represents the correct low-energy effective expression for the baryon current. Our proposal unifies the two types of baryons, enabling a natural continuous transformation between them. Furthermore, Chern-Simons dualities on the droplet can be understood as arising from a Seiberg-like duality between gluons and vector mesons."

We theoretically examine how the superposition of both effects influences superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator/superconductor junctions' transport properties. Transverse momentum-dependent skew tunneling of Cooper pairs through the spin-active ferromagnetic insulator interface generates sizable transverse Hall supercurrents, which we term anomalous Josephson Hall effect currents. We extend the Furusaki-Tsukada formula, originally developed to quantify conventional (tunneling) Josephson currents, to assess the transverse current components and show that their amplitudes are highly tunable via spin-orbit coupling strengths or the superconducting phase difference across the junction. As a distinct spectroscopic signature of Josephson junctions, well-localized subgap bound states emerge near the interface."

Turbul. 2020), that dipoles are as crucial to the dynamics of decaying two-dimensional turbulence as individual vortex cores, we find that the kinetic energy of this flow is carried by elongated streams formed by the merging of dipoles. Vortices separate into a group of small fast-moving cores and another group of larger, slowly moving ones, which can be described as 'frozen' into a gradually evolving 'crystal'. The kinematics of both groups differ significantly, and only the former is self-similar. The latter contains most of the flow's kinetic energy, and its vortices create the dipoles and streams. Mechanisms are examined for the growth of this slow component."

In this article, we present improved upper bounds for the quantum hitting time applicable to numerous ctqw-based quantum algorithms. Specifically, we apply our techniques to the glued-trees problem, enhancing their hitting time upper bound by a polynomial factor: from \(o(n^5)\) to \(o(n^2\log n)\). Additionally, our methods exponentially improve the precision dependence of the continuous-time quantum walk algorithm by Chakraborty et al. for finding a marked node on any ergodic, reversible Markov chain."

In this letter, we highlight an alternative EMRI formation channel: (wet) EMRI formation assisted by the accretion flow around accreting galactic-center massive black holes (MBHs). In this channel, the accretion disk captures stellar-mass black holes initially moving on inclined orbits, then drives them to migrate toward the MBH—boosting the EMRI formation rate in such galaxies by orders of magnitude."

It has also been successfully applied in wireless communications, despite the fact that current radio systems are well-understood and optimal algorithms exist for many tasks. While some improvements have been achieved by learning individual parts of a receiver, a superior approach is to jointly learn the entire receiver. This, however, often leads to a complex nonlinear problem, for which the optimal solution is impractical to implement. To address this, we propose a deep fully convolutional neural network, DeepRx, which executes the entire receiver pipeline from frequency domain signal stream to uncoded bits in a 5G-compliant manner. We enable accurate channel estimation by carefully constructing the input of the convolutional neural network using both data and pilot symbols."
229,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,paper_abstract,"Mutation-based fuzzing typically uses an initial set of non-crashing seed inputs (a corpus) to generate new inputs through mutation. A corpus of potential seeds often contains thousands of similar inputs. This lack of diversity can result in wasted fuzzing effort due to exhaustive mutation from all available seeds. To address this, fuzzers include distillation tools (e.g., afl-cmin) that select the smallest subset of seeds triggering the same range of instrumentation data points as the full corpus. Common practice indicates that minimizing the number and cumulative size of seeds improves fuzzing efficiency, which we examine systematically. We present results from 34+ cpu-years of fuzzing with five distillation approaches to assess their impact on finding bugs in real-world software."

The agents can be divided into several groups, each containing agents with similar (isomorphic) state transition structures, allowing them to be relabeled into the same template. Based on this template, a scalable supervisor—whose state size and computational cost remain constant regardless of the number of agents—is designed for partial observation. The scalable supervisor under partial observation does not require recomputation even when agents are added or removed from the system. We extend our earlier results to partial observation by proposing sufficient conditions for safety and maximal permissiveness of the scalable least restrictive supervisor at the template level. An example illustrates the proposed scalable supervisory synthesis."

Furthermore, this approach incorporates, for the first time in ENF analysis, a non-rectangular temporal window prior to spectral estimation. Krylov matrices enable fast matrix inversion. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in ENF estimation, particularly with a short 1-second window in power recordings. For speech recordings, it delivers highly accurate results in both time complexity and precision."

Here, we investigated the fluorescence anomalous saturating effect of the nitrogen vacancy defect in diamond. Fluorescence reduction was observed under high-power laser excitation, which enhanced the nonlinearity of the emission and altered the spatial frequency distribution of the fluorescence image. We employed a differential excitation protocol to extract high spatial frequency information. By modulating the excitation laser's power, the imaging resolution improved approximately 1.6 times compared to confocal microscopy. Due to the simplicity of the experimental setup and data processing, we expect this method can enhance spatial resolution for sensing and biological labeling with defects in solids."

We compare our approach with frequentist methods relying on numerical integration, showing that only the Bayesian method achieves both design-unbiased estimation and consistency with the population distribution.

These primary processes alternate within a temperature range of approximately fifty degrees. Dielectric spectroscopy also revealed two distinct orientational relaxation processes: the first arises from rotation of the side mesogenic groups, while the second is linked to movement of the main chain segments."

Optimizing discrete hash bits remains a key focus in deep hashing methods. A common strategy in these approaches is to employ an activation function, such as $\operatorname{sigmoid}(\cdot)$ or $\operatorname{tanh}(\cdot)$, and minimize a quantization loss to approximate discrete values. However, this paradigm may cause an increasing number of hash bits to become trapped in the wrong saturated regions of the activation functions without recovery. We refer to this issue as the ""dead bits problem (dbp)"". Additionally, existing quantization losses can exacerbate dbp. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective gradient amplifier applied before activation functions to mitigate dbp."

The standard scenario assumes an initially circular and narrow belt of planetesimals at semi-major axis \(a\), whose eccentricity rises to \(e_f\) after the gas disc disperses due to secular perturbations from an eccentric planet, producing a belt of width \(2ae_f\). A slight modification suggests narrower belts may form if the planetesimals are initially eccentric, possibly due to earlier planet perturbations during the gas-rich protoplanetary disc phase. Alternatively, primordial eccentricity could arise from instabilities that amplify the disc eccentricity, independent of planets."

This few-get-richer effect arises in settings where there are limited distinct classes of items (e.g., left-leaning news sources versus right-leaning news sources), and items are ranked by popularity. We analytically demonstrate that the few-get-richer effect occurs when users tend to click on top-ranked items and have diverse preferences for item classes.

With carefully designed patterns, our proposed pruning method consistently achieves unprecedented accuracy improvement and enhanced feature extraction capability across various DNN architectures and datasets. Moreover, our pattern-aware pruning framework simultaneously accomplishes pattern library extraction, pattern selection, pattern and connectivity pruning, and weight training.

They were victims of supernatural paranoia, misguided religious fervor—and a justice system that prioritized repentance over truth. Salem was founded in 1626 by Puritans, a group of English Protestants. Life was harsh and isolated for its residents. Conflicts with Native American neighbors and French settlers were frequent."
262,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,speech,"There are currently hundreds of thousands of people on transplant lists, waiting for vital organs like kidneys, hearts, and livers that could save their lives. Unfortunately, there aren’t nearly enough donor organs available to meet that demand. What if instead of waiting, we could create brand-new, customized organs from scratch? That’s the idea behind bioprinting, a branch of regenerative medicine currently in development. While we can’t yet print complex organs, simpler tissues such as blood vessels and tubes responsible for nutrient and waste exchange are already within our reach. Bioprinting is a biological cousin of 3D printing, a technique that deposits layers of material on top of each other to construct a three-dimensional object one slice at a time."
263,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,speech,"Good afternoon, I'm proud to be here at TEDxKrakow. Today, I'll speak about a phenomenon that can—and indeed is—changing the world: the power of people. I'll begin with an anecdote or, for Monty Python fans, a sketch-like story. Here it is: It's December 15, 2010. Someone offers you a bet: you'll gaze into a crystal ball and see the future—an accurate one. But you must share it with the world. Curiosity gets the better of you, so you take the bet and look. One hour later, you're in a national TV studio, on a top show, telling your story."
264,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,speech,"We're going to begin in 1964. Bob Dylan is 23 years old, and his career is just reaching its peak. He's been hailed as the voice of a generation, and he's producing classic songs at an astonishing rate, but there's a small group of dissenters who claim that Bob Dylan is stealing other people's music.  

2004. Brian Burton, aka Danger Mouse, takes The Beatles' *White Album*, blends it with Jay-Z's *The Black Album* to create *The Grey Album*. The album becomes an instant sensation online, and The Beatles' record company sends out numerous cease-and-desist letters for ""unfair competition and dilution of our valuable property."" Now, *The Grey Album* is considered a remix."
265,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,speech,"Well, that's a fairly obvious statement up there. I began with that sentence about 12 years ago, focusing initially on developing countries, but you're here from every corner of the world. So if you picture a map of your country, you'll realize that for every nation on earth, you could draw small circles to indicate, 'these are places where good teachers won't go.' Moreover, those are the areas from which trouble arises. So we face an ironic problem — good teachers avoid precisely the places where they're needed most. I started in 1999 to tackle this issue with an experiment, a very simple one in New Delhi."
266,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,speech,"Currently, most refugees live in cities rather than in refugee camps. We account for over 60 percent of refugees globally. With the majority residing in urban areas, there is a pressing need for a paradigm shift and innovative thinking. Instead of wasting money on building walls, it would be wiser to invest in programs that empower refugees to support themselves. (applause) We always have to leave behind our possessions, but not our skills and knowledge. If given the opportunity to live productively, refugees can thrive and contribute to their host country's development. I was born in Bukavu, South Kivu, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. I am the fifth-born in a family of 12 children."
267,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,speech,"I have two questions for you. One: whose shoulders do you stand on? And two: what do you stand for? These are two questions that I always begin my poetry workshops with because, at times, poetry can seem like a dead art form for old white men who appear as if they were born to be old—like Benjamin Button or something. I ask my students these two questions, and then I share how I answer them, which is in these three sentences: I am the daughter of Black writers, who are descended from freedom fighters who broke their chains and changed the world. They call me. And these are words I repeat as a mantra before every poetry performance. In fact, I was doing it in the corner over there, making faces."

For about five years after graduating from a respected liberal arts university, this was my day job. (Laughter) I was a self-employed living statue called the Eight-Foot Bride, and I love telling people about this job because everyone always wonders, who are these people in real life? (Laughter) Hello. I painted myself white one day, stood on a box, placed a hat or a can at my feet, and when someone dropped in money, I handed them a flower—along with some intense eye contact. And if they didn’t take the flower, I added a gesture of sadness and longing as they walked away."
269,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,speech,"On October 4, 1957, the world watched in awe and fear as the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the first artificial satellite, into space. This small metal sphere, less than two feet in diameter, ignited a space race between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. that would last for eighteen years and transform the world as we know it. Sputnik was not the earliest human technology to reach space. That distinction belongs to the V-2 rocket, employed by Germany in missile attacks against Allied cities during the final years of World War II. Though largely ineffective, by the war's end both the U.S. and U.S.S.R. had seized the technology and the scientists behind it, using them for their own ambitious projects."

I'm a voracious reader, one who enjoys everything from Ian McEwan to Stephanie Meyer. I have read the Twilight tetralogy. And I live for my home theater, where I devour DVDs, video on demand, and plenty of television.

A simple word describing a natural biological process, weighed down by centuries of stigma, has been transformed into something most of us can only mention in whispers. But why? As I speak to you right now, more than 800 million women worldwide are menstruating. None of us would exist without it, and yet it remains an ""embarrassing"" subject to discuss. From my experience and that of the women around me, I can tell you that it's exhausting. It's exhausting to carefully pull out a brown paper bag concealing a pad, stuffing it into your pocket in the middle of a class and rushing to the washroom as discreetly as possible. It's exhausting to sit through lessons and meetings pretending to be perfectly normal, while internally crying out from intense period cramps."
273,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,speech,"The world's largest and most devastating environmental and industrial project is located in the heart of the largest and most intact forest on Earth: Canada's boreal forest. It spans northern Canada, including Labrador, where the world's last great wild caribou herd resides—the George River herd, with roughly 400,000 animals. Sadly, during my visit, I couldn't spot a single one, though the antlers serve as evidence. Across the boreal region, we're fortunate to have an extraordinary wealth of wetlands. Globally, these are among the most threatened ecosystems. They are vital, purifying air and water, storing vast amounts of greenhouse gases, and supporting immense biodiversity."
274,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,speech,"Before the world of humans began, there was the realm of the gods, filled with fields, plains, and gardens. Four brothers wandered this celestial land. They had no family besides each other—they didn’t even know their parents. One brother, Deminan, looked different from the others. His skin was covered in painful sores, and he wondered why he alone bore this affliction. One day, while the supreme spirit Yaya was in his gardens, Deminan and his brothers sneaked into Yaya’s house. After feasting and exploring, they noticed a giant gourd hanging in the corner. But as they peered inside, they dropped it."
275,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,speech,"So, I graduated seven years ago from Berkeley with a dual degree in molecular and cell biology and linguistics, and I attended a career fair here on campus, where I secured an interview with a start-up called Theranos. At the time, there wasn’t much information about the company, but the little available was truly impressive. Essentially, the company was developing a medical device that could run an entire blood panel using just a finger-stick of blood. This meant you wouldn’t need a large needle in your arm to complete a blood test. The concept was fascinating not only because it reduced discomfort but also because it had the potential to enable predictive diagnostics."
276,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,speech,"My journey to become a polar specialist, photographing and specializing in the polar regions, began when I was four years old, when my family moved from southern Canada to northern Baffin Island, near Greenland. There we lived with the Inuit in a small community of 200 people, where we were one of three non-Inuit families. In this community, we didn't have a television, computers, or even a radio. We didn't even have a telephone. Most of my time was spent outside with the Inuit, playing. The snow and ice were my sandbox, and the Inuit were my teachers. That's where I became truly captivated by this polar realm."
277,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,speech,"We're seen as the organization that catches the fallout of failed social policy. I can't define who comes to us or how long they stay. We get the people for whom nothing else has worked, those who have slipped through every other social safety net. They can't handle them, so we must. That's our role: contain them, manage them. Over the years, as a prison system, as a nation, and as a society, we've become very skilled at that, but that shouldn't bring you pride. Today we incarcerate more people per capita than any other country in the world. We have more black men in prison today than were enslaved in 1850."
278,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,speech,"I'd like to take you on the epic quest of the Rosetta spacecraft. To escort and land the probe on a comet has been my passion for the past two years. To achieve this, I need to explain something about the origin of the solar system. When we go back four and a half billion years, there was a cloud of gas and dust. At the center of this cloud, our sun formed and ignited. Alongside it, what we now know as planets, comets, and asteroids took shape. According to theory, after Earth cooled slightly following its formation, comets collided with it extensively, delivering water. They likely also brought complex organic material to Earth, which may have sparked the emergence of life."

You know, when we launched this ""Build Back Better"" series, our goal was to tackle challenges emerging from the pandemic and envision recovery. But the events of this past week—the tragic death of George Floyd and the ongoing protests—have introduced a new urgency we must confront. Can we truly build back better from this? Before we even attempt to answer that, we need to grasp the gravity of this moment.  

Whitney Pennington Rodgers: That's right, Chris."
280,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,speech,"In 1903, the president of the United States embarked on a three-day camping trip in California’s Yosemite Valley. President Theodore Roosevelt slept among towering sequoia trees, weathered a snowstorm, and spent hours conversing around the campfire with his host and guide, conservationist John Muir. Roosevelt famously loved the outdoors, but Muir had invited him there for more than just camping: Yosemite was in peril. Though Yosemite became protected land in 1864, the valley still faced threats of overdevelopment in 1903. It was at the heart of a decades-long struggle to preserve land for both conservation and public use—two goals far easier said than achieved. The battle over Yosemite began with the 1849 Gold Rush, when miners flocked west, searching for gold in the Sierra Nevada foothills."

(applause) My dream has always been to become a pilot, to fly a plane, to feel the freedom of soaring through the sky, to touch the clouds. But that didn’t happen. Simply put, I live in Gaza, where there is no airport. All borders are closed on every side. We live in one of the largest prisons in the world. The only thing I can do is gaze up at the sky. Some days, we're lucky if we have electricity for four or five hours. When it's cold, we build a fire in front or on the roof of our homes."
282,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,speech,"I am sorry I cannot show you my face, because if I do, the bad guys will come for me. My journey started 14 years ago. I was a young reporter fresh out of college. Then I got a scoop—a seemingly simple story about police officers taking bribes from street hawkers. As a new reporter, I wanted to approach it differently to maximize impact, since everyone knew it was happening, yet nothing was being done. So I decided to go undercover as a seller. While working, I gathered solid evidence. The impact was tremendous—truly fantastic. This is what many call immersion journalism or undercover journalism."
283,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,speech,"One simple vitamin can lower your risk of heart disease. Eating chocolate decreases stress in students. A new drug extends lives of patients with rare disease. Health headlines like these appear daily, often making conflicting claims. There can be a gap between bold, attention-grabbing headlines and the nuanced, gradual findings of the studies they reference. So how can you avoid being misled by flashy headlines? The best approach to evaluate a headline’s reliability is to examine the original research it cites. We’ve created a hypothetical study for each of these three examples. Keep watching for the breakdown of the first scenario; then pause at the headline to answer the question. These are simplified cases."

One day my mom asked, ""What day should we put for their birthday?"" ""Uh, the day they were born, obviously?"" Seemed like a ridiculous question. Then my mom said, ""Well, Kristen, neither of your little brothers has a birth certificate, so how do you suggest we find out when that was?"" Mind blown. Now, 20 years later, I'm still working on it—except instead of trying to solve the mystery of my brothers' missing birth certificates, I work to address this issue globally. So what do birth certificates have to do with international development?"

If given the choice to embrace that kind of existence, would you? That’s the question philosopher Robert Nozick posed through a thought experiment he called the Experience Machine. The experiment asks us to envision a world where scientists have created a device capable of simulating reality while ensuring only pleasurable experiences, free from pain. The catch? You must abandon reality permanently, though you’d scarcely notice the difference. Your experiences would be indistinguishable from real life. Life’s natural highs and lows would simply be replaced with endless joy. Sounds perfect, doesn’t it?"

I was consulted to see a woman in her 70s—a retired English professor with pancreatic cancer. She was referred to me due to her pain, nausea, and vomiting. During our discussion about these symptoms, she asked if I thought medical marijuana might help her. I reflected on everything I had learned in medical school about medical marijuana, which didn’t take long because I had learned nothing at all."

As firefighters, my team and I are tasked with saving lives and property from disasters such as car wrecks, house fires, and life-threatening medical emergencies. I am a woman leading a department in a male-dominated profession. A decade ago, I decided to expand my medical knowledge and earned a nursing degree. That was because it became clear that the next major threat facing not only my city, but other cities nationwide, was not the one-time disaster, where you can rush in like the cavalry, extinguish the fire, and leave, feeling like you’ve made a difference and everything is fine."
288,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,speech,"Where does all the carbon we release go? Carbon operates in a natural cycle, present in all living things: in the soil, in the oceans, in the atmosphere, and in rocks deep underground. When plants and other organisms die, much of their stored carbon returns to the atmosphere until new plants grow and reabsorb it. But over millions of years, some of the carbon stored in ancient trees and marine life transforms into rock, while some becomes fossil fuels: coal, oil, and natural gas. Natural events like volcanic eruptions release some of the carbon trapped in rock. Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, also release prehistoric carbon. Today, humans emit around 60 times more carbon than all the volcanoes on Earth each year."
289,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,speech,"Even nature's most disgusting creatures hold important secrets, but who would welcome a swarm of cockroaches approaching them? Yet one of the greatest distinctions between natural and human technologies lies in robustness. Robust systems remain stable in complex and unfamiliar environments. Remarkably, cockroaches can self-stabilize while running over rough terrain. When we equipped them with a jet pack or subjected them to disturbances like an earthquake, we found that their finely tuned legs enable them to self-stabilize without relying on their brains. They navigate complex terrain, such as grass, effortlessly without losing balance. We observed a novel behavior where, due to their body shape, they automatically roll onto their side to traverse this artificial patch of grass. Robust systems can accomplish multiple tasks with the same structure—here's a new behavior we've uncovered."

And so, I would like to cheer you up with one of the great, albeit largely overlooked, commercial success stories of the past two decades. Comparable, in its own peculiar way, to the achievements of Microsoft or Google. And it's an industry that has weathered the current recession with remarkable resilience. I refer to organized crime. Now, organized crime has existed for centuries, I hear you say, and these would be wise words indeed. But in recent years, it has undergone unprecedented expansion, now accounting for nearly 15 percent of global GDP. I like to call it the global shadow economy, or McMafia, for short. So what sparked this extraordinary rise in cross-border crime?"

Many parents face difficult questions and challenging decisions. Should we tell our child about the sperm donation? If so, when? What words should we use? Sperm donors are often called 'biological fathers,' but is 'father' the right term? As a philosopher and social scientist, I have studied these questions about the concept of parenthood. But today, I will share what I learned from speaking to parents and children. I will show you that they understand what truly matters in a family, even if their family looks a little different."

(Cheers) I see all of that and a man who spent a quarter of his life in state prison—six years, to be exact, starting as a teenager on Rikers Island for an act that nearly cost a man his life. But what got me from there to here wasn’t the punishment I endured as a teenager in adult prison or the harshness of our legal system. Instead, it was the learning environment of a classroom that introduced me to something I didn’t believe was possible for me or our justice system as a whole. A few weeks before my release on parole, a counselor encouraged me to enroll in a new college course offered in the prison."

And, like too many 20-somethings, I expected to solve the world's problems — more specifically, the world's water problems — with my technology. I had a lot to learn. It was seductive, believing that our biggest water quality issues persist because they're so hard to identify. And I assumed we just needed simpler, faster, and more affordable sensors. I was wrong."

We can transmit highly complex thoughts to one another. So what I'm doing right now is, I'm making sounds with my mouth as I exhale. I'm producing tones, hisses, and puffs, and those are creating vibrations in the air. Those vibrations travel to you, they strike your eardrums, and then your brain converts those vibrations into thoughts. I hope. (laughter) I hope that's happening.

Another thing to consider is what an honor it is, as a politician, to deliver a TED Talk, especially here in the U.K., where the reputation of politics, after the expenses scandal, has plummeted so low. There was even a story recently that scientists considered replacing rats in their experiments with politicians. When asked why, they replied, ""Well, there’s no shortage of politicians, few care what happens to them, and, after all, there are some things rats simply won’t do.""
