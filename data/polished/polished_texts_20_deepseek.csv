Hairstylist Jonathan Antin wants to build a second location for his incredibly popular West Hollywood salon, this time in Beverly Hills. Normally no one would care, certainly not me, but as I was flipping through the channels, I caught a glimpse of Jonathan—equally narcissistic and dull—looking at an empty space on Rodeo Dr., declaring (in a public voice), 'I am going to build here the greatest salon in the history of the world!' And I was hooked. Not since Rocco have I found such a moron compelling to watch.""

Re: Loss of Continuity in PX Day-Ahead Auction Due to ISO Rule Changes  

The emergency tariff filing by the California ISO last Friday has negatively impacted the PX day-ahead auction market. The combination of soft and hard caps creates a complete disconnect and poses unacceptable risks for all participants, likely failing to deliver the ISO's intended reduction in real-time energy sales and procurement. The overall effect will be that supply will still defer to the higher realized price opportunity the ISO offers. The PX is petitioning Terry Winter of the ISO to promptly permit adjustment bids on any submitted schedule at any relevant price.""

The upgrade system is well-balanced and becomes intuitive without feeling tedious. Elemental effects and limited ammo gently encourage you to experiment with different weapons. There are plenty of cool, unique weapons (a key distinction from *Borderlands*' reliance on RNG loot) that remain viable throughout the game.

Edward was quite an interesting character, and so were all the side characters. I felt like all the collectibles actually mattered in this AC game, unlike previous ones—maybe because they had a greater purpose.

I'd take this game over any Call of Duty title any day, but its pay-to-win microtransaction format is off-putting for me. If you're fine with this model, then by all means, have fun.

Graphically, the cel-shaded presentation is flawless, and very, very Generation One. But beyond that, it's actually a highly enjoyable game. The combat mechanics are exceptionally well done. Transforming mid-fight is often essential, and woven seamlessly into combos, making it quite unlike High Moon's outstanding *War for/Fall of Cybertron* games. Another key difference is the strong emphasis on melee combat, though some enemies (e.g., Seekers) demand switching to a ranged blaster.""

Divinity: Dragon Commander comes awfully close to being my personal favorite. Combine this with a massive Risk-like grand strategy mode, and it truly hits the mark. I try not to be overly biased, but this game lets you transform into a dragon, aiding your troops by supporting, attacking, and even directing unit production and spawning simultaneously. Honestly, I do enjoy complex RTS games nowadays, like Civ V. However, such games often cram intricate mechanics, charts, and resources into one overwhelming experience.""

It's a great game to play casually. However, I doubt it will hold your attention beyond a few months unless you truly enjoy grinding.

To address this, fuzzers include distillation tools (e.g., afl-cmin) that select the smallest subset of seeds triggering the same range of instrumentation data points as the full corpus. Common practice suggests that minimizing the number and cumulative size of seeds improves fuzzing efficiency, which we examine systematically. We present results from 34+ cpu-years of fuzzing with five distillation approaches to evaluate their impact on finding bugs in real-world software."
230,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,paper_abstract,"""In this paper, we investigate multi-agent discrete-event systems with partial observation. The agents can be divided into groups where each has isomorphic state transition structures, allowing them to be relabeled into the same template. Based on this template, a scalable supervisor—whose state size and computational cost remain independent of the number of agents—is designed for partial observation. The scalable supervisor under partial observation does not require recomputation, regardless of how many agents are added or removed. We extend our earlier results to partial observation by proposing sufficient conditions for safety and maximal permissiveness of the scalable least restrictive supervisor at the template level. An example illustrates the proposed scalable supervisory synthesis."

An efficient approach for ENF estimation is introduced, utilizing temporal windowing based on the filter-bank Capon spectral estimator. A Gohberg-Semencul factorization of the model covariance matrix is employed, leveraging the Toeplitz structure of the matrix. Furthermore, this method introduces, for the first time in ENF analysis, a non-rectangular temporal window prior to spectral estimation. Krylov matrices enable fast matrix inversion. The proposed approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods in ENF estimation when using a short 1-second time window in power recordings. For speech recordings, it delivers highly accurate results in both time complexity and precision.""

The dimension reduction methods included fall into three categories: projection pursuit-based dimension reduction, sufficient dimension reduction, and robust M-estimators for dimension reduction. As a corollary, regularized regression estimators based on these reduced-dimension spaces are also provided, ranging from classical principal component regression to sparse partial robust M regression. The package also includes a set of classical and robust preprocessing utilities, such as generalized spatial signs, along with dedicated plotting functionality and cross-validation tools. Finally, direpack has been designed to align with the scikit-learn API, ensuring that the estimators can seamlessly integrate into (statistical and/or machine) learning pipelines within that framework."

We employed a differential excitation protocol to extract high spatial frequency information. By modulating the excitation laser's power, the imaging resolution improved approximately 1.6 times compared to confocal microscopy. Due to the simplicity of the experimental setup and data processing, we expect this method can enhance spatial resolution for sensing and biological labeling with solid-state defects.""

Our simulations and real-data example from a business establishment survey demonstrate the method's utility across various models and sampling designs. This work culminates recent developments combining traditional survey estimation with Bayesian modeling, bridging two rich but distinct sub-fields.""

These primary processes alternate within a temperature range of approximately fifty degrees.

However, this approach may cause increasing numbers of hash bits to become trapped in the wrong saturated regions of the activation functions without recovery. We refer to this issue as the ""dead bits problem (dbp)"". Additionally, existing quantization loss can worsen dbp.

A slight modification suggests narrower belts may form if the planetesimals are initially eccentric, possibly due to earlier planet perturbations during the gas-rich protoplanetary disc phase. Alternatively, a primordial eccentricity could arise from instabilities that amplify the disc eccentricity, independent of planets.""

This few-get-richer effect arises in settings where there are limited distinct classes of items (e.g., left-leaning news sources versus right-leaning news sources), and items are ranked by popularity. We demonstrate analytically that the few-get-richer effect occurs when users tend to click on top-ranked items and have diverse preferences for the classes of items.

However, most pruning techniques are essentially trade-offs between model accuracy and regularity, leading to impaired inference accuracy and limited on-device acceleration performance. To address this problem, we introduce a new sparsity dimension—pattern-based sparsity—which comprises pattern and connectivity sparsity, achieving both high accuracy and hardware efficiency. With carefully designed patterns, our proposed pruning method consistently enhances accuracy and improves feature extraction across various DNN architectures and datasets. Additionally, our pattern-aware pruning framework simultaneously performs pattern library extraction, pattern selection, and connectivity pruning alongside weight training. Our approach to pattern-based sparsity naturally integrates with compiler optimizations for highly efficient DNN execution on mobile platforms."

According to theory, once Earth had cooled slightly after its formation, comets bombarded the planet, delivering water. They likely also brought complex organic material, which may have jumpstarted the emergence of life."

You know, when we launched this ""Build Back Better"" series, our goal was to address challenges emerging from the pandemic and explore how to recover. But the events of this past week—the tragic death of George Floyd and the ongoing protests—have introduced a new urgency we must confront. Can we truly build back better from this? Before we even attempt to answer that, we need to grasp the magnitude of this moment.  
Whitney Pennington Rodgers: That's right, Chris.

President Theodore Roosevelt slept in a grove of towering sequoias, camped in a snowstorm, and spent hours talking by the campfire with his host and guide, conservationist John Muir. Roosevelt famously loved the outdoors, but Muir had invited him there for more than just camping  Yosemite was in danger. Though Yosemite became protected land in 1864, the valley still faced the threat of overdevelopment in 1903. It was at the heart of a decades-long struggle to preserve land for both conservation and public use—two goals far easier said than achieved. The battle over Yosemite began with the 1849 Gold Rush, when miners flooded west, seeking gold in the Sierra Nevada foothills."

(applause) My dream has always been to become a pilot, to fly a plane, to feel the freedom of soaring through the sky, to touch the clouds. But that never happened. Simply put, I live in Gaza, where there is no airport. All borders are closed on every side. We live in one of the biggest prisons in the world. The only thing I can do is gaze up at the sky. Some days, we're lucky if we have electricity for four or five hours. When it's cold, we light a fire in front or on the roof of our homes."

One day, my mom asked, 'What day should we put for their birthday?' 'Uh, the day they were born, obviously?' Ridiculous question. Then my mom said, 'Well, Kristen, neither of your little brothers has a birth certificate, so how do you suggest we find out when that was?' Mind blown. Now, 20 years later, I'm still working on it—except instead of solving the mystery of my brothers' missing birth certificates, I try to address this issue globally. So, what do birth certificates have to do with international development?""

285,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,speech,"Imagine if you could connect your brain to a machine that would provide ultimate pleasure for the rest of your life. If given the choice to embrace that existence, would you? That’s the question philosopher Robert Nozick posed through a thought experiment called the Experience Machine. The experiment challenges us to envision a world where scientists have created a machine that simulates real life while ensuring only pleasure and no pain. The catch? You must permanently abandon reality, though you’ll barely notice the difference. Your experiences will feel indistinguishable from reality. Life’s natural highs and lows would simply be replaced with endless highs. Sounds perfect, doesn’t it?"

I was consulted to see a woman in her 70s—a retired English professor with pancreatic cancer. I was asked to evaluate her due to her pain, nausea, and vomiting. During our discussion about these symptoms, she inquired whether medical marijuana might help. I reflected on everything I had learned in medical school about it, which didn’t take long because I had learned nothing at all."

As firefighters, my team and I are tasked with saving lives and property from disasters such as car wrecks, house fires, and life-threatening medical emergencies. I am a woman leading a department in a male-dominated profession, and 10 years ago, I decided to expand my medical knowledge by earning a nursing degree. That was because it became clear that the next major threat facing not only my city, but other cities across the country, was not the one-time disaster, where you can rush in like the cavalry, as a firefighter, extinguish the flames and leave, feeling like you’ve made a difference and everything is fine.

288,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,speech,"Where does all the carbon we release go? Carbon operates in a natural cycle, present in all living things: in the soil, in the oceans, in the atmosphere, and in rocks deep underground. When plants and other organisms die, much of their stored carbon returns to the atmosphere until new plants grow and reabsorb it. But over millions of years, some of the carbon stored in ancient trees and marine life turns into rock, while some becomes fossil fuels: coal, oil, and natural gas. Natural events like volcanic eruptions release some of the carbon trapped in rock. Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, also release prehistoric carbon. Today, humans emit around 60 times more carbon than all the volcanoes on Earth each year."

(Cheering) I see all of that and a man who spent a quarter of his life in state prison—six years, to be exact, starting as a teenager on Rikers Island for an act that nearly cost a man his life. But what brought me from there to here wasn’t the punishment I faced as a teenager in adult prison or the harshness of our legal system. Instead, it was the learning environment of a classroom that introduced me to something I hadn’t thought possible for me or our justice system as a whole. A few weeks before my release on parole, a counselor encouraged me to enroll in a new college course offered in the prison."
