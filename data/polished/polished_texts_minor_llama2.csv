But now, there are two exciting new shows that I've been religiously following for the past week. The first, 'Blow Out,' is a unique and captivating concept that defies expectations. Despite its lack of representation of the LGBTQ+ community, hairstylist Jonathan Antin's enthusiasm and vision for a second location of his popular West Hollywood salon in Beverly Hills is infectious. As I flipped through channels, I caught a glimpse of Jonathan excitedly exclaiming, 'I'm going to build the greatest salon in the history of the world!' and I was hooked. Not since 'Rocco' have I found such an entertaining and absurd character on TV."

El Paso Natural Gas Pipeline to Test Market Interest in Mainline ExpansionEl Paso Natural Gas Pipeline to Test Market Interest in Mainline Expansion
The El Paso Natural Gas Pipeline has announced an open season to test market interest in a mainline expansion and to satisfy regulatory concerns that something needs to be done to relieve the apparent capacity constraint at the California border. El Paso has been under significant pressure from regulators and shippers to expand due to enormous demand and skyrocketing prices in California.In a January 3 letter to the pipeline, Daniel M. Adamson, Director of FERC's Office of Energy Projects, urged El Paso to consider modifying its Line 2000 project to ""assist the difficult situation"" now facing the California gas market.""

El Paso Natural Gas Pipeline

The El Paso Natural Gas Pipeline is a major pipeline that transports natural gas from the Permian Basin in West Texas to the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) market in California. The pipeline has a capacity of 1.2 Bcf/d and has been in operation since 1999. However, due to increasing demand and limited pipeline capacity, the pipeline has been facing constraints at the California border"

S&D customers will experience lower electric bills. Assuming the lump sum reimbursement is not included in the implicit energy component, the average for June 2000 through January 2001 is 6.2 cents and the implicit commodity average from February 2001 through December 2001 is 7.3 cents.

At its core, Magic: The Gathering is a social game meant to be enjoyed with friends (or frenemies) - laughing, trash talking, and dropping game-winning bombs. Unfortunately, Wizards of the Coast seems to have overlooked this crucial aspect of the game. If you choose to play with friends, you can't earn gold, and gold is essential. Gold unlocks everything in the game, so it's understandable that they've implemented a daily cap. However, get ready for a lengthy and tedious 1v1 grind against the computer or random opponents, whom you can't even communicate with.

I quite hate pre-quals as they go against the natural progression of storytelling, feeling like a step backwards rather than forwards. While they offer more storywise, the combat feels sloppy and doesn't feel as sharp as Arkham City, with clunky controls and a lack of fluidity. As of writing this recommendation on October 23, 2013, there is a game-breaking bug that prevents a side mission from being completed (the main story is unaffected). Additionally, some gadgets are assigned to ridiculous hotkeys, requiring a lengthy keyboard traverse in the heat of combat, which can be frustrating and potentially break combos."

The elemental stuff and limited ammo forces you to experiment with different weapons. There are plenty of cool, unique weapons that stay viable throughout the game.

The cell-shaded presentation is perfect, and very, very Generation One. But aside from that, it's actually a very fun game. The combat mechanics are extremely well done. Transforming mid-fight is often a necessity, and it's woven seamlessly into combos, making it quite unlike High Moon's excellent War for Cybertron games. Another distinction is the heavy focus on melee combat, but some enemies (e.g. Seekers) require a switch to a ranged blaster."

It's also good to know that the developers are actively working on the game and making regular updates, which suggests that the game will continue to evolve and improve over time.

I can understand how the game might not hold your attention for an extended period of time, especially if you're not particularly interested in battle royale games. However, as you mentioned, it's a good option for a quick fix or a casual gaming experience.

The fact that the creators of the game have an interest in taxidermy, which is the practice of preserving the skin of dead animals, adds to the overall sense of unease and unsettling atmosphere.

Podcasting is a form of digital audio content that has gained popularity in recent years. It is the production and distribution of non-interactive audio content, typically in the form of a series of episodes, that can be downloaded or streamed online. The term ""podcasting"" comes from the fact that the first podcasts were created and distributed on Apple's iPod, but it is not limited to Apple devices.
Adam Curry, a former MTV host and VJ, is often credited as the pioneer of podcasting. He started creating and distributing his own audio content in the early 2000s, and his work helped to popularize the medium.
Podcasting has become a popular way for people to share their thoughts, opinions, and ideas on a wide range of topics, from news and politics to comedy and entertainment. It has also become a way for people to build a community around their content, with listeners subscribing and sharing their favorite shows with others.
The advantages of podcasting include:

These strategies are difficult to detect, as they can evolve rapidly, vary across spammers and products, and often go undetected. Most existing detectors focus solely on detection accuracy, which does not align with the goal of maintaining the trustworthiness of product evaluations. To address these challenges, we formulate a game-theoretic approach where spammers and detectors compete in a minimax game, leading to stable detectors that are resilient to any mixed detection strategies."
202,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"We have developed single-shot shaped pulses for ultra-high fidelity (uh-fidelity) population transfer on a 3-level quantum system in lambda configuration. To ensure high fidelity, we employ the Lewis-Riesenfeld (L-R) method to derive a family of solutions leading to an exact transfer, where the solutions follow a single dynamical mode of the L-R invariant. Among this family, we identify a tracking solution with a single parameter to control simultaneously the fidelity of the transfer, the population of the excited state, and robustness. We define a measure of the robustness of an uh-fidelity transfer as the minimum percentile deviation on the pulse areas at which the infidelity rises above $10^{-4}$. Our shaped pulses exhibit superior robustness to Gaussian and adiabatically-optimized pulses for moderate pulse areas."

Due to nonconvexity, there exist multiple local minima that are not globally optimal, even when the mixture is well-separated. We show that all local minima share the same form of structure, which involves a non-overlapping combination of fitting multiple Gaussians to a single true component and fitting a single Gaussian to multiple true components. Our results apply to the setting where the true mixture components satisfy a certain separation condition, and are valid even when the number of components is over- or under-specified. For Gaussian mixtures with three components, we obtain sharper results in terms of the scaling with the separation between the components."

The first construction, the Berglund-H\""ubsch-Krawitz (BHK) construction, uses another weighted projective space and the quotient of a new hypersurface $x_{m^t}$ inside it by some dual group $g^t$. In the second construction, the Batyrev construction, the mirror partner is constructed as a hypersurface in the toric variety defined by the reflexive polytope dual to the polytope associated with the original Calabi-Yau orbifold.

We utilize a high-order MVS scheme, enabling us to integrate with large time steps far from close encounters while maintaining the same level of accuracy as lower-order methods in the vicinity of close encounters. Our algorithm is able to resolve almost exact collisions (with a mutual separation of a fraction of the physical radius) while using the same time step as in weakly perturbed problems, such as the solar system. We demonstrate the long-term behavior of our algorithm on systems of six super-Earths experiencing strong scattering over 50 kyr.

A widely used tool for detecting entanglement is entanglement witness, where the measurement of the witness operator is guaranteed to be positive for all separable states and can be negative for certain entangled states. In reality, due to the exponentially increasing Hilbert space dimension with respect to the system size, it is very challenging to construct an efficient entanglement witness for general multipartite entangled states. For $n$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-like states, the most robust witness scheme requires $n+1$ local measurement settings and can tolerate up to $1/2$ white noise. As a comparison, the most efficient witness for GHZ-like states only needs two local measurement settings and can tolerate up to $1/3$ white noise."

We present a general method to extract the multipole moments of arbitrary stationary spacetimes and apply it to a large family of horizonless microstate geometries. These spacetimes can break the axial and equatorial symmetry of the Kerr metric, leading to a richer multipolar structure that offers a means to constrain fuzzball models phenomenologically. Our findings indicate that the multipole moments of these spacetimes are typically larger in absolute value than those of a Kerr black hole with the same mass and spin. Current measurements of the quadrupole moment of black-hole candidates provide only limited constraints on fuzzballs, while future gravitational-wave detections of extreme mass-ratio inspirals with the Lisa mission are expected to significantly improve these bounds."
209,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"The paper proposes a new approach to temporal graph attention, called Temporal Graph Attention Networks (TGANs), which are based on temporal point processes and variational autoencoders. The key idea is to learn to infer temporal attention between nodes in a graph by observing the dynamics of node interactions. The proposed approach is motivated by the fact that human-specified edges are often suboptimal for downstream tasks, and can be both expensive to produce and difficult to interpret. By learning to infer temporal attention between nodes, TGANs can provide more flexibility while avoiding these issues.
The proposed TGAN model consists of three main components:
1. Temporal Point Processes: TGAN learns to model the dynamics of node interactions by using temporal point processes, which are non-linear functions that take into account the history of node interactions.2. Variational Autoencoders: TGAN uses variational autoencoders to learn the parameters of the temporal point processes. This allows the model to learn a compact and meaningful representation of the temporal dynamics of node interactions.3. Temporal Attention: TGAN uses a temporal attention mechanism to infer the attention between nodes in the graph, which is based on the similarity of their temporal dynamics.

However, helicity selection rules for diboson scattering amplitudes impose an obstruction to the naïve interference contributions of dimension six operators, causing the total diboson rate correction's leading contribution to cancel. In this case, carefully measuring the azimuthal decay angles ""resurrects"" the interference, recouping sensitivity to the ""non-interfering"" operators. We explore these signatures in detail, and find that the EFT uncertainties associated with higher-dimensional operators are uniquely well-suppressed by the construction of an asymmetry variable which is only generated by these non-interfering operators, relegating the effects of higher-dimensional, interfering operators to the same status as statistical errors in this observable.

Ultracold 2D fermi gases have emerged as clean and controllable model systems to study the interplay of strong correlations and reduced dimensionality, but direct evidence of superfluidity in these systems has been lacking. Here, we demonstrate superfluidity in an ultracold 2D fermi gas by moving a periodic potential through the system and observing no dissipation below a critical velocity v$_{\rm c}$. We measure v$_{\rm c}$ as a function of interaction strength and find a maximum in the crossover regime between bosonic and fermionic superfluidity.

However, a concern with this method is the long-term stability of the implantation-induced conductivity, particularly if the implanted metal species is prone to oxidation. In this study, we investigate the long-term behavior of the surface conductivity of titanium-implanted alumina.

Bhakti Sharma: Imagine, in the scorching Rajasthan heat on a hot summer afternoon, a two-and-a-half-year-old riding on a moped behind her mom, not knowing where they were headed. And 20 minutes later, that two-and-a-half-year-old finds herself completely submerged in water."

""Like many people around the world, earlier this summer, my friends and I were captivated by the Women's World Cup held in France. We were glued to our screens, watching these incredible athletes perform at the top of their game, and the goals were truly amazing. What struck me, however, was the contrast between the excitement and passion on the field and the lack of coverage of the tournament elsewhere. Outside of the field, these women were talking about equal pay and, in some cases, any pay at all for their sport. So, because we were mildly obsessed, we decided to watch the games live, and we found that one of the Spanish-speaking networks in the US was the best place to start. It wasn't until a few games into the tournament that a friend of mine pointed out something peculiar - why did it feel like everything I was seeing was commercials for makeup and household cleaning products and diets?"

They have been using limestone discs called rai stones for money for generations. These stones are made from limestone and are very large, with the largest one weighing around four tons and measuring about 12 feet in diameter. The Yap don't move these stones around or exchange them like we do with coins, because they are too big and heavy to move. Instead, they use the stones to keep track of who owns what part of the stone. There is a story that tells the story of sailors who were transporting a stone across the ocean and it fell into the water, and the Yap have been using the same stone as their money ever since."

Proving your innocence seems impossible, and if you maintain your innocence, you risk being found guilty and executed. However, if you confess, apologize, and implicate others for good measure, you may be set free. This was the difficult choice faced by those accused of witchcraft in the village of Salem, Massachusetts between February 1692 and May 1693. They were victims of paranoia about the supernatural, misdirected religious fervor, and a justice system that prioritized repentance over truth. Salem was settled in 1626 by Puritans, a group of English Protestants who lived a strict and isolated life. Conflicts with their Native American neighbors and groups of French settlers were commonplace."
262,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,speech,"Bioprinting is a revolutionary technology that has the potential to revolutionize the field of organ transplantation by allowing for the creation of customized, artificial organs. Unlike traditional organ transplantation, which relies on finding a matching donor organ, bioprinting involves creating an organ from scratch using a patient's own cells. This eliminates the need for a donor organ shortage and reduces the risk of rejection, as the new organ will be made from the patient's own cells.

Bioprinting works by using a combination of cells, biomaterials, and bioinks to create a three-dimensional (3D) structure that mimics the structure and function of a real organ. The process starts with a detailed scan of the patient's body, which is used to create a digital model of the organ that needs to be replaced. This digital model is then used to create a ""bioink"" that is tailored to the specific needs of the patient. The bioink is a type of ink that contains living cells, such as stem cells, which are programmed to differentiate into the specific type of cells needed for the organ.
Once the bioink is created, it is loaded into a bioprinter, which uses a combination of heat, pressure, and light to deposit the"

I'll try to speak a little bit today about a phenomenon which can, and actually is, changing the world, and whose name is People Power. I'll start with an anecdote, or for those of you who are Monty Python lovers, a Monty Python-type of sketch. Here it is ""It is December 15, 2010. Somebody gives you a bet: you will look at a crystal ball, and you will see the future; the future will be accurate. But you need to share it with the world. Ok, curiosity killed the cat, you take the bet, you look at the crystal ball. One hour later, you're sitting in a building of the national TV, in a top show, and you tell the story."

Currently, the majority of refugees reside in urban areas rather than in refugee camps. According to the United Nations, over 60% of refugees globally are living in urban areas. This highlights the need for a paradigm shift in how we approach the refugee crisis. Rather than investing in the construction of walls, it is crucial to allocate resources towards programs that empower refugees to help themselves and contribute to the development of their host countries.

As a refugee myself, I understand the challenges of leaving behind all one's possessions and starting anew in a foreign land. However, it is important to recognize that refugees possess valuable skills and knowledge that can benefit their host countries. By allowing refugees to utilize their talents and contribute to their host communities, we can foster a more inclusive and mutually beneficial relationship between refugees and their host countries.

I was born in the city of Bukavu, South Kivu, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. As the fifth of 12 children, I have experienced firsthand the challenges of living as a refugee. Despite the difficulties, I am grateful for the opportunity to start a new life in a foreign land and to contribute"

This small metal ball, smaller than two feet in diameter, ignited a space race between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. that would last for eighteen years and transform the world as we know it. Sputnik was not the first piece of human technology to enter space, however. That superlative belongs to the V-2 rocket used by Germany in missile attacks against Allied cities as a last-ditch effort in the final years of World War II. Although it was not very effective, both the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. captured the technology and scientists responsible for its development and began using them for their own projects."

Despite its prevalence, it's common to hear whispers or hushed tones when discussing menstruation. As I speak to you now, millions of women are experiencing their periods, yet it's often treated as an embarrassing or shameful topic. For many, it's a source of discomfort, from the physical symptoms to the social stigma surrounding it. From my perspective and that of the women I've spoken to, it's frustrating to have to navigate through daily life with the added burden of hiding and discretion. It's exhausting to have to carefully conceal sanitary products in a brown paper bag and rush to the bathroom, trying to avoid drawing attention to oneself. The stigma surrounding menstruation can make it difficult to focus on anything else, even during important meetings or classes, as the discomfort and embarrassment can be all-consuming."

Unfortunately, I couldn't find any of them during my visit, but you have their antlers as proof. All across the Boreal, we're blessed with this incredible abundance of wetlands. Wetlands are one of the most endangered ecosystems globally, providing critical ecological services such as cleaning the air, cleaning water, sequestering large amounts of greenhouse gases, and housing a vast array of species."

President Theodore Roosevelt slept among a grove of towering sequoia trees, endured a snowstorm, and spent hours engaging in lively conversation around the campfire with his host and guide, conservationist John Muir. Roosevelt, an ardent lover of the outdoors, was invited by Muir for more than just a camping trip; Yosemite was in danger of overdevelopment. Although the valley was protected land since 1864, it was still at risk of being overrun by developers in 1903. This was the culmination of a long-standing struggle to strike a balance between preservation and public use – two goals that proved challenging to achieve. The battle for Yosemite began in 1849 with the gold rush, when miners flocked west in search of gold in the Sierra Nevada foothills."

One particular incident that stands out occurred a couple of years ago when I was consulted as a consultant to see an elderly woman in her 70s who had pancreatic cancer. She was a retired English professor and was experiencing pain, nausea, and vomiting. During the consultation, she asked me whether I thought medical marijuana might help her.
 I was taken aback by her question, as I had not had any exposure to medical marijuana in my training and had not been aware of its potential therapeutic benefits. I had to admit to her that I knew very little about it, and I thought back to everything I had learned in medical school about medical marijuana, which didn't take very long because I had learned absolutely nothing.

It's moments like these that remind me of the importance of staying up-to-date with the latest research and developments in the field of medicine, particularly when it comes to alternative therapies like medical marijuana.

As a woman leading a male-dominated profession, I have also seen firsthand the importance of having a diverse and inclusive workforce. Ten years ago, I decided to expand my medical knowledge and received a nursing degree. Realizing that the next major threat facing not only my city but other cities across the country, was not the one-and-done disaster, where we can simply ride in, put out the fire, and leave, feeling like we have made a difference and everything is okay, I recognized the need for a more comprehensive approach to emergency response."

Carbon is a vital element that is present in all living things, including soil, oceans, and rocks. When plants and other living things die, their stored carbon is released back into the atmosphere, but some of it becomes fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas. Natural events like volcanic eruptions release some of the carbon trapped in rocks, while human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, release much more than all the volcanoes on Earth combined. Today, humans release around 60 times more carbon than all the volcanoes on the planet each year."

However, one of the key differences between natural and human technologies lies in resilience. Robust systems remain stable in unfamiliar and challenging environments. Remarkably, cockroaches can self-right while running over uneven terrain. When we added a jet pack or subjected them to an earthquake, we discovered that their exquisitely tuned limbs allowed them to self-right without expending any mental energy. They can effortlessly navigate complex terrain, such as grass, without becoming unstable. In fact, we observed a new behavior where, due to their shape, they automatically roll to the side to navigate this artificial test section of grass. Robust systems can perform multiple tasks with the same basic structure. Here's a new behavior we've discovered."

And so, I would like to lift your spirits with one of the great, albeit largely unknown, commercial success stories of the past 20 years. Comparable, in its own very peculiar way, to the achievements of Microsoft or Google. And it's an industry that has bucked the current recession with equanimity. I refer to organized crime.

Now, organized crime has been around for a very long time, I hear you say, and these would be wise words, indeed. But in the last two decades, it has experienced an unprecedented expansion, now accounting for roughly 15 percent of the world's GDP. I like to call it the global shadow economy, or McMafia, for short.

But what got me from there to here wasn't the punishment I faced as a teenager in adult prison or the harshness of our legal system. Instead, it was a learning environment of a classroom that introduced me to something I didn't think was possible for me or our justice system as a whole.

And, like many 20-somethings, I expected to solve the world's water problems — including the world's water quality problems — with my technology. I had a lot to learn.
