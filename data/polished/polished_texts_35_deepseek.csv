Normally, no one would care—certainly not me—but while flipping channels, I glimpsed Jonathan, equally narcissistic and dull, staring at an empty space on Rodeo Dr., declaring (loudly), 'I’ll build the greatest salon in history!' And I was hooked. Not since Rocco has such a moron made compelling TV.""

Re: Loss of Continuity in PX Day-Ahead Auction Due to ISO Rule Changes  

The emergency tariff filing by the California ISO last Friday has negatively impacted the PX day-ahead auction market. The combination of soft and hard caps creates a complete disconnect, posing unacceptable risks to participants and likely failing to achieve the ISO's intended reduction in real-time energy sales and procurement. The overall effect will be that supply will still defer to the higher realized price opportunity the ISO offers. The PX is petitioning Terry Winter of the ISO to immediately permit adjustment bids on any submitted schedule at any relevant price."

Like most parties involved, SoCal Gas is thoroughly exhausted by this dispute. Lad doesn’t anticipate SoCal filing any substantive challenge to the CPUC’s decision.

Starting immediately, Enron has purchased control area reserves service from BPA. This allows services to sell unit contingent energy as hourly firm, since BPA is supplying reserves for up to 60 minutes.  

If Grays Harbor Paper notifies RT of a unit derate or outage, RT should alert BPA dispatch immediately and adjust the schedule during the next ramp. For example, if Grays unit trips at 1333, RT would notify BPA and the sink, reducing the 1400 schedule to zero.

At its core, Magic: The Gathering is a social experience—meant to be enjoyed with friends (or frenemies), trading laughs, banter, and game-winning plays. Wizards of the Coast appears to have overlooked this. If you play with friends, you can't earn gold, which is crucial. Gold is so vital that they've imposed a daily cap—understandable, as it unlocks everything in-game. But prepare for a tedious 1v1 grind against AI or random opponents, with no communication.

""Being the 3rd installment in the trilogy, I’ll address the negatives first. I dislike prequels since they backtrack rather than progress (a common issue). Still, they expand the story. The combat feels sloppy, lacking Arkham City’s precision. As of this review (26/10/2013), a game-breaking bug prevents side mission completion (main story unaffected). Some gadgets have awkward hotkeys, forcing excessive hand movement. It may seem minor, but in combat, it can disrupt your combo.""

Plenty of unique weapons (a key distinction from Borderlands' RNG-heavy approach) remain useful throughout. The music shines, particularly the main theme and Stan Bush's tracks.""

I'm on my first playthrough and lost my main character around hour 10 of 20. I wish I could have reloaded a save at that point. Since then, I've used a third-party mod/save tool to avoid catastrophic failures. The aiming reticle is too small, and the zoom feels underpowered. Despite these issues, it's been a blast. I'm not usually a zombie fan, but the mix of strategy, missions, and first-person combat is fantastic. I play it whenever I can—just one more mission, one more supply run, or escaping to safety before quitting."

The number of units is impressive—not sure exactly how many, but there's a ton! The graphics are stunning, sounds are excellent, and the gameplay is epic. The in-game chat box on the main menu is very entertaining too—no joke. However, if you think this game is 'easy' or are new to the genre, it may take time to master.

The voice actors for Optimus, Megatron, Bumblebee, and others return, instantly recognizable. The iconic transformation sound remains. Graphically, the cel-shaded style is flawless and quintessentially Generation One. Beyond nostalgia, it's genuinely fun. The combat mechanics excel—transforming mid-fight is essential and smoothly integrated into combos, setting it apart from High Moon's *War for/Fall of Cybertron*. Another standout is the emphasis on melee, though some foes (e.g., Seekers) demand ranged attacks.""

The atmosphere is immersive, and the many collectibles do a great job at fleshing it out. I learned a lot about Batman's world, so it was disappointing that the game had so few bosses. Oh well, future titles can rectify that. The combat offers the right level of challenge, though it leans toward the easier side. Leveling up Batman wasn't very satisfying.

All the guns were equally overpowered, so imbalance wasn't an issue—everyone could kill anyone at any time. Plus, the game gave you unlimited gun slots and five loadouts. You'd think a game with 'bajillions of guns' would offer more than 6 weapon slots and 3 loadouts before charging for extras.

Though I anticipated this trend, I tried a melee tank anyway and was pleasantly surprised, leading me to explore more as they unlocked. The art style and interface are oddly endearing.

Specifically, the restriction homomorphisms between these groups in adjacent dimensions are naturally split epimorphisms. These splittings arise from equivariant stable homotopy theory. The equivariant stable homotopy groups of any global spectrum form a global Mackey functor, so the splittings show that certain long exact homotopy group sequences decompose into short exact sequences. For the real and complex global Thom spectra $\mathbf{mo}$ and $\mathbf{mu}$, the splittings imply the regularity of various Euler classes associated with the tautological representations of $O(n)$ and $U(n)$."

214,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"Density-based clustering relies on the idea of linking groups to specific features of the probability distribution underlying the data. The reference to a true, yet unknown, population structure frames the clustering problem in a standard inferential setting, where ideal population clustering is defined as the partition induced by the true density function. The nonparametric formulation of this approach, called modal clustering, establishes a correspondence between groups and the domains of attraction of the density modes. Operationally, a nonparametric density estimate is needed, and selecting the appropriate smoothing level—which governs the density's shape and thus the modal structure—is critical for identifying the final partition. In this work, we address density estimation for modal clustering from an asymptotic perspective."
215,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"The tails of diboson production at the LHC are sensitive to interference between Standard Model predictions and higher-dimension operators parameterizing the effects of heavy new physics. However, helicity selection rules for diboson scattering amplitudes obstruct the na\""ive interference contributions of dimension-six operators, causing the leading diboson rate correction to cancel. In this case, precise measurements of azimuthal decay angles ""resurrect"" the interference, restoring sensitivity to ""non-interfering"" operators. We analyze these signatures in detail and show that EFT uncertainties from higher-dimensional operators are uniquely suppressed by constructing an asymmetry variable generated exclusively by non-interfering operators, reducing the impact of interfering higher-dimensional operators to the level of statistical errors in this observable."

However, academic statistics has often discouraged data analyses with causal objectives. The emergence of ""data science"" offers a historic opportunity to redefine data analysis, naturally incorporating causal inference from observational data. Like others, we categorize data science contributions into three tasks: description, prediction, and counterfactual prediction (encompassing causal inference). A clear classification of these tasks is essential to discuss the necessary data, assumptions, and methods for each.

217,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"The weak gravity conjecture (WGC) demands the existence of superextremal particles in any consistent quantum theory of gravity. The standard lore is that these particles ensure extremal black holes are either unstable or marginally stable, but it remains unclear what goes wrong if this fails. This note demonstrates that, for a generic Einstein quantum theory of gravity in AdS, exact stability of extremal black branes conflicts with rigorously proven quantum information theorems about entanglement entropy. Avoiding this contradiction yields a nonperturbative version of the WGC, which reduces to the usual statement at weak coupling. The argument is general, relying neither on supersymmetry nor a specific UV completion, and assumes only the validity of Einsteinian gravity, effective field theory, and holography."
218,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"Understanding how strongly correlated two-dimensional (2D) systems can lead to unconventional superconductivity with high critical temperatures remains a major challenge in condensed matter physics. Ultracold 2D Fermi gases have emerged as clean and controllable platforms to investigate the interplay of strong correlations and reduced dimensionality, yet direct evidence of superfluidity in these systems has been lacking. Here, we demonstrate superfluidity in an ultracold 2D Fermi gas by moving a periodic potential through the system and observing no dissipation below a critical velocity v$_{\rm c}$. We measure v$_{\rm c}$ as a function of interaction strength and find a peak in the crossover regime between bosonic and fermionic superfluidity. Our results establish ultracold Fermi gases as a powerful tool for probing the influence of reduced dimensionality on strongly correlated superfluids."

Transverse momentum-dependent skew tunneling of Cooper pairs through the spin-active ferromagnetic insulator interface generates significant transverse Hall supercurrents, termed anomalous Josephson Hall effect currents. We extend the Furusaki-Tsukada formula, originally developed to quantify conventional (tunneling) Josephson currents, to assess the transverse components and show their amplitudes are highly tunable via spin-orbit coupling strengths or the superconducting phase difference across the junction. As a distinct spectroscopic signature of Josephson junctions, well-localized subgap bound states emerge near the interface.""

Turbul. 2020) that dipoles are as crucial to decaying two-dimensional turbulence dynamics as individual vortex cores, we find the kinetic energy of this flow is carried by elongated streams formed by dipole concatenation. Vortices separate into small, fast-moving cores and larger, slow-moving ones, which appear 'frozen' into a gradually evolving 'crystal.' The kinematics of both families differ significantly, with only the former being self-similar. The latter holds most of the flow's kinetic energy, forming dipoles and streams.

Specifically, we apply our techniques to the glued-trees problem, enhancing the hitting time upper bound by a polynomial factor: from $o(n^5)$ to $o(n^2\log n)$.

I painted myself white, stood on a box, placed a hat or can at my feet, and when someone dropped in money, I handed them a flower—along with intense eye contact. If they didn’t take it, I added a gesture of sadness and longing as they walked away."
269,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"On October 4, 1957, the world watched in awe as the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the first artificial satellite, into space. This small metal sphere, less than two feet in diameter, ignited a space race between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. that would last eighteen years and transform the world. Sputnik wasn’t the first human-made object in space—that distinction belongs to Germany’s V-2 rocket, used in WWII attacks. Though ineffective, by war’s end, both the U.S. and U.S.S.R. had seized the technology and its creators, harnessing them for their own ambitions."

But why? As I speak to you now, over 800 million women worldwide are menstruating. None of us would exist without it, yet it remains an ""embarrassing"" topic. From my experience and that of women around me, I can say it’s exhausting. Exhausting to carefully pull out a pad hidden in a brown paper bag, stuff it into your pocket mid-class, and rush discreetly to the washroom. Exhausting to sit through lessons or meetings pretending everything’s fine while silently enduring intense cramps.""

Spanning northern Canada, including Labrador, it shelters the world's last great caribou herd—the George River herd, with roughly 400,000 animals. Sadly, during my visit, I couldn’t spot a single one, though the antlers serve as proof. Across the boreal, we’re graced with an abundance of wetlands. Globally among the most endangered ecosystems, wetlands are vital—purifying air and water, sequestering greenhouse gases, and hosting immense biodiversity."

One day, while the supreme spirit Yaya tended his gardens, Deminan and his brothers sneaked into Yaya’s house. After feasting and exploring, they noticed a giant gourd hanging in the corner.

I attended a career fair on campus, where I secured an interview with a start-up called Theranos. At the time, little was known about the company, but the available information was impressive. Essentially, they were developing a medical device capable of running a full blood panel from just a finger-stick. This meant no more large needles for blood tests—making the process not only less painful but also potentially enabling predictive diagnostics."

All my time was spent outdoors with the Inuit, playing. The snow and ice were my sandbox, and the Inuit were my teachers. That’s where I became truly obsessed with this polar realm.""

To achieve this, I must explain something about the solar system's origin. Four and a half billion years ago, there was a cloud of gas and dust. At its center, our Sun formed and ignited. Around it, planets, comets, and asteroids took shape. According to theory, once Earth cooled after its formation, comets bombarded it, delivering water. They likely also brought complex organic material, potentially sparking the emergence of life."

""In 1903, the President of the United States embarked on a three-day camping trip in California’s Yosemite Valley. President Theodore Roosevelt slept among towering sequoias, weathered a snowstorm, and spent evenings by the campfire with his host, conservationist John Muir. Roosevelt cherished the outdoors, but Muir’s invitation served a greater purpose: Yosemite was under threat. Although designated protected land in 1864, the valley faced overdevelopment by 1903. It was central to a long-standing effort to preserve land for both conservation and public use—goals far harder to achieve than declare. The conflict over Yosemite traces back to the 1849 Gold Rush, when miners flocked west, scouring the Sierra Nevada foothills for gold."

The scenario invites us to envision a world where scientists have created a device simulating real life, ensuring only pleasure and no pain. The catch? You must abandon reality permanently, though you’d hardly notice. Your experiences would feel indistinguishable from real life. Life’s natural highs and lows would simply be replaced by constant euphoria. Sounds perfect, doesn’t it?""

Yet one key distinction between natural and human technologies lies in robustness. Robust systems remain stable in complex, unfamiliar environments.

When fitted with a jet pack or subjected to disturbances like earthquakes, their finely tuned legs enable them to stabilize effortlessly, without cognitive input. They traverse complex terrain like grass effortlessly, maintaining stability. We observed a novel behavior where their body shape allows them to roll sideways automatically to navigate artificial grass patches. Robust systems can perform multiple tasks with the same structure—here's a new discovery."
