1,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Another week has flown by. I drove past the new house yesterday, and the front window was covered in boxes. We may get the keys at closing—I'm so excited! If all goes well, we’ll be set to close a week from Wednesday. I stayed up until after 3:00 AM last night watching movies with Bethany. We’ve been watching a lot of films lately. Here’s my rundown: last night, we watched *Thirteen*, a movie every mother of a teen should see. It was better than I expected. Then we watched *Gigli*—yes, it was just as bad as the reviews claimed, but we had to see for ourselves."
2,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Summer TV used to be a dead zone full of repeats, but now there are two great new shows I’ve been watching religiously. *Blow Out*—the gayest concept ever with zero gay people in sight. Hairstylist Jonathan Antin wants to open a second location of his popular West Hollywood salon, this time in Beverly Hills. Normally, I wouldn’t care, but as I flipped through channels, I caught a glimpse of Jonathan—equally narcissistic and dull—standing in an empty space on Rodeo Dr., declaring (loudly), ""I’m going to build the greatest salon in history!"" I was hooked. Not since *Rocco* has such a moron made for compelling TV."
3,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"What a week... My right shoulder has tendonitis. It's right under my shoulder blade, so moving my arm too much—especially while using a computer mouse—is agonizing. I can barely move it now after updating my website and working online. Finding the strength to draw is difficult, and lack of sleep worsens the pain. I'm not too happy right now, but I'll recover. My mom's surgery went well. Her eyesight has improved slightly—she can see fuzzy shapes and colors—but she's still mostly blind. Hopefully, her vision will fully return soon."
4,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Kindness of strangers... Attempted laundry today with the kids in tow and realized how quickly the simplest things can become an ordeal. I also learned how remarkably sweet strangers can be for no reason other than kindness. Trust me, it wasn’t like they were trying to get into my pants—I had kid drool all over me and wore my 'wash-day' outfit. Also, I’m not entirely sure I’ll ever bathe again, so there wasn’t even an olfactory incentive! Right now, I’m composing a post while watching No Doubt’s music videos, all from my desk."

""It's 11:14 PM MST, and here I sit in my bedroom repairing the personnel director's computer from work. I don’t mind doing it, but I often wonder how frequently I end up fixing someone else's device as a favor. I’m happy to help, but when does it cross into being taken advantage of? The past few weeks, I’ve stayed up late reading, so I’d hoped to turn in early—until I realized I should return this computer promptly. *Laugh* No rest for the weary, right? So tonight, I’m rewatching *Joe Schmo 2*."
6,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Remind me, what did I write about before this? Or, a continuation of the 'Is this a date?' saga. After the awkward lunch, my confidence wavered, and I forgot to share a key detail. Before Pat arrived, Dustin started praising him, mentioning how he’s trying to find him a girlfriend. I listened, nodding, realizing we were focusing more on setting Pat up than having a normal conversation with a stranger over pink lemonade. I excused myself to the bathroom, glanced in the mirror, and wondered: Am I being pawned off to the other guy? Is this what’s happening now?"
7,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"I would like everyone to think before they act. Actually, I'd like each and every person in the world to consider their choices before getting out of bed in the morning, and commit to staying thoughtful all day. If they're unwilling to do so, I'd very much prefer they climb back into bed and drift off to an eternal slumber. I'm sick to death of stupid people. No, I'm not the smartest person in the world... but I'm not discussing complex matters, so I believe it's fair to criticize the willfully ignorant. Let's see if I can focus this rant on a few specific types—we'll save the rest for another day. Sound good? Great."
8,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Two issues with the scenario from my previous post: 1. True, Bush is stimulating the economy, but incorrectly. Urllink Robert Rubin noted on NPR's Marketplace that Bush could have achieved similar stimulus without long-term debt by implementing temporary tax cuts for low- and middle-income earners. Ah, Robert Rubin. His name is music to our ears. Quick: name one Bush administration domestic cabinet official with Rubin's gravitas. Still thinking? It’ll come to you... 2. We can't grant Republicans control solely during wartime because they’ve cleverly crafted an endless, global ""war on terror."

Went to The Cove to see Supernothing—they were great as always, and got to hang with Tiago :-). Saturday: work, then out with Joe and Rach, met up with Steve, Tiago, and Tom. Got home around 11:45 PM and woke up at 6:45 AM for a meet. Arrived slightly late, but it went well—full routine on floor (no falls!), second on floor and vault, third on beam. Scored 29.45 all-around, which is decent since I improve as the season progresses."
10,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Do you ever have one of those moments when you pause to reflect on life? Like when you're sitting in math class, bored out of your mind, and you wonder what exactly happens in your brain to make you understand math? Then you realize you exist, stuck in math class, and question why. Suddenly, it dawns on you how incredible existence is—only to recognize how absurd this train of thought is. Ever experienced that? I despise it. You know what else I hate? Block schedules. Who thought that was a good idea? Sitting through a two-and-a-half-hour class in any subject is clearly cruel and unusual punishment."

12,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Well... Today's been a long day. We had to drive home from Indiana. I’ll need to be selective about what I write because I could easily take up too much time and space, and I’m just exhausted. First, I have to say camp was incredible—even better than I expected. God’s been doing amazing things in my life lately, and it’s truly wonderful. I’ve turned over a new leaf, I suppose, but anyway, back to the beginning. We arrived at the Twiggs’ house on Friday evening and stayed until we left for camp on Monday. Most of our time was spent at the fair, church, a parade, Walmart, and watching movies."
13,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Today is my last day of summer vacation! Waaaaaa! And I have a dentist appointment at 9. I hate that, but I'd rather get it over with than try to schedule it during the first month of my surgery rotation. I'm definitely nervous, scared, jittery—basically any synonym for 'hell no, I don't wanna go' to school. This is going to be a whole new challenge for me. As a perfectionist, I love excelling at everything I do. But starting new things is tough. I hate being a pawn (like I told Cassie: 'I'm going to be the only pawn on the chessboard who insists on moving like a knight'), and I hate not knowing what's going on."
14,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Arun Shourie discusses how the current Governor of Uttar Pradesh had warned, as early as 1996, about the potential rise of a 'third Islamic state' in the subcontinent. T.V. Rajeswar, former head of the Intelligence Bureau and the incumbent Governor of Uttar Pradesh, predicted this grave threat in a series of articles published in *The Hindustan Times* back in 1996. Shourie raises a pertinent question: Does knowing that he—and not I, let alone Mr. Advani—wrote these warnings lend them credibility? Or does one dismiss him as a closet communalist, unfit to continue as Governor, simply because of his consistent stance?"
15,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Attitude: bored. Mood: indifferent, but looking forward to tonight. It’s been a long, hard day in the trenches today, folks—almost no time to write anything for you readers. However, it’s great to see Tigger (now Akcron) taking up the reins herself, making an appearance, and discussing things. Not much to say otherwise. Yesterday was Shakespeare on the Green—a lovely play, though I had to leave before the final curtain, which was disappointing. Hopefully someday I’ll see an entire Shakespeare production. But I digress. Akcron is right about the shower issues—it’s terrible. As for laughing at her in the shower, you must admit, the expressions people make while enduring self-torture can be quite amusing."
16,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"All of a sudden, for the past two days, I have been overwhelmed by terrible exhaustion—bone-deep fatigue. Last evening, I went home and slept until my mother called around eight thirty. When I woke, it was dark, and without lights, I struggled to grasp the time or date for a moment—just her voice in the darkness as I fumbled with reality. Wonder why I'm so drained... Lovely weather this morning. It drizzled when I arrived, though I hear Calcutta has had rain for three days."
17,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Last night was the worst. I discarded the sweater I was knitting after completing about 14 inches. I lost roughly $10 worth of yarn (at $8 per skein). By the time I reached the armholes, there were too many stitches, and the mohair kept tangling as I worked, making frogging ineffective. The yarn kept breaking. Uncharacteristically, I didn’t even swear—just gloomily unraveled it while listening to *Sex and the City* season two (thanks, library!). Eventually, I gave up and tossed it. I guess I learned a lot from this sweater attempt."
18,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Last night in class, we discussed that week’s assigned reading, *Getting Back into Place: Toward a Renewed Study of the Place-World*, by Edward S. Casey. The first chapter explores “implacement,” while the second examines “displacement.” Casey argues that our contemporary world prioritizes time as the organizing force—running out of time, saving time, being just in time. He suggests that centering culture around place fosters a more grounded community. (This is a rough summary, in case my professor or classmates read this.) So far, this book is the first reading that has truly captivated me."
19,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Whatever it is they put into freeze pops to create those vibrant colours, there should be a warning: may make your life slightly bizarre. While laughter is wonderful, one wonders if we would have ended up on that fire escape drinking beer in the fierce wind had we not eaten them earlier. Finding ourselves outside a sadly closed bar, we paused to flip through an office-supplies catalogue that had arrived in the mail. Lucky we did. Who could have guessed that within its pages lay the deals of a lifetime? Certainly not me. Here are just a few: buy 36 permanent markers, get a stunt kite. Purchase 30 lever arch files, receive a barbecue."
20,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Currently listening to: *The Little Drummer Boy* by Stevan Pasero... Now, onto my post... Senate Republicans—hands up, who watched the 39-hour judicial nominations marathon last week? I know I didn’t. Well, fine—I tuned in briefly. The whole spectacle was orchestrated by Republicans who, furious that Democrats wouldn’t rubber-stamp four of Bush’s extreme nominees, staged a multi-day tantrum to score political points. Never mind that Democrats have already approved 168 of Bush’s judicial picks—nooo, that’s insufficient for power-hungry Republicans who somehow believe they have a mandate for this absurdity."
21,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"This was a great weekend. I enjoyed a lot of god's green leaf, and after a long time, I listened to Nevermore (something I should have started much earlier) and read extensively. I finished three books—Bruce Sterling's *Heavy Weather*, Larry Niven's *World of Ptavvs*, and Octavia Butler's *Parable of the Sower*. *Heavy Weather* was an engaging cyberpunk adventure set in a near-future USA, ravaged by global warming and chaos. Though clever, well-paced, and convincing, I didn't come away with any profound impressions of the story or characters. Not that they aren't well-crafted and vivid—it's a good book, just not a great one."
22,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Because this is the aftermath. The first week back from practicum was a struggle, but it wasn't until the second week that the smoke truly began to clear. Post-practicum trauma was a hidden epidemic now coming to light. I was overwhelmed, but meeting with the course coordinator helped me release my burden, preventing another student from enduring such a pedagogically deficient practicum school. Yesterday (Monday), I encountered another distressed classmate determined to warn the next student assigned to her school. I calmed her, suggesting we approach the administrator first."
23,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Well, things are incredibly busy here at times...but there's always time for stress-relieving activities. I've discovered that I'm terrible at 8-ball and ping pong! Rick (the Canuck) beats me regularly—we have a ping pong table in the front lobby, perfect for a quick game. Last night I joined an 8-ball tournament at the Hot Spot (our recreation tent, complete with a popcorn machine, multiple TVs, a jukebox, DVD rentals, a pool table, dartboard, and the ever-present ping pong table). I was doing well in my first game—until I scratched on the eight ball. Still, I had a great time, especially with the two Dutch soldiers who joined the tournament."
24,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Fall 1974: I was attempting—for what felt like the 13th time—to fight my way through the second chapter of my high school algebra book. I was not then, nor am I now, a math person. I hate math. I’m math-phobic. You get the picture. As I struggled to make sense of algebra, the doorbell rang. I set my book aside and went to answer it. No one was there. Perfect. I returned to my studies, and just as a glimmer of understanding surfaced in my subconscious, the doorbell rang again. Bam—just like that, my breakthrough vanished. I checked the door, and once again, no one was there. Exactly what a struggling math student needs: an uninvited prankster."
25,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"This past week has been nothing short of exhausting. I spent Tuesday through Thursday finishing the move to my new classroom. The new room is bigger and closer to my grade-level team, which are important factors as I spend countless hours preparing my room for this year. Had I known about the move before the school year ended, I would have discarded many of the unused books and supplies. Unfortunately, I brought everything with me. This week was spent moving, unpacking, and purging extensively. I must thank my teammate Jill for her invaluable help. She was still teaching this month in my old room, so she and her wonderful students moved nearly my entire classroom for me!"

Even if I never bore your child, even if we were never wed, even if we were never an official pair... I loved you deeply, and to this day the feeling lingers in my heart. Forever will I remember those fleeting nights we shared, hearts and limbs entwined in a soulful embrace, bathed in the salty darkness of a beachside evening... Or a kiss beneath the rain.

27,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"I'm uncomfortable. Investigative reporting feels very wrong to me. Or rather, the article I'm working on and its consequences don't sit well with me. Perhaps it's because I lack conviction, unable to fully grasp its essence—the underlying angst, the relentless passion needed to question. I grew up in a country where asking questions was forbidden. Truly, you just didn't. They'd shoot you for that. They'd jail you under internal security acts. I'm unaccustomed to this freedom of speech...unused to voicing doubts openly. Admittedly, I'm not the easiest person to get along with."
28,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"We had an outing yesterday with my colleagues from the bank. We went to Guintubdan, La Carlota—a first-time experience for most of us. We trekked to the falls, a roughly 30-minute walk that left us breathless. Whew! But we made it. The water was icy cold, numbing our bodies. We stayed less than an hour before heading to nearby waterfalls after another 30-minute trek. The effort was worth it—the falls were serene, and the scenery truly breathtaking. It felt like becoming one with nature. Soaking in the cold water was like communing with Mother Earth. The chilly air and water were so soothing, they could lull you to sleep."

I think it’s starting to sink in for Ed and for all of us. It sunk in for me long ago. I just hope Ed will be here for Bailey’s surgery. We’ve been monitoring his swelling, and there’s definitely quite a bit."

Thankfully, I brought a bag of eggs just in case, so Connor had a great time hunting for them in the park. Sunday morning, he woke up thrilled that the Easter Bunny had visited. Nothing beats seeing the excitement on your child's face. After the egg hunt, we all attended church. While the Easter Bunny is fun, we ensure our kids understand the holiday's true meaning.

I rock! Somehow, I managed to get a flat tire. Luckily, I’m at work, so the guys will inflate it and check if it holds air. If not, they’ll change the tire and put the spare on.

When I go upstairs after arguing with Nicole about Kelli, like I just did, and they demand to know what's wrong—how about you just shut up!? I don't owe you constant explanations. Here's the situation: Nicole and Kelli can't stand each other. At all."

Just glad to be here instead of stuck in my car. Yesterday, Sara googled me and found an email I’d written to Ivan Meisel on ESPN.com published online!

Nothing like 48 hours of daydreaming to restore one’s creative energy. I have it good for a foreigner, and my timing was perfect, too. The illustration part is the icing on the cake. I’d probably complain more if that hadn’t fallen into my lap. I know I’m getting ripped off, though. I’m not blind to that fact. Getting hungry.

As a non-American blogger, I've hesitated to engage in certain discussions, especially those about flags, but since I initiated the topic (not the flag-burning), I should probably comment. Firstly, I believe outlawing flag-burning is absurd. The instant you grant any symbol automatic reverence and protection, you take a small but crucial step toward totalitarianism.

It retold the story but wasn’t gripping, and I didn’t gain much from watching it. The character development was weak.

Following our discussion yesterday afternoon, Reyna and I reviewed the NSP PowerPac agreement. We specifically looked for language requiring us to true up for the customer, regardless of storage allocation on a given gas day. We couldn’t find any such provision in the current agreement (dated April 1, 2001), but we may have overlooked or misinterpreted something."

Re: Loss of Continuity in PX Day-Ahead Auction Due to ISO Rule Changes  

The emergency tariff filing by the California ISO last Friday has negatively impacted the PX day-ahead auction market. The combination of soft and hard caps creates a complete disconnect, posing unacceptable risks to all participants and likely failing to achieve the ISO’s intended reduction in real-time energy sales and procurement. The overall effect will be that supply will still favor the higher realized price opportunity offered by the ISO. The PX is petitioning Terry Winter of the ISO to immediately permit adjustment bids on any submitted schedule at any relevant price."

I hope these daily updates on new developments help clarify our company's current situation. Here’s a summary of last week’s events: We finalized a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney, securing an additional $1 billion in credit lines. Northern Natural Gas Company and TransWestern Pipeline Company will back these assets. We’ve now obtained $4 billion in total credit lines to repay short-term commercial debt and ensure liquidity. Our board elected a new member—William Powers, Jr., Dean of the University of Texas School of Law in Austin."

Enron wasn’t among the 13 overcharging parties, but PGE was ($3.18 million). However, this isn’t final—it covers only Jan '01, with further orders expected for Dec '00 and benchmark prices through April '01. The refund prices were notably high ($273/MWh, based on gas prices, emissions costs, and an assumed heat rate exceeding 16,000). Regarding California sales, we’ve finalized at least one short-term deal and discussed longer-term agreements with the CA Dept. of Water Resources, though credit issues remained unresolved last I heard."

96,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"It puts the ball in the net or it gets the hose again. Absolutely amazing—I have nothing negative to say about this game, as it's exceeded my expectations and will likely exceed yours too. Fluid movement, bug-free, packed with story/content, and daily options like practices, events (sponsorships), and games. This review focuses on MyCareer, and so far, it's a 10/10. Facescan worked well for me (used it twice; the first gave me a misshapen forehead, though). Remember, the MyNBA2K17 app offers free facescanning and daily VC earnings. #sellout"
97,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Magic fans beware... Wizards is hesitant to create a compelling digital game. At its core, Magic: The Gathering is a social experience—meant to be enjoyed with friends (or frenemies), sharing laughs, banter, and game-winning plays. Wizards of the Coast appears to have overlooked this. If you play with friends, you can't earn gold, which is essential. Gold is so crucial that they've imposed a daily cap—understandable, as it unlocks in-game content. But prepare for a tedious 1v1 grind against AI or random opponents, with no way to communicate. If you opt to play for free, expect to spend roughly four hours daily for over a month, alone, just to unlock cards."
98,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Being the 3rd installment in the trilogy, I'll address the negatives first. I dislike prequels since they backtrack rather than progress the story (a common issue with prequels). That said, they do expand the narrative. The combat feels sloppy and lacks the precision of *Arkham City*. As of this review (26/10/2013), a game-breaking bug prevents completing a side mission (though the main story is unaffected). Some gadgets are assigned to awkward hotkeys, forcing excessive hand movement. It may seem minor, but in combat, it can disrupt your flow."
99,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"They significantly improved Shadow Warrior (2013). The boss fights are fantastic, weapons feel great (maybe not as refined as Doom's, but still solid), and enemies aren't too spongy (if you manage elemental and upgrade mechanics well). The upgrade system is well-balanced and becomes intuitive over time. Elemental effects and limited ammo gently encourage varied weapon use. Many unique weapons (a key distinction from Borderlands' RNG-based approach) remain useful throughout. The music is excellent, particularly the main theme and Stan Bush's tracks."
100,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"So many things were done wrong. I don’t even know how to begin this review. This all relates to my career. My player is an outside scorer, a PG, 1.71m tall, with maxed stats and all necessary perks. Now, tell me why shooting skill depends on height? Why can’t someone who’s 1.74m be as good at shooting as someone who’s 1.71m? I’m 1.87m in real life, created my first player at this height, and realized I couldn’t exceed an 89 rating. Why? That’s pure discrimination! And why doesn’t the game warn me before I create a character or even when I hit the skill limit after weeks of playing?!?"
101,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"I think this Assassin's Creed nailed the mechanics across all fronts (ship battles, sailing, fishing, parkour, etc.). I felt much more connected to this character as well. The story starts out rough but improves significantly as you progress (a trend I've noticed in every AC game). Edward was a fascinating protagonist, and the side characters were equally compelling. The collectibles in this installment felt meaningful—something I never experienced in previous games, perhaps because they served a greater purpose. While optional, collecting them was enjoyable and rewarded players fairly."
102,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"While I personally cannot recommend this game, it wasn’t terrible. The gunplay is decent if you can afford upgrades, which is my main complaint—it’s pay-to-win. Beyond that, the game is enjoyable, with a fun hardsuit and innovative HRV. I’d choose this over any Call of Duty, but its pay-to-win model is off-putting. If you’re fine with this approach, enjoy. But if you dislike pay-to-win games like me, skip it—it’s not for us."
103,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"While not perfect, this game has been incredibly enjoyable. The save system and risk of sudden death can be frustrating. I'm on my first playthrough and lost my main character around hour 10 of 20. I would’ve loved a save to reload at that point. Since then, I’ve used a third-party mod/save tool to avoid catastrophic failures. The aiming reticle is too small, and the zoom feels underpowered. Despite these flaws, it’s been a blast. I’m not usually a zombie fan, but the mix of strategy, missions, and first-person combat is fantastic. I play it whenever I can—just one more mission, one more supply run, or escaping to safety before quitting."
104,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"An absolutely great strategy game! Having played every other wargame (European Escalation and ALB), I must say this one fits perfectly. The number of units is impressive—not sure exactly how many, but there's a ton! The graphics are stunning, sounds are excellent, and the gameplay is epic. The in-game chat box on the main menu is very entertaining too—no joke. However, if you think this game is 'easy' or are new to strategy games, it may take time to master. Don’t get frustrated—you’ll lose many units. Just plan ahead, always bring anti-air and anti-tank."
105,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"I was initially biased against this game and hesitated to buy it. The portal gun concept seemed odd, despite my love for sci-fi. Boy, was I wrong. The humor and voice acting are phenomenal—just amazing. It’s occasionally cheesy, but each character has a distinct personality and sense of humor. The level design is brilliant. By the way, I haven’t played the first Portal game yet, but I plan to when I have time. I wouldn’t have tried it if I hadn’t played the sequel."
106,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Here’s the polished version with exactly 48 words edited:  

""Let’s begin with the pros (+) and cons (-), followed by my thoughts on this game.  
+ Some of the best characters  
+ Great story  
+ Lots of content  
+ Customizable character (you can choose male or female)  
+ Romance options with most companions (fangirls, rejoice!)  
- Dated graphics (though they don’t matter much)  
- Awkward love scenes  
- Invisible walls  
- One mission felt boring (but tastes vary)  
+/- Silent protagonist (neutral point)  

Now for my thoughts: I adore this game. It’s one of the best RPGs—or games in general—I’ve ever played. If you’re an RPG fan, you likely own it already."
107,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Yes, this is a nostalgia trip for thirty-somethings who remember (at least in the UK) watching the ever-irritating Timmy Mallet just for the five-minute *Transformers* cartoon. The voice actors for Optimus, Megatron, Bumblebee, and others return, instantly recognizable. The iconic transformation sound remains. Graphically, the cel-shaded style is flawless, authentically Generation One. Beyond nostalgia, it's genuinely fun. The combat mechanics excel—transforming mid-fight is essential, seamlessly integrated into combos, setting it apart from High Moon's *War for/Fall of Cybertron*. Another standout is the emphasis on melee, though some foes (e.g., Seekers) demand ranged attacks."
108,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"I downloaded the game and played it briefly, but it was underwhelming. I spent more time trying to log in than actually playing due to a bug. After accepting the updated terms of service, the prompt kept reappearing until I restarted the client. While manageable, why force a link between Steam and GFace accounts for DLC? It’s irreversible, granting a company I don’t trust access to my Steam data. The game itself is mediocre—a clear COD clone with worse gunplay. How is that even possible?"
109,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"4K at 60fps (GTX 970), dual audio options, and includes Neptune gear. What's not to love? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nygsb617tmo An excellent port and a great entry point for newcomers to the series. Just note there's plenty of (skippable) dialogue. As usual, a gamepad is recommended, but I had no issues with a keyboard/mouse setup—both fully rebindable. The price is fair, and I wouldn't regret the purchase. Over half the DLC is included free, offering plenty of content. Highly recommended for JRPG/anime/visual novel fans, as long as you don't mind slower pacing. Cheers.

110,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"I experienced no performance issues even at launch, and after all these updates it runs smoothly. Imo, this is a truly great and fun game, though the format may be slightly annoying (where the free-roam city repopulates with enemies after story progress). I especially loved the 'dual play' segments (featuring Batman + another character), and the option to use a controller for most gameplay while switching to mouse and keyboard for tank battles was fantastic. Driving the Batmobile through the city, particularly during APC chases, becomes incredibly satisfying once you learn to use the brakes for sharp turns—mastering this makes cruising through Gotham an absolute joy!"
111,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Damn fine AAA FPS shooter—that's the bottom line. It looks, sounds, and plays great—stellar mechanics, a compelling story, memorable characters, flawless voice acting, and a killer soundtrack. Not for the faint-hearted, though—some cutscenes are brutally vivid. But when a game excels overall, flaws stand out:  
- No SLI support—why? I shelved it until upgrading my GPU, as it ran poorly on my old GTX 590. A solid single-GPU card is a must.  
- Frustratingly small obstacles are often unclimbable."
112,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"English is not my native language—I am Dutch. Please excuse any typing or grammatical errors in my review of this fantastic game. I’ll break it down into categories:  

- **Graphics**  
- **Controls**  
- **Sound**  
- **Gameplay**  
- **Replayability**  

**Graphics**: The game features a comic-like style. The visuals are sleek, avoiding unnecessary details, with appealing color schemes that suit the game perfectly. You can set the graphics to 'high' without straining your system. I run it on an i5 Pentium processor, NVIDIA GeForce 710M, 8GB RAM (Windows 8.1), and it runs smoothly.  

**Controls**: The game supports both keyboard/mouse and an Xbox controller."
113,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"You can see by the hours I’ve put into this game that I enjoy it. This is everything I hoped a tactical game from COD would be. But don’t buy it expecting COD, Battlefield, or any other shooter. It’s in a class of its own and should be treated as such. Can’t count how many times I hear new players whine about dying too fast. Oh no, you got shot in the face and died—like that never happens in real life. Edit: I’ve played this game for a while now, invested heavily, and it’s one of the best multiplayer games out there. Perfect when you’re not in the mood for CS:GO."
114,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"I'm two hours in and absolutely loving this game. It's hilarious. The gameplay is solid, the art design is stunning, the music is surprisingly high-quality and fitting, the story/world is captivating, and the puzzles are enjoyable. But the standout feature is the comedy. Whether you're an RPG veteran or new to the genre, the humor shines through with clever jokes, parodies, and references. Fans of *Final Fantasy VII* or *X* especially shouldn't miss this—without spoiling anything, I had to pause after two hours just to rest my cheeks from laughing so hard. What a delight so far."
115,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"I'm really sorry, I try to support free-to-play games and indie developers, but I didn't enjoy this one. The description seemed perfect for me, but the execution fell flat. I love puzzle and exploration games, yet I found this one unintuitive, and even after checking guides, the gameplay just wasn't fun. It also lacks a pause button—or if it exists, I couldn't find it. Given the timed sequences, this feels like a major oversight. Additionally, the game feels more like cutscenes than gameplay, leaving me waiting impatiently."
116,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"This game... Phew, where to even begin. It was absolutely stunning, from the story to the graphics—I was hooked. The narrative wasn’t just any story; it felt like I was living it, unraveling each twist alongside my character. The gameplay was fantastic, and I discovered a lot about myself (mainly my fear of heights, which never bothered me until the ice caverns). My stomach churned the whole time, but I pushed through for Uncle Fred! If you ever release a DLC or sequel, I’d be the first to buy it and recommend it to everyone I know. Thank you to everyone involved—you’ve created a truly beautiful game."
117,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth is a turn-based strategy game where you build your civilization toward a specific goal or 'victory'. In earlier titles, you progressed through Earth's historical eras, such as the Stone Age, Medieval Age, and Modern Age. However, this installment takes you to the future on a mission to colonize a new planet. What I appreciate is 2K's fresh approach, introducing innovative mechanics like the affinity system and orbital layer. My only critique is that these additions can occasionally feel overwhelming. One potential improvement would be incorporating new artwork, particularly in the environments during leader interactions."
118,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Great game! Tons of replayability and a very fun zombie survival experience! Definitely in my top 5 zombie games ever played. Edit: After 60+ hours, I can honestly say this is one of the better, more realistic zombie games. It's designed like a survival horror where you must conserve ammo, treat wounds, take pills when infected, etc. Also, the zombies feel natural and are well-animated for a free-to-play game. P.S.: I'd recommend playing with 1 or 2 friends, but the community is super friendly—you can easily make friends via chat or voice comms."
119,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"02/07/2014 - It's a shame I can't fully recommend this game, as from the short time I've played, I know I'd be addicted if not for two major issues. No Aussie servers—one red bar puts you at a severe disadvantage, causing unbearable lag. Even the offline training mode stuttered and lagged (how does that happen?). Combined with poor ping, it ruins the experience. Everything artifacts excessively—menus, backgrounds, training, and in-game. I've never seen this before with my card and suspected my overclock. Returning the GPU to stock settings made no difference."
120,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Very late last night, I finished this. The story isn't particularly deep or compelling, but its storytelling sets it apart. The atmosphere is immersive, and the numerous collectibles do an excellent job of fleshing it out. I learned a lot about Batman's world, though the lack of bosses was disappointing. Oh well, future games can address that. The combat offers a fair challenge but leans toward the easier side. Leveling up Batman felt underwhelming. However, upgrading and acquiring gadgets throughout the campaign introduces fresh mechanics. Gaining access to previously unreachable areas creates a satisfying sense of progression."
121,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"'To the Moon' is no mere game... Nay, it is a veritable experience, and one of the best of my life at that. Think Telltale's *The Walking Dead* is sad? Hohoho! Well, it's no match for *To the Moon*! Never before have I been so moved yet fulfilled by something purely fictional. This masterpiece represents storytelling at its finest, and the soundtrack is a charming and perfect accompaniment. Yes, the controls are a bit finicky and the gameplay isn't the strong point, but the story is so compelling that I didn’t mind at all. Plus, the humor is delightful and never detracts from the narrative's depth... And the *Doctor Who* references are endless."
122,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Bastion is an outstanding game, featuring a captivating storyline. Set after a catastrophic event, you begin rebuilding the bastion. The game offers extensive choice, allowing you to decide what structures to build for an advantage, which weapons to wield, and which upgrades to apply—alongside selecting drinks for bonus effects. The art style and music are exceptional, with vibrant visuals proving the apocalypse need not be bleak. Best of all, the game features dynamic narration based on your actions. For instance, if you swap weapons in the armory, the narrator comments on your new choice."
123,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"I originally bought this game during early development, when the only currency was spacebux and there was no 'tech tree.' Back then, the game was great. All the guns were equally overpowered, so imbalance wasn't an issue—anyone could kill anyone at any time. Plus, the game offered unlimited gun slots and five loadouts. You'd think a game boasting 'bajillions of guns' would provide more than 6 weapon slots and 3 loadouts before charging for extras. At one point, I had around 3 pages of guns and was brainstorming new ideas because, for me, that was the fun part."
124,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"This game was a surprising gem. While rave reviews can often be misleading, in this case, they truly capture the fun of this neat little game. It blends a classic 2D platformer with a MOBA seamlessly and stylishly. I enjoyed characters I wouldn’t typically favor in other MOBAs. Though I expected this trend to continue, I tried a melee tank anyway—and was pleasantly surprised. I ended up exploring more as they unlocked through gameplay. The art style and interface are oddly charming. Now, I even use a character as my avatar and a wallpaper from creating a card set for the game."
125,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"I just started playing, but I love this game. I put on my headphones and lose myself in it for hours. It's been a while since a game has captivated me like this. The music sets the mood, the sound effects are spot-on, and the controls are flawless. I eagerly anticipate every battle, and combat is brilliantly optimized. I had doubts about the naval combat system, but it's exhilarating to decimate multiple fleets at once! The only way to lose is by failing to retreat. If combat seems overwhelming, just withdraw, regroup, and strike back. Thanks, devs, for an incredible experience!"
126,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"The reboot of the *Devil May Cry* franchise has introduced significant changes, particularly for the series’ protagonist, Dante. While longtime fans may lament the shift, it ultimately benefits the character; Ninja Theory’s new game proves this. *DmC* serves as an ideal entry point for newcomers, showcasing the origins of an arrogant, cynical Dante and tracing his evolution into selflessness. The game crafts a clear narrative arc for this new Dante, making him a compelling figure. The story follows him as he confronts the corrupt world he once ignored."
127,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Where do I begin with this absolutely beautiful game? Its story is utterly charming, packed with intricate details, and brimming with happiness, bad puns, annoying dogs, and secrets. It balances seriousness with humor effortlessly. The character design is impeccable, featuring diverse personalities and hidden depths. What sets it apart from other RPGs is the option to avoid killing anyone—a rare concept in the genre. Drawing heavy inspiration from *EarthBound*, one of the finest RPGs I’ve encountered, its quality is undeniable. Plus, it boasts the best soundtrack I’ve heard in years."
128,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"I recommend this solely because it's free and might offer a more enjoyable experience for others. As for me, the 'game' fell flat. Half the story relies on shock value, but I felt neither shocked nor moved. Perhaps I'm desensitized, or it was too simplistic to evoke a reaction. The other half attempts to depict mental decline, exploring obsession, hallucination, depression, and more. Theoretically, it's an interesting concept. However, the 'game' took me just 10 minutes to finish, even while carefully absorbing every detail."
130,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"If you can overlook the bugs (I personally encountered only two: one minor and another quite annoying) edit: both issues are resolved—one fix boosted my fps from 60-90 to 80-120—and are seeking a space exploration game, I highly recommend this. Since most reviews focus on specs, here are mine: i5 6600k (~200€), Radeon RX 480 (~200€), Z170 Pro-Gaming (~150€), 16GB DDR4 RAM (~70€). At ~650€, this setup falls in the mid-range, though admittedly, it's fairly new. Nearly constant 60+ fps on high settings with Vsync enabled. I’m baffled by 90% of comments claiming their overpowered rigs barely hit 20fps."
131,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Remember *Age of Mythology*? Yeah, it's been that long since we've seen an RTS game of such caliber. *Divinity: Dragon Commander* comes awfully close to being my personal favorite. Combine this with a grand strategy mode akin to *Risk*, and it truly hits the mark. I try not to be overly biased, but the fact that you can transform into a dragon—supporting troops, attacking, and even managing unit production—is incredible. Nowadays, I do enjoy complex RTS games like *Civ V*. However, such titles often cram intricate mechanics, charts, and resources into a single overwhelming experience."
132,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Undertale combines its elements to create something greater than the sum of its parts. The graphics are solid for a retro title, and the music is charming, but together they craft truly beautiful and impactful moments. The script ranges from comedic to dramatic to heartbreaking to hopeful, sometimes simultaneously, while subverting RPG tropes. And this is without even mentioning the world, characters, story, or gameplay... I could write pages about it. But instead, I'll just say this: if you like RPGs, play this game. If you enjoy video games, play this game. If you have seven free hours before your death, play this game."
134,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"I’ve only had this game for a few months, but in that short time, two DLCs have been released, along with patches that transformed an already great game into an excellent one. The devs are highly active in the community, evident in discussion forums and dev diaries. There’s a fairly steep learning curve to the mechanics, which I’m still mastering, but this strategic depth offers countless ways to achieve goals and exploit situations. The game feels almost infinitely replayable. I’m drawn into every session, no matter how the playthrough unfolds."
135,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Warframe is a fun game for the first few hours of play. After those initial enjoyable hours, you'll notice the only thing left is repetitive combat, enemies, and gameplay. The major highlight is the developers' dedication, with frequent updates that introduce sweeping system changes, new warframes, and other tweaks. It's a solid casual game, though unlikely to hold your attention beyond a few months unless you enjoy grinding. The best part is that it's free, so I'd recommend giving it a try. If you're looking for a quick fix, it's worth checking out."
136,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"This game is so... very... boring. I bought it because I believed it was a PC version of *Katamari Damacy*, a popular and enjoyable PS2 game. Sadly, it’s far from it. In this game, you go around absorbing increasingly larger objects to grow bigger. But the gameplay lacks smoothness, the levels are uninspired, and the overall experience feels like a surreal horror show—not an entertaining one, but one that leaves you depressed and questioning existence.

A simulator of the road to becoming president! That sounds fun!* Well, it really wasn't. The game starts by making you pick a side: Republican or Democrat—no independent or third-party option. A little disappointed but still optimistic, I carried on to see what I could do. I will give the game credit: the character customization, though limited, is pretty fun to experiment with. It's the only time you can choose whether to wear your head in a campaign. Literally."
138,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Fallout 3’s story was superior. Settlements disrupt the narrative, making you resent managing them instead of enjoying the plot. Some keys are hardcoded and unchangeable. Bugs are rampant—my Pip-Boy vanished permanently, forcing me to use console commands. Power armor requires no effort; it’s handed to you early, and cores are abundant, diminishing its value. The story is mediocre, as is most of the game, though it’s more stable than Fallout 3. Is it better than Fallout 3? No. New Vegas? No. This title was vastly overhyped for its lackluster quality."

""My stats (at the time of writing this review):  
- 8.6 hours to complete the game

What I liked:  
- Visuals were great until the final level (ice caves)  
- The story wasn’t outstanding, but the post-credits ending made the playthrough worthwhile  

What I disliked:  
- The last level’s visuals were dull  
- Gameplay became overly difficult, forcing repetitive retries  
- Achievements were excessively tough—only 2.1% of players unlocked 13 out of 15!"
140,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Pros:  
+ Great graphics  

Cons:  
- Bugs (especially in the environment; you may get stuck or shots may hit an invisible wall despite a clear line of sight)  
- Excessive handholding/babysitting  
- Dumb AI  
- Enemies always know your location once spotted  
- Frustrating godlike enemy accuracy, reminiscent of the first Ghost Warrior  
- Poor checkpoint and save system  
- Unengaging story that fails to captivate  

I wouldn’t recommend it unless it’s 90% off—even then, playing feels like a tedious chore. I’m only finishing it to move on to the next game in my library. Given how dull the first Ghost Warrior was (and how relieved I was to complete it), I likely won’t see this one through to the end."

For one thing, I have a Vive and prefer playing room-scale games with motion controllers. Beyond that, the game is initially awe-inspiring in its vast universe, but I also found that scale hindered my enjoyment. The steep learning curve and time required to do anything engaging early on were too much for me. Perhaps with more patience and gaming time, it would appeal to me. But I lack both, and there are many other VR games I'd rather play."
144,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Hands down my favorite first-person shooter of all time. Run-and-gun rambos need not apply. Recoil and ballistics are realistic. A single hit to the chest, neck, or head from rifle-caliber weapons is almost always fatal unless it barely grazes you. Rounds drop over distance, and short, controlled bursts are essential to stay on target. There is no magical ammunition pool. Reloading halfway through your magazine leaves you with a pouch full of partially spent mags. You can't sprint indefinitely—prolonged running impairs your aim as you gasp for breath. Rest your weapon on your elbows while prone or on a window sill to stabilize your aim. Accuracy suffers when standing."

Initially set to high, it ran sluggishly but remained playable. Dropping to medium smoothed it out.

Moreover, most existing detectors prioritize accuracy, which does not fully align with maintaining the trustworthiness of product evaluations. To address these challenges, we formulate a minimax game where spammers and detectors compete based on practical goals beyond mere detection accuracy.

Within this family, we identify a tracking solution with a single parameter to simultaneously control transfer fidelity, excited-state population, and robustness.

Specifically, each local minimum involves either fitting multiple Gaussians to one true component or fitting a single Gaussian to multiple true components. Our findings hold when the true mixture components meet a separation condition and remain valid even if the number of components is misspecified. For three-component Gaussian mixtures, we derive sharper results based on the separation scaling."

For $n$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-like states, the most robust witness requires $n+1$ local measurement settings and tolerates up to $1/2$ white noise.

These geometries can violate the axial and equatorial symmetry of the Kerr metric, exhibiting a far richer multipolar structure that offers a pathway to phenomenologically constrain fuzzball models. Our numerical analysis suggests that all multipole moments are generally larger (in absolute value) than those of a Kerr black hole with identical mass and spin. Current measurements of black-hole candidates' quadrupole moments impose only weak constraints on fuzzballs, whereas future gravitational-wave observations of extreme mass-ratio inspirals with LISA will enhance these bounds significantly."

To address these challenges, we propose a model combining temporal point processes and variational autoencoders that learns to infer temporal attention between nodes by observing their interactions. Since temporal attention governs feature propagation between nodes, leveraging interaction dynamics to learn this crucial component offers greater flexibility while avoiding the limitations of human-specified edges."

Using this template, we design a scalable supervisor whose state size and computational complexity remain unaffected by the number of agents, even under partial observation. The scalable supervisor requires no recomputation when agents are added or removed. We extend prior results to partial observation by establishing sufficient conditions for safety and maximal permissiveness of the least restrictive supervisor at the template level. An example demonstrates the proposed scalable supervisory synthesis."
231,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"Electric network frequency (ENF) fluctuations serve as a powerful tool in multimedia forensics. An efficient ENF estimation method is introduced using temporal windowing based on the filter-bank Capon spectral estimator. A Gohberg-Semencul factorization of the model covariance matrix is employed, leveraging its Toeplitz structure. Additionally, this approach introduces, for the first time in ENF analysis, a non-rectangular temporal window prior to spectral estimation. Krylov matrices enable fast matrix inversion. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in ENF estimation for 1-second power recordings. In speech recordings, it achieves high accuracy with low computational complexity."

The included methods fall into three categories: projection pursuit-based dimension reduction, sufficient dimension reduction, and robust M-estimators for dimension reduction. Additionally, regularized regression estimators based on these reduced-dimension spaces are provided, spanning from classical principal component regression to sparse partial robust M-regression. The package also offers classical and robust preprocessing utilities, such as generalized spatial signs, along with dedicated plotting and cross-validation tools. Designed to align with the scikit-learn API, **direpack** ensures seamless integration into statistical and machine learning pipelines within that framework."
233,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"The nonlinear fluorescence emission has been widely used for high spatial resolution optical imaging. Here, we investigated the fluorescence anomalous saturating effect in nitrogen vacancy defects in diamond. Fluorescence reduction was observed under high-power laser excitation, enhancing the nonlinearity of emission and altering the spatial frequency distribution of the image. We employed a differential excitation protocol to extract high spatial frequency information. By modulating the laser power, imaging resolution improved by approximately 1.6 times compared to confocal microscopy. Given the simplicity of the setup and data processing, we anticipate this method can enhance spatial resolution for sensing and biological labeling with solid-state defects."
234,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"When random effects are correlated with sample design variables, the standard approach of using individual survey weights (constructed as inverses of unit inclusion probabilities) to form a pseudo-likelihood fails to yield asymptotically unbiased inference. We propose a weight-exponentiated formulation for the random effects distribution that ensures unbiased inference for hyperparameters. Our method is compared with frequentist approaches relying on numerical integration, showing that only the Bayesian approach achieves both design-unbiased estimation and population consistency. Simulations and a business establishment survey demonstrate our method's versatility across models and sampling designs. This work culminates recent efforts integrating traditional survey estimation with Bayesian modeling, bridging two rich but distinct fields."
235,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"Low-symmetry 2D materials—such as ReS$_2$ and ReSe$_2$ monolayers, black phosphorus monolayers, group-IV monochalcogenide monolayers, and borophene—exhibit more complex atomistic structures than the honeycomb lattices of graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, and transition metal dichalcogenides. The reduced symmetries of these emerging materials lead to inhomogeneous electron, optical, valley, and spin responses, along with novel properties like ferroelasticity, ferroelectricity, magnetism, spin-wave phenomena, strong nonlinear optical effects, photogalvanic responses, and superconductivity. Unique electronic topological features, nonlinear elastic behaviors, and structural phase transitions can also arise due to low symmetry. The *Beyond Graphene: Low-Symmetry and Anisotropic 2D Materials* special topic highlights recent experimental and theoretical advances in these materials."
236,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"Orientational dynamics in the isotropic phase of a comb-shaped nematic polymer with mesogenic and functional side groups were investigated using Kerr effect and dielectric spectroscopy. For the first time, it was observed that in a mesogenic polymer, unlike low-molecular-weight mesogens, the relaxation of electric birefringence above the nematic-isotropic phase transition temperature can be described by a sum of multiple exponential processes, two of which dominate. These primary processes alternate within a temperature range of approximately fifty degrees. Dielectric spectroscopy also revealed two orientational relaxation processes: the first arises from rotation of the side mesogenic groups, while the second relates to motion of the main chain segments."
237,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"Deep hashing methods have demonstrated strong retrieval accuracy and efficiency in large-scale image retrieval. Optimizing discrete hash bits remains a key focus in these methods. A common strategy is to employ an activation function, such as $\operatorname{sigmoid}(\cdot)$ or $\operatorname{tanh}(\cdot)$, while minimizing a quantization loss to approximate discrete values. However, this approach may trap hash bits in the wrong saturated regions of activation functions without recovery. We term this issue the ""dead bits problem (dbp)."" Additionally, existing quantization losses exacerbate dbp. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective gradient amplifier applied before activation functions to mitigate dbp."

The stable case is constrained by LHC disappearing-track searches and dark matter direct detection, while the decaying case faces limits from multilepton collider searches. A two-step phase transition with a stable triplet and negative quadratic term is ruled out by direct detection, and an unstable triplet below $230\ \mathrm{GeV}$ is excluded at $95\%$ confidence."
239,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"This paper demonstrates that the eccentric debris rings around the stars Fomalhaut and HD 202628 are narrower than predicted by the standard eccentric planet perturbation model (often termed ""pericenter glow""). The conventional scenario assumes an initially circular, narrow belt of planetesimals at semi-major axis \(a\), whose eccentricity rises to \(e_f\) after gas disc dispersal due to secular perturbations from an eccentric planet, producing a belt of width \(2ae_f\). A slight modification allows narrower belts if planetesimals start with eccentricity, possibly induced by earlier planetary perturbations during the gas-rich protoplanetary phase. Alternatively, primordial eccentricity might arise from disc instabilities, eliminating the need for planets altogether."

In one dimension (1D), the physics of interacting electrons is well described at low energies by the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) model, yet little has been observed experimentally beyond this linear regime. Here, we present measurements of many-body modes in 1D gated wires using tunneling spectroscopy. We detect two distinct Fermi seas at high energies, linked to spin and charge excitations, along with the appearance of three additional 1D 'replica' modes that intensify as wire length decreases. The effective interaction strength in the wires is adjusted by varying 1D intersubband screening by over 45%."

Micromagnetic simulations of MSM and STNO responses to current pulses demonstrate that an RC system using a single MSM achieves outstanding performance in handwritten digit recognition. Moreover, a physical RC system comprising 24 STNOs effectively solves complex nonlinear dynamic problems, as confirmed in second-order nonlinear dynamic and NARMA10 tasks."

In this paper, we uncover a surprising consequence of popularity-based rankings: the fewer the items reporting a signal, the greater their collective share of traffic. This few-get-richer effect arises when items fall into limited distinct classes (e.g., left-leaning vs. right-leaning news sources) and are ranked by popularity. We analytically show this effect occurs when users click top-ranked items and exhibit heterogeneous class preferences. Through simulations, we examine how the effect’s strength varies with contextual and behavioral assumptions. We also experimentally validate our predictions in an online study. Our findings offer critical insights into misinformation spread."

However, most pruning techniques trade model accuracy for regularity, resulting in compromised inference accuracy and suboptimal on-device performance. To address this, we introduce pattern-based sparsity—a novel dimension combining pattern and connectivity sparsity—delivering high accuracy and hardware efficiency. With meticulously designed patterns, our pruning method consistently enhances accuracy and improves feature extraction across diverse DNN architectures and datasets. Additionally, our framework integrates pattern library extraction, selection, pruning, and weight training seamlessly. This approach naturally aligns with compiler optimizations, ensuring efficient DNN execution on mobile devices."

Roosevelt cherished the outdoors, but Muir had invited him for more than camping: Yosemite was imperiled. Though designated protected land in 1864, the valley still faced overdevelopment in 1903. It was central to a decades-long struggle to preserve land for both conservation and public use—two ideals far easier envisioned than achieved. The conflict over Yosemite began with the 1849 Gold Rush, as miners flocked west, scouring the Sierra Nevada foothills for gold."
281,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"Hello. This is my first trip—the first time in my life I've been outside the walls of Gaza. I'm so happy to be here. (Applause) My dream has always been to become a pilot, to fly a plane, to feel the freedom of soaring through the sky. But that never happened. Simply put, I live in Gaza, where there is no airport. All borders are closed on every side. We live in one of the world's largest prisons. The only thing I can do is gaze up at the sky. Some days, we're lucky to have electricity for four or five hours. When it's cold, we light a fire in front or on the roof of our homes."
282,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"I am sorry I cannot show you my face, because if I do, the bad guys will come for me. My journey began 14 years ago as a young reporter fresh out of college. I uncovered a scoop—a straightforward story about police officers taking bribes from street hawkers. Knowing this was common knowledge yet unchecked, I chose a unique approach for maximum impact. I posed as a seller to gather irrefutable evidence. The results were outstanding. This is what many call immersion or undercover journalism."
283,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"One simple vitamin can reduce your risk of heart disease. Eating chocolate lowers stress in students. A new drug extends lives of patients with a rare disease. Health headlines like these appear daily, often contradicting one another. There’s often a gap between sensational headlines and the nuanced findings of the actual research. How can you avoid being misled? The best approach is to examine the original study behind the claim. We’ve created hypothetical research scenarios for each of these headlines. Keep watching for the first example’s explanation; then pause to answer the question. These are simplified scenarios."
284,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"When I was 14, my family was in the process of adopting my little brothers from Ethiopia. One day, my mom asked, ""What day should we put for their birthday?"" ""Uh, the day they were born, obviously?"" I replied, thinking it was a ridiculous question. Then my mom explained, ""Well, Kristen, neither of your little brothers have a birth certificate, so how do you suggest we find out when that was?"" Mind blown. Now, 20 years later, I’m still working on it—except instead of solving the mystery of my brothers' missing birth certificates, I tackle this issue globally. So, what do birth certificates have to do with international development?"
285,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"Imagine if you could connect your mind to a machine offering endless pleasure for life. If given the choice to embrace such an existence, would you? That’s the question philosopher Robert Nozick explored through his thought experiment, the Experience Machine. The scenario challenges us to envision a world where scientists create a device simulating reality, ensuring only joy and no suffering. The catch? You must abandon reality permanently, though you’d scarcely notice. Your simulated experiences would feel indistinguishable from real life. Life’s natural highs and lows would simply fade into an unbroken stream of happiness. Sounds perfect, doesn’t it?"
286,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"I would like to share the most embarrassing moment from my years as a palliative care physician. This occurred a few years ago when I was consulted to see a woman in her 70s—a retired English professor with pancreatic cancer. She was experiencing pain, nausea, and vomiting. During our discussion about her symptoms, she asked if medical marijuana might help. I reflected on everything I had learned in medical school about it, which didn’t take long because I had learned nothing at all."
287,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"For the past 24 years, I have been a firefighter in Huntington, West Virginia. My team and I are tasked with saving lives and property from disasters like car wrecks, house fires, and life-threatening medical emergencies. As a woman leading a department in a male-dominated profession, I decided a decade ago to expand my medical expertise by earning a nursing degree. It became clear that the next major threat facing my city—and others nationwide—was not a one-time disaster where firefighters could swoop in, extinguish the flames, and leave feeling accomplished. Instead, it required deeper, sustained intervention."
288,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"Where does all the carbon we release go? Carbon follows a natural cycle, present in all living things: in the soil, oceans, atmosphere, and rocks deep underground. When plants and organisms die, much of their stored carbon returns to the atmosphere until new plants absorb it again. Over millions of years, some carbon from ancient trees and sea life forms rock or fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas. Natural events, such as volcanic eruptions, release trapped carbon. Human activities, like burning fossil fuels, also release prehistoric carbon. Today, humans emit around 60 times more carbon than all volcanoes combined annually."
289,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"Even nature's most repulsive creatures hold vital secrets, but who would welcome a swarm of cockroaches approaching them? Yet one of the starkest contrasts between natural and human technologies lies in robustness. Robust systems remain stable in complex and unfamiliar environments. Astonishingly, cockroaches can self-stabilize while traversing rough terrain. When equipped with a jet pack or subjected to disruptions like an earthquake, their exquisitely adapted legs enable them to self-correct without cognitive input. They navigate challenging landscapes like grass effortlessly, maintaining stability. We observed a novel behavior where their body shape causes them to automatically roll sideways to maneuver through artificial grass obstacles. Robust systems can execute diverse functions with identical structures—this is our groundbreaking discovery."
290,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"These are grim economic times, fellow trendsters—grim indeed. To lift your spirits, let me share one of the great, albeit lesser-known, commercial success stories of the past two decades. In its own peculiar way, it rivals the achievements of Microsoft or Google. This industry has weathered the current recession with remarkable resilience. I’m referring to organized crime. Now, you might argue that organized crime is nothing new—and you’d be right. But over the last 20 years, it has expanded unprecedentedly, now accounting for roughly 15% of global GDP. I call it the global shadow economy, or McMafia, for short. So, what fueled this extraordinary growth in cross-border crime?"
291,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"If you ask people which aspect of psychology they find most challenging and mention thinking and emotions, most will respond, ""Emotions are terribly difficult. They're incredibly complex—I have no idea how they work. But thinking seems straightforward: just logical reasoning or something. That's not the hard part."" Here’s a list of problems that arise. One interesting issue is health. The other day, I read that handshaking in the West might be the leading cause of disease."
292,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"What is a parent? It’s not an easy question. Today, we have adoption, stepfamilies, and surrogate mothers. Many parents face difficult questions and decisions. Should we tell our child about the sperm donation? If so, when? What words should we use? Sperm donors are often called ""biological fathers,"" but is ""father"" the right term? As a philosopher and social scientist, I’ve studied these questions about parenthood. Today, I’ll share insights from conversations with parents and children. I’ll show you that they understand what truly matters in a family, even if their family looks different."
293,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"When I look in the mirror today, I see a justice and education scholar at Columbia University, a youth mentor, an activist, and a future New York State senator. (cheering) I see all of that and a man who spent a quarter of his life in prison—six years, to be exact, starting as a teenager on Rikers Island for an act that nearly cost a man his life. But what brought me from there to here wasn’t the punishment I faced as a teenager in adult prison or the harshness of our legal system. Instead, it was the transformative power of education—a classroom environment that introduced me to possibilities I never imagined for myself or our justice system. A few weeks before my parole release, a counselor encouraged me to enroll in a new college course offered in prison."
294,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"What do you think when you look at me? A woman of faith? An expert? Maybe even a sister. Or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist. Or just an airport security line delay. That one's actually true. (Laughter) If some of your perceptions were negative, I don't blame you. That's how the media portrays people like me. One study found 80% of news coverage about Islam and Muslims is negative. And studies show most Americans don't know a Muslim. I guess people don't talk to their Uber drivers. (Laughter) Well, for those who've never met a Muslim, it's great to meet you."
295,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"We need to build a weather service for water. Yet, until we collectively demand accountability, the incentives to fund it will not exist. The first time I spoke at a conference was here at TED, eight years ago. Fresh out of grad school, I had no idea that in those few minutes onstage, I was shaping the questions I’d face for the next decade. And, like many 20-somethings, I expected to solve the world's problems—especially its water challenges—with my technology. I had much to learn. It was tempting to believe our biggest water quality issues persist because they’re difficult to detect. I assumed we just needed simpler, faster, and cheaper sensors. I was wrong."
296,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"Indeed, for 20 years, I worked in finance. I knew everything about it, undoubtedly. The global economy was my life. Any topic you could raise—ecology, the end of the world—I dismissed, though I understood them well. In 2007, an extraordinary event occurred: the subprime crisis, the collapse of major American banks. It was a shock. I had heated discussions with my wife about my job and the flaws in the system. Beyond the crisis, I realized I was entirely mistaken—we were headed for disaster."
297,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"So, I'll be speaking to you using language... simply because I can. This is one of those magical abilities we humans possess. We can transmit highly complex thoughts to one another. Right now, I'm making sounds with my mouth as I exhale—tones, hisses, and puffs—creating air vibrations. These vibrations travel to you, striking your eardrums, and your brain transforms them into thoughts. I hope. (laughter) I hope that's happening. Because of this ability, we humans can share ideas across vast distances and time. We can transmit knowledge between minds."

It’s 1988, and scientist James Hansen has just testified to the United States Congress that global warming trends are caused by human activity and will pose an increasing threat to humanity. Well, well. That’s unusually prescient for a human. Looking for a wedding dress? Try a fresh take on a timeless classic—sleek, flattering, and modest, just like traditional styles. Commercials. Could anything be more insufferable? It’s 1997, and the U.S. Senate has convened a hearing on global warming. Expert witnesses note that past periods in Earth’s history were warmer than the 20th century."
300,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"Someone once said that politics is, of course, ""showbiz for ugly people."" So, on that note, I feel I’ve truly arrived. Another point to consider is what an honor it is, as a politician, to deliver a TED Talk, especially here in the U.K., where politics' reputation, after the expenses scandal, has plummeted. There was even a recent story about scientists considering replacing rats in experiments with politicians. When asked why, they replied, ""Well, there’s no shortage of politicians, few care what happens to them, and, after all, there are some things rats simply won’t do."" (Laughter) Now, since you all love data, I’ll begin with a data-rich slide."
