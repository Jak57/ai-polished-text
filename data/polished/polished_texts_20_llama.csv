1,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Another week flew by me. I drove by the new house yesterday and the front window was covered in boxes. We may get the keys at closing, I'm getting so excited. If all goes well this week, we will be set for closing a week from Wednesday. I was up until after 3 00 am last night watching movies with Bethany. There has been a lot of movie watching going on around here lately. Here's my rundown; last night we watched thirteen, a movie every mother of a teen should see. It was better than I expected. Then we watched Gigli, yeah it was just as bad as the media said it was, but we had to see for ourselves."
2,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Summer television used to be a barren landscape of reruns and mediocrity. However, two new shows have recently caught my attention, and I've been devoted to them for the past week. A peculiar concept has piqued my interest: hairstylist Jonathan Antin aims to establish a second location of his highly successful West Hollywood salon in Beverly Hills. Initially, I wouldn't have given it a second thought, but while channel-surfing, I stumbled upon Jonathan, equally self-absorbed and unremarkable, gazing at an empty space on Rodeo Drive, boasting (in a public voice) ""I will build here the greatest salon in the history of the world!"" and I was hooked. Not since Rocco have I found a character so cringe-worthy yet captivating to watch."
3,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"What a week ago, my right shoulder has been afflicted with tendonitis. It's located under my shoulder blade, so when I move my arm too much, mainly when using a mouse on a computer, it kills me. I can barely muster the strength to draw anything. The lack of sleep adds to my pain. I'm not too happy right now, but I'll get better."
4,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Kindness of strangers is a remarkable quality that can quickly turn the simplest tasks into a daunting ordeal. I learned today, while attempting to do laundry with the kids, how sweet total strangers can be, without any expectation of reward or recognition. It wasn't as if they were trying to gain something from me; they simply wanted to be kind. I had a kid spit up on me and was wearing my ""wash-day"" outfit, which made things more challenging. I'm not sure I'll ever be bathing again, so there was no real incentive to do so. Right now, I'm doing two things simultaneously  composing a post and watching a video. I'm accomplishing both tasks at my desk in my room."
5,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"It's 11 14 PM MST, and I'm sitting in my bedroom, fixing the personal computer of my job's personnel director. While I don't mind doing it, I sometimes wonder at how often I find myself fixing someone else's computer as a favor. I'm grateful to be able to love and serve people this way, but where is the line drawn where it becomes too much and you're being taken advantage of? The past couple of weeks, I've been staying up late reading and such, so I was looking forward to hitting the sack early, until I realized it would be more practical to get this computer out of my bedroom and back into its owner's hands. *laughs* No rest for the weary, right? So, I found myself watching Joe Schmo 2 again tonight."
6,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Remind me, what did I write about before this? Or, a continuation in the 'is this a date?' saga, so after the weird lunch, my confidence shook, I forgot to tell you guys an important piece of the story. Before Pat shows up to lunch, Dusty starts talking about what a nice guy Pat is and how he's trying to find a girlfriend for him. I'm listening and nodding, realizing that we're talking more about finding Dusty's best friend a girl, than discussing whatever it is you discuss with a stranger over pink lemonade. I excused myself to the bathroom, looked in the mirror, and silently asked myself  Am I being pawned off to the other guy? Is this what happens now?"
7,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"I would like everyone to think before they act. In fact, I'd like each and every person in the world to make a conscious effort to think before they start their day, and commit to maintaining that mindfulness throughout. If they're not prepared to do so, I'd like it if they'd consider taking a moment to reflect and recharge. I'm tired of being frustrated by people's lack of thoughtfulness. Not that I'm the most intelligent person in the world, but I believe it's fair to call out those who consistently make thoughtless decisions. Let's focus on a few specific types of individuals today, and save some for another time, sound good?"
8,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Two issues with the scenario outlined in my previous post  1. While the Bush administration's economic stimulus is stimulating the economy, it is doing so in the wrong way. According to Robert Rubin, who told NPR's Marketplace today, the same stimulus effect could have been achieved without the long-term debt burden by enacting different tax cuts, temporary tax cuts that would benefit low- and middle-income individuals. Ah, Robert Rubin. The sound of his name is music to our ears. Quickly  name one Bush administration cabinet official with Rubin's gravitas. Still thinking? It'll come to you... 2. We cannot give the Republicans control only in wartime because they've cleverly concocted an endless, global ""war on terrorism."""

Tonight, I beat Andy by a few small dollars and won the Farqu game, or maybe I let him win because he left in a few short hours and I wanted him to feel good on his last night here. Well, however the story goes, it can't compare to this Texas-sized headache I have at the moment. I've taken some Aleve, and I must say that they are doing the trick; all I need now is some well-deserved rest and relaxation."
12,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Well, today has been a long day. We drove home from Indiana. I suppose I'll be selective about what I write about, as I could take up a considerable amount of time and space, and I'm just not feeling energetic enough. First, I have to say that camp was amazing and even better than I could have expected. God has been doing so much in my life lately, and it's just incredible. I've sort of turned over a new leaf, but I'm back to the beginning. We arrived at the Twiggs' house on Friday evening and stayed until we left for camp on Monday. Most of what we did was visit the fair, attend church, watch a parade, go to Walmart, and watch movies."

While I'm not thrilled about it, I'd rather get it over with than reschedule it during my busy first month of surgery rotation. I'm feeling nervous, anxious, and apprehensive about this new experience. As a perfectionist, I strive to excel in everything I do, but starting something new can be daunting. I dislike feeling like a pawn, unsure of what to expect."
14,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Arun Shourie discusses how, in 1996, the then Governor of Uttar Pradesh warned about the impending threat of a ""third Islamic state"" rising in the subcontinent. T.V. Rajeswar, the former Intelligence Bureau chief and current Uttar Pradesh Governor, had previously predicted this dire threat in a series of Hindustan Times articles. Shourie raises a pertinent question: does the fact that T.V. Rajeswar, not he or Mr. Advani, wrote these warnings make them more credible? Or do you conclude that Rajeswar's consistent warnings render him a closet communalist, unfit to continue as Uttar Pradesh Governor?"
15,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Attitude  indifferent, looking forward to tonight, it's been a long and challenging day here today, folks, with almost no time to write anything for you readers. However, it's good to see Tigger taking up the reins herself and making an appearance, discussing things. Not much to say about yesterday, but I did attend a lovely performance of Shakespeare on the green, although I had to leave before the curtain closed, which was a bit disappointing. I hope to see the entire production someday. Meanwhile, I digress. Akcron is right about the problems with the shower, it's quite frustrating, in terms of laughing at oneself in the shower, you have to admit, the look people get when self-torturing can be quite entertaining."
16,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"All of a sudden, for the past two days, I have been overcome with extreme fatigue. Bone-deep exhaustion. Last evening, I went home, and just slept off, and only got up when my mother called me around 8 30. And when I woke up, it was all dark, and I hadn't switched the lights on, so I couldn't figure out what time or date it was, for a few seconds, it was just my mother's voice in the darkness and me grappling with reality. Wondering why I'm feeling so drained... Nice weather this morning. It was drizzling when I came. Although in Kolkata I hear it's been raining for the past three days."
17,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Last night was the worst. I threw away the sweater I was knitting, having only about 14 inches completed. I lost around $10 worth of yarn, as each skein costs $8. However, it had too many stitches by the time I reached the armholes and the mohair was knotting itself together as I knitted, so frogging didn't work well. The yarn broke a lot. I didn't even swear, which is unusual for me. I simply ripped and listened to the second season of Sex and the City (a great way to pass the time, library!). And then I got tired of it and threw it away. I suppose I could say I learned a lot while trying to complete this sweater."

And while giggling is good, one wonders if we would have found ourselves up that fire escape drinking beer in the fierce wind had we not been eating them earlier. Finding ourselves in a doorway to a bar sadly closed for business, we stopped to examine an office-supplies catalogue that had arrived in the post. Lucky we did.

Senate Republicans, hands up - who watched the 39-hour judicial nominations charade last week? I know I didn't. Well, okay - I did tune in once or twice. The entire colossal waste of time was perpetrated by Republicans who, peeved off that Democrats wouldn't roll over and nominate four of Bush's ideologically extreme justices, were trying to score political points by holding a multi-day spectacle. Never mind the fact that the Democrats have already approved 168 of Bush's judicial nominees - no, that's not good enough for the power-hungry Republicans who are for some reason laboring under the misapprehension they have a huge mandate for this kind of grandstanding."
21,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"This was a satisfying weekend. I spent a significant amount of time engaging in outdoor activities, after a prolonged period, I indulged in a lot of music (something I should have started doing earlier) and read a lot. I completed three books over the weekend - Bruce Sterling's Heavy Weather, Larry Niven's World of Ptavvs, and Octavia Butler's Parable of the Sower. Heavy Weather was a captivating cyberpunk adventure through a near-future USA, ravaged by global warming and general anarchy. While it was clever, well-paced, and altogether very convincing, I must confess that I failed to derive any profound insights from the story or characters. Not that both aren't well-crafted and vividly etched - it's a good book, but not an outstanding one, I suppose."
22,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"Coz, this is the aftermath of the first week back from practicum, which was a struggle, but it's only in the second week that the smoke has really started to clear. Post-practicum trauma was a hidden epidemic that is only now coming to light. I was struck, but with the eventual meeting with the course coordinator allowed me to release my burden, and by doing so, I have prevented another person from being stuck with such a pedagogically deficient practicum school. Yesterday, I bumped into another agrieved classmate who was quite determined to go to the student who was due to go to her school in the next practicum and tell him how terrible it will be. I calmed her down and suggested that we should go to the administrator first."

I am not a math person; I hate math and am math phobic. You get the picture. As I struggled to make sense of algebra, the doorbell rang. I put down my book and went to open the door. No one was there. Great. I returned to my studies and, just as I was finding a little glimmer of understanding, the doorbell rang again. Just what a struggling math student needs, an uninvited practical joke."
25,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"This past week has been nothing short of exhausting. I spent Tuesday to Thursday finishing the move to my new classroom. The new room is bigger and closer to my grade-level team, which are the things I need to consider as I spend hours upon hours preparing my room for this year. Had I known I was going to move prior to the end of my school year, I would have discarded much of the books and supplies I no longer use. Unfortunately, it all came with me. So this week was spent moving, unpacking, and purging profusely. I have to thank my teammate, Jill, for helping with all of this. You see, she was still teaching this month, in my old room, so she and her lovely students moved almost my entire room for me!"

Even if I never carried you as a child, even if I was never married to you, even if I was never an official partner to you... I loved you immensely, and to this day the feeling carries an echo through my heart. Forever will I always be reminded of the very few nights we spent together, hearts and limbs entwined in a soul-embrace, drenched in the salty darkness of an evening by the beach... Or a kiss under the rain. Whenever I get the feeling of a dark glass piercing my heart, you will be there. That piece of you... Bleeding the eternal love that once lived in me... And still remains."
27,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,blog,"I'm uncomfortable with investigative reporting, as it doesn't sit well with me. The article I'm working on and its consequences aren't exactly what I'm comfortable with. Perhaps it's because I don't fully believe in it, so I can't fully immerse myself in it. The angst behind it, the full-out passion towards it to question. I've grown up in a country where you don't ask questions, really, you just don't. They'll shoot you for that. They'll put you in jail with all these internal security acts. I'm not used to this freedom of speech; not used to questioning out loud."

The 30-minute walk was invigorating, and we were all catching our breath by the time we arrived. Whew! We braved the chilly ice-cold water, which made our bodies numb. We stayed for less than an hour before heading to the nearby waterfalls, another 30-minute trek. However, the trip was well worth it, as the falls were calming, and the scenery was breathtaking. It was as if we could hear ourselves harmonizing with nature. Soaking in the cold water was a meditative experience, like communing with Mother Earth. The cold air and water lulled us into a state of tranquility, almost sleep."

There are few instances I don't mind drinking, but let's just say they are very rare occasions. So, we have a month left before Ed leaves. I think it's starting to sink in with Ed and with all of us.

Sunday morning, when he woke up, he was so excited that the Easter bunny had come. There's nothing better than seeing the excitement on your child's face. After egg hunting, we all went to church.

The character development was rather weak. Additionally, I thought the score was poor, and was basically a knock-off of the Gladiator. The Gladiator used the background music of a moaning woman and it worked because it backed up and complemented a genuinely gripping narrative."

What I am finding is that in the old days when we asked for resolutions evidencing the authority to enter into the master agreement/derivative transactions, frequently the resolutions do not allow the counterparties to enter into currency transactions. Since transacting these currency transactions with our energy customers is a new area of business for us, I just wanted us all to be mindful to check these old resolutions and not to rely solely on the ""restrictions"" contained in the Lotus notes."

103,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"While not perfect, this game has been greatly enjoyable. The save system and possibility of sudden death lead to some frustration. I'm on my first playthrough, and I lost my main character around hour 10 of 20 hours. I would have really liked a save option to reload at that point. I've since picked up a third-party mod/save tool to avoid catastrophic failures. Additionally, the aiming reticule is on the small side, and the zoom is underpowered. With all that said, it's been a blast. I'm not normally a zombie fan, but the combination of strategy, missions, first-person shooter/beat 'em up is great. I've been playing it as often as I can get away... Just one more mission, just one more supply run - or I'm running away and want to get safe before shutting the game down."

The number of units is great. Not sure exactly how many units there are, but there's a crap ton! Graphics are just beautiful, sounds are great, and the gameplay overall is epic. The in-game chat box at the main menu is very entertaining as well, no, I am not kidding. However, if anyone thinks this game is 'easy', or if you are new to the strategy genre, it could take you quite some time to get it nailed down. Don't get upset, you will lose a lot of units. Just make sure you plan ahead, always have anti-air, and anti-tank."

It's not overly cheesy (okay, it's sometimes cheesy). And the diverse story characters have their own sense of humor. Those different characters really have distinct personalities. And the level design; it's just rad."
107,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"Yes, this is a nostalgia trip for thirty-somethings who remember, at least in the UK, watching the ever-irritating Transformers cartoon. The voice actors for Optimus, Megatron, Bumblebee, and many others are back, instantly recognizable. The distinctive cartoon transformation sound effects are there. Graphically, the cell-shaded presentation is perfect, and very Generation One. But aside from that, it's actually a very fun game. The combat mechanics are extremely well-done. Transforming mid-fight is often a necessity, and seamlessly woven into combos, making it quite unlike High Moon's excellent War for/Eon games. Another distinction is the heavy focus on melee combat, but some enemies, such as Seekers, require a switch to a ranged blaster."
108,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"So, I downloaded the game and played it for a little while, and it was nothing remarkable. I spent more time attempting to log in than actually playing the game. There is a bug where it claims an update to the terms of service or whatever is available, and whenever you click 'accept', it would simply pop up again. You have to restart the client for it to work. Although not excessively bothersome, I find it frustrating that I'm required to link my Steam and Gface accounts. They claim it's for DLC, but I fail to see the necessity. It's also non-reversible, so now I know that a company I don't care about has access to my Steam information. As for the game itself, it's underwhelming. It's easily recognizable as a CoD clone, except somehow they managed to make the gunplay worse... How is that even possible?"

In my opinion, this is a really great and fun game in truth, although the format may be somewhat annoying (where the free-roam city area repopulates with new enemies every time you progress the story). I particularly enjoyed the 'dual play' segments, where you can play Batman and Robin simultaneously, and the ability to use the controller for most segments of the game, but the mouse and keyboard for the tank combat segments was greatly appreciated. Driving your Batmobile around the free-roam city, including when chasing the APC commanders, is actually quite enjoyable once you figure out how to use the brakes to sidestep around corners (and when you master that, driving around the city is really quite enjoyable!)."

It's looks, sounds, and plays great - great FPS mechanics, nice story, cool characters, flawless voice acting, and a badass soundtrack. Not for the faint-hearted though - some of those cutscenes were pretty darn cruel and vivid. But when a game overall is so great, it's easier to spot the flaws, and here they are as I saw 'em  no sli support - what the heck? I had to put the game away until I upgraded my card, as it ran too poorly on my old dual GPU GTX 590. Make sure you have a fairly decent single GPU card. Stupidly small obstacles are often unclimbable."

I will break down this review into a few categories  graphics, controls, sound, and replayability. Graphics  the game has been set in a comic-like style. The graphics are very slick, with nice color schemes. They work well for this game. The graphics can be set on 'high' without stressing your system. I run this game on an i5 Pentium processor, with an NVIDIA GeForce 710M card and 8GB of memory, and it runs like clockwork (Windows 8.1). Controls  the game can be played with a keyboard and mouse, but also with an Xbox controller."

This is exactly what I wished for from a search game from Cod would be. But don't buy this game thinking it's like Cod, Battlefield, or any other shooter game. It's a game in its own class and should be treated as such. I've heard countless times new players complain about getting killed really fast. Oh, God forbid you get shot in the face and die. It's not like that happens in real life or anything. I've been playing this game for a while now, throwing all kinds of money at it. One of the best multiplayer games around. A good thing to play when you're not feeling CS GO."

The gameplay is solid, the art design is beautiful, the music is surprisingly high-quality and fitting, the story/world has me interested, and the puzzles are fun. But the best thing about this game beyond all that is the comedy. If you've played any RPGs since the dawn of video game RPGs, you'll laugh at the various jokes, parodies, and references; if you've never played an RPG before, you should still enjoy the game for its humor. If you played Final Fantasy VII or X, you absolutely need to play this game, without giving too much away... I had to actually stop playing after two hours to give my cheeks a break from laughing and smiling so much. What a delight so far."

The description sounded right up my alley, but the execution has done nothing for me. I love puzzle and exploration games, but I found this game to be completely unintuitive, and even after looking up how to progress, I still just simply didn't find the gameplay itself fun. It also completely lacks a pause button, or if it does have one, I never found it. Considering that a lot of sequences in the game are timed, this seems like a critical oversight."

The story wasn't just a story, but it felt like I was that person, trying to figure out what came next in the story that my character was telling. Gameplay was excellent and I learned a lot about myself through this game, mainly my fear of heights, which I never had a problem with until the ice caverns. My gut churned the whole time, but I kept going for Uncle Fred! If you guys made a DLC or second game, I would be the first to buy it and recommend it to everyone I know. Thanks to everyone involved in making this, you made an absolutely beautiful game."

In previous games, you were set on the Earth's timeline, going through periods like the Stone Age, Medieval Age, and Modern Age. However, in this game, you're set in the future on a mission to colonize a new planet. What I enjoy about this game is that it took a new approach and added some new mechanics, such as the affinity system and orbital layer. What I didn't enjoy was that with these new mechanics, the game could be overwhelming at times. What could be improved is incorporating some new artwork, like the environment you experience when communicating with another leader."

After playing 60+ hours, I can honestly say this is one of the better, more realistic zombie games. It's very much designed like a survival horror, as you must save up your ammo, heal your own wounds when you bleed out, take pills when you're infected, etc. Zombies feel very natural to be well animated for a free-to-play game. I recommend getting 1 or 2 friends to play with, but the community is super friendly, and you can usually make friends/talk with people in the chat or over voice comms."

Unfortunately, it lacks Aussie servers, which puts you at a severe disadvantage and creates unbearable lag. I played through the offline training mode, and it was stuttering and lagging as well, which is unacceptable. Couple that with the poor ping, and it just ruins the game. Everything feels like a mess - the menus, backgrounds, training, and in-game. I've never had this happen before with this card and thought it might not like my OC."
120,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"Very late last night I finished this. The story is not very deep or interesting, but what makes it stand out is the storytelling. The atmosphere is filled to the brim and the many collectibles do a great job at fleshing it out. I learned a lot about the world of Batman, so it was a little disappointing that so few bosses were in the game. Oh well, there's enough future games to rectify that. The combat is the right amount of challenge, but it's more on the easy side. Leveling up Batman wasn't very satisfying. It's the gadgets you upgrade and acquire during the campaign, which add nice new gameplay mechanics. Getting access to previously unreachable places makes for a nice sense of progression."

Think Telltale's the Walking Dead is sad? Hohoho! Well, it's no match for ""to the moon!"" Never before have I been so depressed yet fulfilled over something purely fictional. This masterpiece represents the pinnacle of storytelling in my opinion, and the soundtrack is a gorgeously charming and perfect accompaniment. Yes, the controls are a bit finicky and the gameplay is not the strong point, but the story is so fantastic that I did not care one bit. Plus, the humor is great, and it definitely does not intrude upon the distinguished nature of the story... And the references are endless."

There's a lot of choice in the game, with options for building, choosing weapons, and acquiring power-ups, as well as drinks for bonus effects. The art style and music are fantastic, making the game visually appealing. The game's narrative is based on your actions, so if you pick up a weapon and switch it for another in the armory, the narrative will reflect your change."
123,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"I initially acquired this game during its early development, when the primary currency was spacebux, and there was no tech tree. At that time, the game was enjoyable. All guns were equally overpowered, so there were no balance issues; anyone could eliminate anyone at any moment. Additionally, the game used to provide unlimited gun slots and five loadouts. One might assume that for a game with billions of guns, they would at least provide more than six weapon slots and three loadouts before requiring payment for further access. At one point, I had about three pages worth of guns and was planning on new ideas for more, as personally, that's where I found it enjoyable."
124,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"This game was a delightful discovery. One often sees rave reviews of certain products that are often misleading. In this case, the reviews reflect the fun of this charming little game. It is an innovative blend between a classic 2D platformer and an MOBA, and it does it with flair. I found myself enjoying characters that I wouldn't typically enjoy in other MOBA games. I had expected this trait to continue, but decided to give a melee tank a try anyway. I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome and ended up trying out more as they were unlocked from playing games. The art style and interface is quaintly charming. As such, I now use one of the characters as my avatar and a wallpaper from creating a card set for the game."

It's been a while since a game has had such a profound impact on me. The music sets the mood, the sound effects are spot-on, and the controls are flawless. I eagerly anticipate every combat, and they've optimized combat extremely well. I had my reservations about the naval combat system, but it is so much fun to lay waste to multiple fleets at a time! The only way to lose in this game is to fail to retreat. If the combat appears overwhelming, just get out of there, regroup, and counter-assault. Thank you, developers, for an exceptional experience!"

While fans of the original series may be upset at the change to their beloved character, it's certainly for the better; and this new game by Ninja Theory proves it. The game serves as the perfect point for newcomers to jump into the series. It shows the origins of an arrogant, cynical Dante, and it chronicles his journey from cynicism to selflessness. Throughout, the game weaves a clear, narrative arc for the new Dante, making him a compelling character to watch. The story follows Dante as he's introduced into the corrupt world he willfully chose to ignore."

It has so much detail put into it, and it is a bundle of happiness, bad puns, and annoying dogs, secrets. The character design is on point, with various characters having various personalities and secrets. It stands out from other RPGs because you don't have to kill anyone, which is an unused concept in RPGs."
128,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"I recommend this game solely because it's free and might be a more enjoyable experience for others. As for my experience, the game did nothing for me. Half the story relies on shock value. I wasn't shocked nor emotionally moved in any way by this. Maybe I'm desensitized, or maybe it was too simple to warrant a reaction out of me. As for the other half of the game, it attempts to paint a picture of a person in mental decline. It handles obsession, hallucinations, depression, and a few other things. In theory, it's a cool idea. But the game took me 10 minutes to complete, and that's with reading and taking in every little bit of information I could."

It's an amazing way to challenge your mind while still being entertaining. Although this game isn't as story-driven, it gave birth to one of the most popular games of 2011. I still play this game and return to it when I'm feeling bored, and I love to come back and see what gave birth to a legend and what's a legend. The gameplay is quite simple, to explain at least. You use portals to your advantage, along with buttons that activate a part of the puzzle. Two buttons are in the game, one that you press and one that you need a cube to put on."
130,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"If you can overlook the bugs (which I personally only had two  one minor and the other quite annoying), I can definitely recommend this game. The bugs are now resolved, and the fix increased my FPS from 60-90 to 80-120. Since most of these reviews are about specs, I'll include mine  i5 6600k, Radeon RX 480 (~200€) Z170 Pro - Gaming (~150€) 16GB DDR4 RAM (~70€) ~650€ is definitely within the medium price range, though, granted, this rig is quite new.

131,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,game_review,"Remember age of mythology? Yeah, it's been quite a while since there's been an RTS game of such quality. Divinity  Dragon Commander reaches awfully close to these borders of my most favorite RTS game. Combine this with a huge risk-like grand strategy mode and there, it hits the spot. I am not overly biased due to the fact that this game allows you to turn into a dragon, aiding your troops by supporting, attacking and even commanding unit production, direction and spawning at the very same time. Honestly, I do like the complex RTS games nowadays. Think of Civ V and so on. However, such games attempt to cram complex mechanics, charts and resources all into one complicated game mode."

After those hours, you'll begin to see that the game's primary offering is repetition in its combat, enemies, and game play. The notable highlight is the developers' dedication to frequent updates, which generally include sweeping changes, new Warframes, and other tweaks/features. It's a good game for casual play. However, I doubt it will captivate you beyond a few months unless you're deeply invested in grinding. The upside is that the game is free, so I recommend trying it out. If you're seeking a quick fix, it's worth a try."

Unfortunately, it's far from it. In this game, you progress by absorbing increasingly larger objects to grow bigger and consume bigger objects. However, the gameplay isn't as refined as it could be, the levels lack inventiveness, and the content is a surreal horror experience. I don't mean an entertaining horror experience, but one that makes you question whether being alive is all it should be. Every 'living' creature in this game, from small pets to human beings, makes me wonder if the creators of this game had an interest in taxidermy."

I thought, ""Oh wow! A simulator of the road to becoming president! That sounds fun!"" Well, it really wasn't. The game starts you off and says you need to pick a side  Republican or Democrat, there is no independent or third party. A little disappointed, but still optimistic, I carried on to see what I could do. I'll give the game credit, the character customization, although limited, is pretty fun to mess around with.

Some keys are hard-coded and cannot be rebound. Bugs galore. My Pip-Boy disappeared permanently at one point, and I had to research console commands to get it back. You don't have to work for power armor; it's basically given to you from the beginning of the game, and power cores are readily available in trader shops. The value of power armor has diminished greatly from previous Fallout games. The story is mediocre, with everything about this game being mediocre except that it doesn't crash every 10 minutes like Fallout 3. It's very stable compared to Fallout 3.

Single hits to the chest, neck, or head from rifle-caliber weapons almost always result in death unless it just grazes you. Rounds drop over distance and short, controlled bursts are required if you wish to remain on target. There is no magical ammunition pool. If you reload halfway through your magazine, all the time, then you'll have a pouch full of half-full mags. You can't run forever. If you sprint for a while, your aim will suffer as you gasp heavily until you have caught your breath. Rest your weapon on your elbows while prone or on a window sill to steady your aim. Accuracy suffers when standing."

However, subpar AI teammates and limited equipment types can be frustrating. The leveling system lacks branching, but the game is still enjoyable. It starts off quickly and maintains a good pace. Despite the limited equipment variety, it feels like there's always another ship to unlock or skill to level up. The game's replay value is greatly increased by the mods.

To ensure high fidelity, we employ the Lewis-Riesenfeld (L-R) method to derive a family of solutions, leading to an exact transfer, where the solutions follow a single dynamical mode of the L-R invariant. Among this family, we identify a tracking solution with a single parameter to control simultaneously the fidelity of the transfer, the population of the excited state, and robustness. We define a measure of the robustness of an uh-fidelity transfer as the minimum percentile deviation on the pulse areas at which the infidelity rises above 10^-4. The robustness of our shaped pulses is found superior to that of Gaussian and adiabatically-optimized pulses for moderate pulse areas."

We demonstrate that all local minima share the same form of structure that partially identifies the component centers of the true mixture, in the sense that each local minimum involves a non-overlapping combination of fitting multiple Gaussian distributions to a single true component and fitting a single Gaussian distribution to multiple true components. Our results apply to the setting where the true mixture components satisfy a certain separation condition, and are valid even when the number of components is over- or under-specified. For Gaussian mixtures with three components, we obtain sharper results in terms of the scaling with the separation between the components."

Due to the exponentially increasing Hilbert-space dimension with respect to the system size, it is very challenging to construct an efficient entanglement witness for general multipartite entangled states. For $n$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-like states, the most robust witness scheme requires $n+1$ local measurement settings and can tolerate up to 1/2 white noise.

The latter can break the axial and equatorial symmetry of the Kerr metric and have a much richer multipolar structure, providing a portal to constrain fuzzball models phenomenologically. We find numerical evidence that all multipole moments are typically larger (in absolute value) than those of a Kerr black hole with the same mass and spin. Current measurements of the quadrupole moment of black-hole candidates impose only mild constraints on fuzzballs, while future gravitational-wave detections of extreme mass-ratio inspirals with the space mission LISA will improve these bounds by orders of magnitude, thereby providing a more stringent test of these models."
209,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,paper_abstract,"Reasoning about graphs evolving over time is a challenging concept in many domains, such as bioinformatics, physics, and social networks. We consider a common case in which edges can be short-term interactions (e.g., messaging) or long-term structural connections (e.g., friendship). In practice, long-term edges are often specified by humans. Human-specified edges can be both expensive to produce and suboptimal for the downstream task. To alleviate these issues, we propose a model based on temporal point processes and variational autoencoders that learns to infer temporal attention between nodes by observing node communication."
210,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,paper_abstract,"Observations of thermally driven transverse vibration of a photonic crystal waveguide (PCW) are reported. The PCW consists of two parallel nanobeams with a 240 nanometer vacuum gap between the beams. Models are developed and validated for transducing beam motion to phase and amplitude modulation of a weak optical probe propagating in a guided mode of the PCW for probe frequencies far from and near to the dielectric band edge. Since our PCW has been designed for near-field atom trapping, this research provides a foundation for evaluating possible deleterious effects of thermal motion on optical atomic traps near the surfaces of PCWs. Longer-term goals are to achieve strong atom-mediated links between individual phonons of vibration and single photons propagating in the GMs of the PCW, thereby enabling opto-mechanics at the quantum level with atoms, photons, and phonons, and potentially paving the way for novel applications in quantum communication and sensing."
211,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,paper_abstract,"We establish natural splittings for the values of global Mackey functors at orthogonal, unitary, and symplectic groups. In particular, the restriction homomorphisms between the orthogonal, unitary, and symplectic groups of adjacent dimensions are naturally split epimorphisms. The interest in the splitting comes from equivariant stable homotopy theory. The equivariant stable homotopy groups of every global spectrum form a global Mackey functor, so the splittings imply that certain long exact homotopy group sequences split into short exact sequences."
212,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,paper_abstract,"Baryonic feedback effects lead to a suppression of the weak lensing angular power spectrum on small scales. The poorly constrained shape and amplitude of this suppression are an important source of uncertainties for upcoming cosmological weak lensing surveys such as Euclid or LSST. In this first paper in a series of two, we use simulations to build a Euclid-like tomographic mock data-set for the cosmic shear power spectrum and the corresponding covariance matrix, which are both corrected for baryonic effects following the baryonification method of Schneider et al.

Nevertheless, building speech processing models capable of handling such a wide variety of conditions would be particularly useful for language acquisition studies, where researchers are interested in the quantity and quality of the speech that children hear and produce, as well as for early diagnosis and measuring the effects of remediation. In this paper, we present our approach to designing an open-source neural network to classify audio segments into vocalizations produced by the child wearing the recording device, vocalizations produced by other children, adult male speech, and adult female speech. To this end, we gathered diverse child-centered corpora, which sums up to a total of 260 hours of recordings, covering 10 languages."
214,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,paper_abstract,"Density-based clustering relies on the idea of linking groups to specific features of the probability distribution underlying the data, allowing for a true, yet unknown, population structure to be framed in a standard inferential setting. The concept of ideal population clustering is defined as the partition induced by the true density function. The nonparametric formulation of this approach, known as modal clustering, draws a correspondence between the groups and the domains of attraction of the density modes. A nonparametric density estimate is required, and the proper selection of the amount of smoothing, governing the shape of the density and hence possibly the modal structure, is crucial to identify the final partition."
215,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,paper_abstract,"The tails of diboson production at the LHC are sensitive to the interference between standard model and higher-dimensional operators parameterizing the effects of heavy new physics. However, helicity selection rules for the diboson scattering amplitudes set an obstruction to the naive interference contributions of dimension six operators, causing the total diboson rate correction's leading contribution to cancel. In this case, carefully measuring the azimuthal decay angles ""resurrects"" the interference, recouping sensitivity to the ""non-interfering"" operators. We explore these signatures in detail, and find that the EFT uncertainties associated with higher-dimensional operators are uniquely well-suppressed by the construction of an asymmetry variable, which is only generated by these non-interfering operators, relegating the effects of higher-dimensional, interfering operators to the same status as statistical errors in this observable."
216,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,paper_abstract,"Causal inference from observational data is the goal of many data analyses in the health and social sciences. However, academic statistics has often frowned upon data analyses with a causal objective. The introduction of the term ""data science"" provides a historic opportunity to redefine data analysis in such a way that it naturally accommodates causal inference from observational data. Like others before, we organize the scientific contributions of data science into three classes of tasks  description, prediction, and counterfactual prediction (which includes causal inference). An explicit classification of data science tasks is necessary to discuss the data, assumptions, and analytics required to successfully accomplish each task. We argue that a failure to adequately describe the role of subject-matter expert knowledge in data analysis is a source of widespread misunderstandings about data science, and vice versa."
217,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,paper_abstract,"The weak gravity conjecture (WGC) demands the existence of super-extremal particles in any consistent quantum theory of gravity. The standard lore is that these particles are introduced to ensure that extreme black holes are either unstable or marginally stable, but it is unclear what goes wrong if this doesn't happen. This note shows that, for a generic Einsteinian quantum theory of gravity in AdS, the stability of extreme black branes is in tension with rigorously proven quantum information theorems about entanglement entropy. Avoiding this contradiction leads to a non-perturbative version of the WGC, which reduces to the usual statement at weak coupling. The argument is general and does not rely on either supersymmetry or a particular UV completion, assuming only the validity of Einsteinian gravity, effective field theory, and holography."
218,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,paper_abstract,"Understanding how strongly correlated two-dimensional (2d) systems can give rise to unconventional superconductivity with high critical temperatures is a major unsolved problem in condensed matter physics. Ultracold 2d fermi gases have emerged as clean and controllable model systems to study the interplay of strong correlations and reduced dimensionality, but direct evidence of superfluidity has been missing. Here, we demonstrate superfluidity in an ultracold 2d fermi gas by moving a periodic potential through the system and observing no dissipation below a critical velocity. We measure the critical velocity as a function of interaction strength and find a maximum in the crossover regime between bosonic and fermionic superfluidity. Our measurement establishes ultracold fermi gases as a powerful tool for studying the influence of reduced dimensionality on strongly correlated superfluids and superconductors."
219,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,paper_abstract,"Ordinary differential equation (ODE) is a mathematical model widely used in various application areas, such as climatology, bioinformatics, and chemical engineering, with its intuitive appeal to modeling. Despite ODE's widespread usage in modeling, frequent absence of their analytical solutions makes it challenging to estimate ODE parameters from the data, especially when the model has many variables and parameters. This paper proposes a Bayesian ODE parameter estimation algorithm that is fast and accurate even for models with numerous parameters. The proposed method approximates an ODE model with a state-space model based on equations of a numeric solver. It enables fast estimation by avoiding computations of the whole numerical solution in the likelihood. The posterior is obtained by a variational Bayesian method, specifically, the approximate Riemannian conjugate gradient method."
220,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,paper_abstract,"We study the transport properties and superconducting proximity effect in NSN junctions formed by a time-reversal symmetry broken Weyl semimetal (WSM) in proximity to an S-wave superconductor. We find that the differential conductance and induced pairing amplitudes strongly depend on the angle between the junction direction in real space and the axis separating the Weyl nodes in momentum space. We identify the influence of a chiral chemical potential, i.e., the electron population imbalance between Weyl nodes of opposite chirality, on the transport characteristics of the junction. Remarkably, we observe a net spin polarization of Cooper pairs that are generated via Andreev reflection in the two WSM regions. The spin polarization is opposite in the two WSM regions and highly sensitive to the chirality imbalance and excitation energy."
221,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,paper_abstract,"Metal ion implantation into ceramics has been demonstrated to be an effective and controllable technique for tailoring the surface electrical conductivity of the ceramic piece, and this approach has been used in a number of applications. Importantly, it provides a method for grading the voltage drop across high-voltage insulators, thereby increasing the maximum operational voltage that can be applied across the insulator without surface flashover. However, a concern for the use of this method is the long-term stability of the implantation-induced conductivity, especially if the implanted metal species is readily oxidized. Here, we report on our examination of the long-term behavior of the surface conductivity of titanium-implanted alumina. The results indicate that after an initial drop of as much as 40% in the first few weeks after implantation, the conductivity shows a very slow decrease of about 10% over the following year, suggesting a relatively stable surface conductivity."
222,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,paper_abstract,"We introduce a novel, Skyrme-like conserved current in the effective theory of pions and vector mesons, rooted in the concept of hidden local symmetry. The associated charge is equivalent to the skyrmion charge for any smooth configuration. Additionally, there exist singular configurations that can be identified as n_f=1 baryons charged under the new symmetry. Under this identification, the vector mesons play the role of Chern-Simons vector fields residing on the quantum Hall droplet that forms the n_f=1 baryon. We propose that this current is the correct effective expression for the baryon current at low energies. This proposal yields a unified picture for the two types of baryons, allowing them to naturally transform into one another. Moreover, Chern-Simons dualities on the droplet can be seen as a result of Seiberg-like duality between gluons and vector mesons."
223,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,paper_abstract,"Interfacial spin-orbit coupling in Josephson junctions offers an intriguing way to combine anomalous Hall and Josephson physics in a single device. We theoretically investigate how the superposition of both effects impacts the transport properties of superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator/superconductor junctions. Transverse momentum-dependent skew tunneling of Cooper pairs through the spin-active ferromagnetic insulator interface generates sizable transverse Hall supercurrents, which we refer to as anomalous Josephson Hall effect currents. We generalize the Furusaki-Tsukada formula, initially established to quantify usual Josephson current flows, to evaluate the transverse current components and demonstrate that their amplitudes are widely adjustable by means of the spin-orbit coupling strengths or the superconducting phase difference across the junction. As a clear spectroscopic fingerprint of Josephson junctions, well-localized subgap bound states form around the interface."
224,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,paper_abstract,"Following the suggestion from the Monte-Carlo experiments in Jim\'enez (2020), it is found that dipoles are as important to the dynamics of decaying two-dimensional turbulence as individual vortex cores. The kinetic energy of this flow is carried by elongated streams formed by the concatenation of dipoles. Vortices separate into a family of small fast-moving cores and another family of larger slowly moving ones, which can be described as `frozen' into a slowly evolving `crystal'. The kinematics of both families are very different, and only the former is self-similar."

Often, the running time of quantum algorithms in this framework is characterized by the quantum hitting time  the time required by the quantum walk to find a vertex of interest with a high probability. In this article, we provide improved upper bounds for the quantum hitting time that can be applied to several ctqw-based quantum algorithms. In particular, we apply our techniques to the glued-trees problem, improving their hitting time upper bound by a polynomial factor  from o(n^5) to o(n^2logn). Furthermore, our methods also help to exponentially improve the dependence on precision of the continuous-time quantum walk based algorithm to find a marked node on any ergodic, reversible markov chain."

Dry (or the ""loss-cone"") EMRIs, previously considered as the main EMRI sources for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, are primarily produced by multi-body scattering in the nuclear star cluster and gravitational capture. In this letter, we highlight an alternative EMRI formation channel  wet EMRI formation assisted by the accretion flow around accreting galactic-center massive black holes (MBHs). In this channel, the accretion disk captures stellar-mass black holes that are initially moving on inclined orbits, and subsequently drives them to migrate towards the MBH, this process boosts the formation rate of EMRIs in such galaxies by orders of magnitude."

This problem falls into the new user cold-start category and is crucial to the development and survival of a company. Existing works on user cold-start recommendation either require additional user efforts, e.g., setting up an interview process, or making use of side information such as user demographics, locations, social relations, etc. However, users may not be willing to take the interview and side information on cold-start users is usually not available."

It has also been successfully applied in wireless communications, even though the current radio systems are well-understood and optimal algorithms exist for many tasks. While some gains have been achieved by learning individual parts of a receiver, a better approach is to jointly learn the whole receiver. This often results in a challenging nonlinear problem, for which the optimal solution is infeasible to implement. To address this, we propose a deep fully convolutional neural network, deeprx, which executes the whole receiver pipeline from frequency domain signal stream to uncoded bits in a 5G-compliant manner."

A corpus of potential seeds will often contain thousands of similar inputs. This lack of diversity can lead to wasted fuzzing effort by exhaustive mutation from all available seeds. To address this, fuzzers come with distillation tools that select the smallest subset of seeds that triggers the same range of instrumentation data points as the full corpus. Common practice suggests that minimizing the number and cumulative size of the seeds leads to more efficient fuzzing, which we explore systematically."

The agents can be grouped into several categories, each of which has similar state transition structures, and can be relabeled into the same template. Based on the template, a scalable supervisor with state size and computational cost independent of the number of agents is designed for the case of partial observation. The scalable supervisor under partial observation does not need to be re-computed regardless of how many agents are added to or removed from the system. We generalize our earlier results to partial observation by proposing sufficient conditions for safety and maximal permissiveness of the scalable least restrictive supervisor on the template level. An example is provided to illustrate the proposed scalable supervisory synthesis."

An efficient approach for ENF estimation is introduced with temporal windowing based on the filter-bank capon spectral estimator. A type of Gohberg-Semencul factorization of the model covariance matrix is used due to the Toeplitz structure of the covariance matrix. Moreover, this approach uses, for the first time in the field of ENF, a temporal window, not necessarily the rectangular one, at the stage preceding spectral estimation. Krylov matrices are employed for fast implementation of matrix inversions. The proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in ENF estimation, when a short time window of 1 second is employed in power recordings. In speech recordings, the proposed approach yields highly accurate results with respect to both time complexity and accuracy."

233,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,paper_abstract,"The nonlinear fluorescence emission has been widely applied for high-resolution optical imaging. We studied the fluorescence anomalous saturating effect of the nitrogen vacancy defect in diamond. The fluorescence reduction was observed with high-power laser excitation. It increased the nonlinearity of the fluorescence emission, and altered the spatial frequency distribution of the fluorescence image. We used a differential excitation protocol to extract high spatial frequency information. By modulating the excitation laser's power, the spatial resolution of imaging improved approximately 1.6 times compared to confocal microscopy. The simplicity of the experimental setup and data processing enables this method to be used for improving the spatial resolution of sensing and biological labeling with defects in solids."
234,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,paper_abstract,"When random effects are correlated with sample design variables, the usual approach of employing individual survey weights, constructed to be inversely proportional to the unit survey inclusion probabilities, no longer produces asymptotically unbiased inference. We construct a weight-exponentiated formulation for the random effects distribution that achieves unbiased inference for generating hyperparameters of the random effects. Our approach is contrasted with frequentist methods that rely on numerical integration, revealing that only the Bayesian method achieves both unbiased estimation with respect to the sampling design distribution and consistency with respect to the population generating distribution. Our simulations and real-data example for a survey of business establishments demonstrate the utility of our approach across different modeling formulations and sampling designs. This work serves as a capstone for recent developmental efforts that combine traditional survey estimation approaches with the Bayesian modeling paradigm, providing a bridge across the two rich but disparate subfields."

For the first time, it was found that in a mesogenic polymer, in contrast to low-molecular-weight mesogens, the relaxation of the electric birefringence of a melt above the temperature of the nematic-isotropic phase transition can be presented by a sum of several exponential processes, two of which play a decisive role. These main processes replace each other in a temperature range of about fifty degrees. Dielectric spectroscopy also made it possible to distinguish two processes of orientational relaxation  the first is due to the rotation of the side mesogenic groups, and the second is associated with the motion of the main chain segments."

How to optimize discrete hash bits is always the focus in deep hashing methods. A common strategy in these methods is to adopt an activation function, e.g. sigmoid or tanh, and minimize a quantization loss to approximate discrete values. However, this paradigm may make more hash bits stuck into the wrong saturated area of the activation functions and never escaped. We call this problem ""dead bits problem."" Besides, the existing quantization loss will exacerbate dbp as well. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective gradient amplifier, which acts before activation functions to alleviate dbp."

The former is constrained by disappearing charged track searches at the LHC and by dark matter direct detection experiments, while the latter is constrained by existing multilepton collider searches. We find that a two-step electroweak phase transition involving a stable triplet with a negative quadratic term is ruled out by direct detection searches, while an unstable triplet with a mass less than 230 GeV is excluded at 95% confidence level."

The standard scenario proposes an initially circular and narrow belt of planetesimals at semi-major axis a, whose eccentricity is increased to ef after the gas disc has dispersed by secular perturbations from an eccentric planet, resulting in a belt of width 2ae_f. In a minor modification of this scenario, narrower belts can arise if the planetesimals are initially eccentric, which could result from earlier planet perturbations during the gas-rich protoplanetary disc phase. Alternatively, a primordial eccentricity could be caused by instabilities that increase the disc eccentricity, without the need for any planets."

We demonstrate analytically that the few-get-richer effect emerges when people tend to click on top-ranked items and have heterogeneous preferences for the classes of items.

The stone-hearted miser, plagued by the ghost of Christmas past. More than a century after his death, these remain recognizable figures from the work of Charles Dickens. So striking is his body of work that it gave rise to its own adjective. But what are the features of Dickens's writing that make it so special? Dickens's fiction brims with anticipation through brooding settings, plot twists, and mysteries. These features of his work kept his audience wanting more."

Before I discuss this technology further, let's take a brief look at what human characters look like in computer games. This is a clip from a game called ""Grand Theft Auto 3.""

Let's start with an account about a culture that thrived in Micronesia in the early 1900s, known as the Yap. Their unique form of currency is truly captivating. The Yap people utilize limestone discs, called Rai stones. Notably, the Yap do not physically move these Rai stones around or exchange them like we do with our coins, as Rai stones can become quite massive. The largest is approximately four tons and 12 feet in diameter. Therefore, the Yap simply keep track of who owns a part of what stone. There's an intriguing story about these sailors who were transporting a stone across the ocean when they encountered some trouble and the stone actually fell in."
261,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,speech,"You've been accused of a crime you did not commit. It's impossible to prove your innocence. If you insist on claiming innocence, you'll likely be found guilty and executed. However, if you confess, apologize, and implicate others, you'll be set free. Do you give a false confession or risk a public hanging? This was the daunting choice facing those accused of witchcraft in Salem, Massachusetts, between February 1692 and May 1693. They were the victims of mass hysteria, misdirected religious fervor, and a justice system that prioritized repentance over truth. Salem was founded in 1626 by the Puritans, a group of English Protestants who settled in the New World. Life was rigid and isolated for the people of Salem, marked by frequent battles with Native American neighbors and French settlers."

Unfortunately, there aren't nearly enough donor organs available to fill that demand. What if instead of waiting, we could create brand-new, customized organs from scratch? That's the idea behind bioprinting, a branch of regenerative medicine currently under development. We're not yet able to print complex organs, but simpler tissues including blood vessels and tubes responsible for nutrient and waste exchange are already in our grasp. Bioprinting is a biological cousin of 3D printing, a technique that deposits layers of material on top of each other to construct a three-dimensional object one slice at a time."

I'll begin with an anecdote, reminiscent of a Monty Python-esque sketch. It's December 15, 2010. Someone offers you a bet  you'll gaze into a crystal ball, and the future will be revealed; the future will be accurate. But you must share it with the world. Okay, curiosity got the better of you, you take the bet, you gaze into the crystal ball. One hour later, you're seated in a prominent national TV show, and you recount the story."

I began with that sentence about 12 years ago, and I started in the context of developing countries, but you're sitting here from every corner of the world. So, if you think of a map of your country, I believe you'll realize that for every country on earth, you could draw little circles to say, ""these are places where good teachers won't go."" On top of that, those are the places from where trouble often comes. So we have an ironic problem – good teachers don't want to go to just those places where they're needed the most. I started in 1999 to try and address this problem with an experiment, which was a very simple experiment in New Delhi."

And I ask my students these two questions, and then I share how I answer them, which is in these three sentences that go  I am the daughter of black writers, who are descended from freedom fighters who broke their chains and changed the world. They call me, and these words I repeat in a mantra before every single poetry performance, in fact, I was doing it in the corner over there, making faces."

I was a self-employed living statue called the eight-foot bride, and I loved telling people I did this for a job, because everybody always wants to know, who are these freaks in real life. Hello. I painted myself white one day, stood on a box, put a hat or a can at my feet, and when someone came by and dropped in money, I handed them a flower – and some intense eye contact. And if they didn't take the flower, I threw in a gesture of sadness and longing – as they walked away."
269,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,speech,"On October 4, 1957, the world watched in awe and trepidation as the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the world's first artificial satellite, into space. This small, two-foot-diameter metal sphere launched a space race between the US and USSR that would last for eighteen years and reshape the world as we know it. Sputnik was not the first human-made object to enter space; that distinction belongs to the V-2 rocket used by Germany during World War II. Although ineffective, the V-2 rocket's technology and scientists were captured by both the US and USSR at war's end, leading them to incorporate it into their own projects."

As I speak to you now, over 800 million women worldwide are experiencing a period. None of us would exist without it, yet it remains an ""embarrassing"" subject to discuss. From my experience and that of the women around me, I can tell you it's draining. It's draining to carefully remove a brown paper bag, stuffing it into your pocket in the midst of a class, rushing to the washroom, and attempting to be discreet. It's draining to sit through lessons and meetings, pretending to be completely normal, while internally crying out from intense period cramps."

Unfortunately, I couldn't find one of them, but I have the antlers as proof. Across the boreal, we're blessed with an incredible abundance of wetlands.

Four brothers wandered this celestial realm, having no family other than each other - they didn't even know who their parents were. One of the brothers, Deminan, looked different from the others. His skin was covered in painful scabs, and he wondered why he alone had been marked with this affliction. One day, while the supreme spirit Yaya was out in his gardens, Deminan and his brothers snuck into Yaya's house. After feasting and exploring, they spotted a giant gourd hanging in the corner. But as they tried to look inside the gourd, they dropped it."

At the time, there wasn't much information available about the company, but the limited information that was available was truly impressive. Essentially, what the company was doing was developing a medical device allowing you to run your entire blood panel on a finger-stick of blood. This was intriguing not only because it was less invasive, but also, it could potentially open the door to predictive diagnostics."
276,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,speech,"My journey to become a polar specialist, specializing in the polar regions, began when I was four years old, when my family moved from southern Canada to northern Baffin Island, up by Greenland. There, we lived with the Inuit in the tiny Inuit community of 200 Inuit people, where we were one of three non-Inuit families. And in this community, we didn't have a television; we didn't have computers, of course, or radio. We didn't even have a telephone. All of my time was spent outside with the Inuit, playing. The snow and the ice were my playground, and the Inuit were my mentors. And that's where I became truly passionate about this polar realm."

To accomplish this, I need to explain to you something about the origin of our solar system. Four and a half billion years ago, a cloud of gas and dust existed. In its center, our sun formed and ignited. Alongside that, what we now know as planets, comets, and asteroids formed. According to theory, when the Earth had cooled slightly after its formation, comets massively impacted the Earth, delivering water to our planet. They likely also delivered complex organic material to Earth, which may have bootstrapped the emergence of life."

You know, when we created this ""build back better"" series, our thought was how could we address issues arising out of the pandemic, how could we imagine building back from that. But the events of this past week, the horrific death of George Floyd and the daily protests that have followed, I mean, they provided a new urgency, which we simply have to address. I mean, can we build back better from this? I think before we can even start to answer that question, we just have to seek to understand the magnitude of this moment."

President Theodore Roosevelt slept among towering sequoia trees, braved a snowstorm, and spent hours conversing around the campfire with his host and guide, conservationist John Muir. Roosevelt was an avid outdoorsman, but Muir had invited him to Yosemite for a greater purpose: the valley was in danger of overdevelopment. Although Yosemite was protected land since 1864, it still faced threats in 1903. The battle to set aside land for preservation and public use had been ongoing for decades, with two seemingly conflicting goals that proved challenging to reconcile. This struggle began with the 1849 gold rush, when miners flocked to the Sierra Nevada foothills in search of gold."

So how can you avoid being misled by grabby headlines? The best way to assess a headline's credibility is to look at the original research it reports on."

If you were given the choice to sign up for that kind of existence, would you? That's the question philosopher Robert Nozick posed through a thought experiment he called the experience machine. The experiment asks us to consider a world in which scientists have developed a machine that would simulate real life while guaranteeing experiences of only pleasure and never pain. The catch? You have to permanently leave reality behind, but you'll hardly know the difference. Your experiences will be indistinguishable from reality."

That was because it became clear that the next big threat facing not only my city, but other cities around the country, was not the one-and-done disaster, where you can ride in like the cavalry, as a firefighter, put out the fire and leave, feeling like you have made a difference, but a prolonged and ongoing battle against health threats, requiring a deeper understanding of medical emergencies."
288,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,speech,"Where does all the carbon we release go? Carbon works in a natural cycle, present in all living things  in the soil, in the oceans, in the atmosphere, and in rocks deep underground. When plants and other living things die, much of their stored carbon makes its way back to the atmosphere, where it's absorbed by new plants and trees, until new plants grow and reabsorb the carbon. However, over millions of years, some of the carbon stored in ancient trees and sea life becomes rock and some becomes fossil fuels  coal, oil, and natural gas. Natural events like volcanic eruptions release some of the carbon trapped in rock. Additionally, human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, also release some of that prehistoric carbon. Today, humans release around 60 times more carbon than all the volcanoes on the planet each year."
289,hybrid,none,none,polish_20,speech,"Even nature's most reviled creatures hold important secrets, but who would desire a swarm of cockroaches approaching them? Yet, one of the greatest disparities between natural and human technologies lies in robustness. Robust systems remain stable in complex and novel environments. Remarkably, cockroaches can self-stabilize while running over rough terrain. When we attached a jet pack to them, or introduced a perturbation like an earthquake, we found that their exquisitely tuned legs enable them to self-stabilize without utilizing any brainpower. They can traverse complex terrain, such as grass, effortlessly, without becoming destabilized. We discovered a new behavior, where, due to their shape, they naturally roll onto their side to navigate this artificial test patch of grass. Robust systems can perform multiple tasks with the same structure. Here, we've uncovered a new behavior."

Now, organized crime has been around for a very long time, and these would be wise words, indeed. However, in the last two decades, it has experienced an unprecedented expansion, now accounting for roughly 15% of the world's GDP.

But what got me from there to here wasn't the punishment I faced as a teenager in adult prison or the harshness of our legal system.

That's just how the media has been portraying people who look like me. One study found that 80 percent of news coverage about Islam and Muslims is negative.

And, like many 20-somethings, I expected to solve the world's problems – more specifically, the world's water problems – with my technology. I had a lot to learn.
