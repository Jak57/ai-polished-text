We may get the keys at closing, and I am getting so excited. If all goes well this week, we will be set for closing a week from Wednesday.

Here's my rundown; last night we watched Thirteen, a movie every mother of a teen should see. It was better than I expected.

He argues that using place as the center of culture gives a more grounded community.

I particularly enjoyed the 'dual play' segments (where you can play batman + 1 more), and the ability to use the controller for most parts of the game but the mouse and keyboard for the tank combat segments was greatly appreciated.

At first the game set it to high and it was running a bit sluggishly but not to the point of being unplayable, but when I dropped it down to medium it smoothed right out. Not sure if I am just lucky when it comes to having issues with games or what, but it seems that most of the negative reviews sound like they are coming from some really entitled people.""

The deadline marks the point at which Fiat will gain the right to sell its car division to GM, part of an alliance agreed in 2000. GM, whose own European operations are losing money, no longer wants to own the unprofitable Fiat unit.

The US firm is thought to be offering about $2bn (£1.06bn) to extricate itself from the arrangement. It has argued the deal was voided by Fiat's decision to sell off its finance arm and halve GM's stake via a capital-raising effort.

The nonparametric formulation of this approach, known as modal clustering, establishes a correspondence between the groups and the domains of attraction of the density modes.

This note shows that, for a generic Einstein quantum theory of gravity in AdS, exact stability of extremal black branes is in tension with rigorously proven quantum information theorems about entanglement entropy. Avoiding the contradiction leads to a nonperturbative version of the WGC, which reduces to the usual statement at weak coupling.

It has also been successfully applied in wireless communications, even though current radio systems are well-understood and optimal algorithms exist for many tasks. While some gains have been achieved by learning individual parts of a receiver, a better approach is to jointly learn the entire receiver. This, however, often results in a challenging nonlinear problem, for which the optimal solution is impractical to implement. To this end, we propose a deep fully convolutional neural network, deeprx, which executes the whole receiver pipeline from frequency domain signal stream to uncoded bits in a 5g-compliant manner. We enable accurate channel estimation by constructing the input of the convolutional neural network in a very specific way using both the data and pilot symbols.""

A corpus of potential seeds will often contain thousands of similar inputs. This lack of diversity can lead to wasted fuzzing effort by excessive mutation from all available seeds. To address this, fuzzers include distillation tools (e.g., afl-cmin) that select the smallest subset of seeds that triggers the same range of instrumentation data points as the full corpus. Common practice suggests that minimizing the number and cumulative size of the seeds leads to more efficient fuzzing, which we examine systematically. We present results of 34+ cpu-years of fuzzing with five distillation approaches to understand their impact in discovering bugs in real-world software.""

The scalable supervisor under partial observation does not need to be recomputed regardless of how many agents are added to or removed from the system.

We demonstrate analytically that the few-get-richer effect arises when people tend to click on top-ranked items and have diverse preferences for the classes of items.

To solve this problem, we introduce a new sparsity dimension, namely pattern-based sparsity that comprises pattern and connectivity sparsity, and becomes both highly accurate and hardware friendly. With carefully designed patterns, the proposed pruning method consistently achieves accuracy enhancement and better feature extraction ability on different DNN structures and datasets, and our pattern-aware pruning framework also accomplishes pattern library extraction, pattern selection, pattern and connectivity pruning and weight training simultaneously.

272,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,speech,"Menstruation. A simple word describing a natural biological process, weighed down by centuries of stigma, has been transformed into something most of us can only speak about in whispers. But why? As I speak to you right now, more than 800 million women around the world are having a period. None of us would exist without it, and yet it remains an ""embarrassing"" subject to broach. From my experience and that of the women around me, I can tell you that it's exhausting. It's exhausting to carefully take out a brown paper bag hiding a pad, stuffing it into your pocket in the middle of a class and rushing to the washroom as discreetly as possible. It's exhausting to sit through lessons and meetings pretending to be perfectly normal, while internally crying out from intense period cramps.""

276,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,speech,"My journey to become a polar specialist, photographing and specializing in the polar regions, began when I was four years old, when my family moved from southern Canada to northern Baffin Island, up by Greenland. There we lived with the Inuit in the tiny Inuit community of 200 people, where we were one of three non-Inuit families. And in this community, we didn't have a television; we didn't have computers, obviously, or radio. We didn't even have a telephone. All of my time was spent outside with the Inuit, playing. The snow and the ice were my sandbox, and the Inuit were my teachers. And that's where I became truly obsessed with this polar realm.""

278,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,speech,"I'd like to take you on the epic journey of the Rosetta spacecraft. To escort and land the probe on a comet has been my passion for the past two years. In order to do that, I need to explain to you something about the origin of the solar system. When we go back four and a half billion years, there was a cloud of gas and dust. In the center of this cloud, our sun formed and ignited. Along with that, what we now know as planets, comets, and asteroids formed. What then happened, according to theory, is that when the earth had cooled down a bit after its formation, comets massively impacted the earth and delivered water to it. They probably also delivered complex organic material to earth, and that may have triggered the emergence of life."
279,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,speech,"Chris Anderson: Hello, TED community, welcome back for another live conversation. It's a significant one today, as big as they get. You know, when we created this 'Build Back Better' series, our thought was how we could address issues arising from the pandemic, how we could imagine rebuilding after that. But the events of this past week, the horrific death of George Floyd and the daily protests that have followed, I mean, they provided a new urgency which we, of course, simply have to address. I mean, can we build back better from this? I think before we can even start to answer that question, we just have to seek to understand the immensity of this moment.

285,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,speech,"Imagine if you could plug your brain into a machine that would bring you ultimate pleasure for the rest of your life. If you were given the choice to sign up for that kind of existence, would you? That’s the question philosopher Robert Nozick posed through a thought experiment he called the experience machine. The experiment asks us to consider a world in which scientists have developed a machine that would simulate real life while guaranteeing experiences of only pleasure and never pain. The catch? You have to permanently leave reality behind, but you'll hardly notice the difference. Your experiences will be indistinguishable from reality. Life's natural ups and downs will simply be replaced with an endless series of ups. Sounds great, right?""

286,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,speech,"I would like to tell you about the most embarrassing thing that has ever happened to me in my years of working as a palliative care physician. This occurred a couple of years ago. I was asked as a consultant to see a woman in her 70s — a retired English professor who had pancreatic cancer. I was asked to see her because she had pain, nausea, vomiting ... When I went to see her, we discussed those symptoms and in the course of that consultation, she asked me whether I thought that medical marijuana might help her. I thought back to everything that I had learned in medical school about medical marijuana, which didn't take very long because I had learned absolutely nothing.""

As firefighters, my team and I are tasked with saving lives and property from such disasters as car wrecks, house fires, and life-threatening medical emergencies. I am a woman leading a department in a male-dominated profession, and 10 years ago, I decided to expand my medical knowledge and earned a nursing degree. That was because it became clear that the next big threat facing not only my city, but other cities around the country, was not the one-and-done disaster, where you can ride in like the cavalry, as a firefighter, put out the fire and leave, feeling like you have made a difference and everything is okay.

289,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,speech,"Even nature's most disgusting creatures hold important secrets, but who would want a swarm of cockroaches coming towards them? Yet one of the greatest differences between natural and human technologies relates to robustness. Robust systems are stable in complex and new environments. Remarkably, cockroaches can self-stabilize running over rough terrain. When we attach a jet pack to them, or introduce a perturbation like an earthquake, we discovered that their wonderfully tuned legs allow them to self-stabilize without using any of their brainpower. They can traverse complex terrain like grass, no problem, and not get destabilized. We uncovered a new behavior where, because of their shape, they actually roll automatically to their side to go through this artificial test patch of grass. Robust systems can perform multiple tasks with the same structure. Here's a new behavior we've discovered.""

Comparable, in its own very peculiar way, to the achievements of Microsoft or Google. And it's an industry which has weathered the current recession with equanimity. I refer to organized crime. Now organized crime has been around for a very long time, I hear you say, and these would be wise words, indeed. But in the last two decades, it has undergone an unprecedented expansion, now accounting for roughly 15 percent of the world's GDP. I like to call it the global shadow economy, or McMafia, for short.

But what got me from there to here wasn't the punishment I faced as a teenager in adult prison or the harshness of our legal system. Instead, it was the learning environment of a classroom that introduced me to something I didn't think was possible for me or our justice system as a whole. A few weeks before my release on parole, a counselor encouraged me to enroll in a new college course being offered in the prison.

We can transmit really complicated thoughts to one another. So what I'm doing right now is, I'm making sounds with my mouth as I'm exhaling. I'm making tones and hisses and puffs, and those are creating air vibrations in the air. Those air vibrations are traveling to you, they're hitting your eardrums, and then your brain takes those vibrations from your eardrums and transforms them into thoughts. I hope.

There was even a story recently that scientists had thought about actually replacing rats in their experiments with politicians. And someone asked, ""Why?"" and they said, ""Well, there's no shortage of politicians, no one really minds what happens to them and, after all, there are some things that rats just won't do.""
