We may get the keys at closing, **and** I am getting so excited. If all goes well this week, we will be set for closing a week from **Wednesday**. I was up until after 3:00am last night watching movies with Bethany. There has been a lot of movie watching going on around here lately. Here's my rundown; last night we watched **Thirteen**, a movie every mother of a teen should see. It was better **than** I expected. Then we watched **Gigli**, yeah it was just as bad as the media said it was, but we had to see for ourselves."
2,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,blog,"Summer TV in the summer used to be a dead zone full of repeats or something. But now there are two great new shows on TV and I have been watching both religiously for the last week. *Blow Out*, the gayest concept ever that seemingly has zero gay people in sight. Hairstylist Jonathan Antin wants to build a second location to his incredibly popular West Hollywood salon but this time in Beverly Hills. Normally no one would care, certainly not I, but as I was flipping through the channels I caught a glimpse of Jonathan, equally narcissistic and dull, looking at an empty space on Rodeo Dr. saying (in a public voice) 'I am going to build here the greatest salon in the history of the world ever!' and I was hooked. Not since Rocco have I found such a moron compelling TV watching."

It kills me. I can't move it much now because I was on a spree updating my website and working on other online things. I can barely muster strength to draw anything. Lack of sleep adds to my pain. I'm not too happy right now, but I'll get better. My mom's surgery went okay. Her eyesight has come back some. She can see fuzzy shapes and make out colors. Other than that she's still blind as all sin. Hopefully she'll fully regain her vision soon."

I also learned how remarkably sweet total strangers can be for no reason other than because they feel like being kind. Trust me. It wasn't like they were trying to get into my pants or anything. I had kid drool all over me and was wearing my 'wash-day' outfit... Also, I'm not super sure I'll ever be bathing again so it's not like there was even an olfactory incentive there! I am doing two things right now. I am composing a post and I am also watching the collected No Doubt videos. I am doing both of these things sitting at my desk in my room."
5,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,blog,"So it is 11:14pm MST, and here I sit in my bedroom repairing the personal computer of the personnel director from my job. Not that I mind doing it, but I wonder sometimes at how often I find myself fixing someone else's computer as a favour. I'm glad to be able to love and serve people this way, but where is the line drawn when it comes to the point that you are being taken advantage of? The last couple of weeks, I've been staying up late reading and such, so I was looking forward to hitting the sack early, until I realized it would be more prudent to get this computer out of my bedroom and back into its owner's hands. *laugh* No rest for the weary, right? So I found myself watching Joe Schmo 2 again tonight."

So, after the weird lunch, my confidence shook, I forgot to tell you guys an important piece of the story. Before Pat shows up to lunch, Dustin starts talking about what a great guy Pat is and how he's trying to find a girlfriend for him. I'm listening and nodding and realizing that we're talking more about finding Dustin's best friend a girl, than discussing whatever it is you discuss with a stranger over pink lemonade. I excused myself to the bathroom, looked in the mirror, and then silently asked myself: am I being pawned off to the other guy? Is this what happens now?"

I'd like each and every single person in the world to think before they get out of bed in the morning, and make a commitment to keep thinking all day. If they're not prepared to, I'd very much prefer they hop the fuck back in bed and drift off to an eternal slumber. I'm sick to death of stupid people. No, I'm not the smartest motherfucker in the world... But I'm not talking about things that take a lot of brain power, so I think it's fair to criticize the inanely stupid. Let's see if I can keep this particular rant to a few specific types, and we'll save some for another day. Sound good? Great."
8,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,blog,"Two problems with the scenario outlined in my previous post: 1. True, Bush is stimulating the economy, but in the wrong way. Urllink Robert Rubin told NPR's Marketplace today that Bush could have achieved the same stimulus effect without the long-term debt hangover by implementing different tax cuts, temporary tax cuts that would benefit low and middle income persons. Ah, Robert Rubin. The sound of his name is music to our ears. Quick: name one Bush administration cabinet official on the domestic side with Rubin's gravitas. Still thinking? It'll come to you... 2. We can't give the Republicans control only in wartime because they've ingeniously concocted an endless, global 'war on terrorism.'"

Then you realize how amazing existing is. And suddenly it hits you—the fact that you are going off on this random train of thought is incredibly absurd. Ever had that happen? i hate that. You know what else i hate? block schedules. Who would ever come up with that idea? anyone can see that sitting through a two and a half hour class in any subject is cruel and unusual punishment."

I guess I'm gonna have to be choosy about what I write because I could really take up a lot of time and space, and I just don't have enough energy. First off, I have to say that camp was awesome and even better than I could have expected. God's been doing so much in my life lately, and it's just amazing. I've sort of turned over a new leaf, I guess, but anyway, back to the beginning. We arrived at the Twiggs' house on Friday evening and stayed until we left for camp on Monday.

As a perfectionist, I love excelling at everything I do. But starting new things is a bitch.

14,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,blog,"Arun Shourie talks about how the present governor of Uttar Pradesh had warned, as far back as 1996, about the impending threat of the rise of a urllink 'third Islamic state' in the subcontinent. T V Rajeswar, the former head of the Intelligence Bureau and the current governor of Uttar Pradesh, had predicted this dire threat in a series of articles published in the *Hindustan Times*, way back in 1996. Shourie raises a valid point when he asks, does the fact that you now know that he, and not I, to say nothing of Mr Advani, wrote all that make the warnings ring true? Or do you conclude that because he wrote in this vein, T V Rajeswar is a closet communalist and should not be allowed to continue as governor of Uttar Pradesh?"

Last evening, I went home and just slept, and only got up when my mother called me around eight thirty. And when I woke up, it was all dark, and I hadn't switched the lights on, so I could not figure out what time or date it was. For a few seconds, it was just my mother's voice in the darkness and me grappling with reality. Wonder why I'm feeling so drained... Nice weather this morning. It was drizzling when I came. Although in Calcutta I hear it's been raining for the past three days."
17,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,blog,"Last night was the worst. I threw away the sweater I was knitting. I only had about 14 inches. I lost probably $10 worth of yarn (it's $8 a skein). But it had too many stitches by the time I reached the arm holes and the mohair was tangling itself together as I knitted, so frogging (ripping out rows) didn't work well. The yarn broke a lot. I didn't even swear, which is unusual for me. I just morosely ripped and listened to season two of Sex and the City (way to go, library!). And then I got sick of it and threw it away. I suppose I could say I learned a lot while trying to make this sweater."
18,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,blog,"Last night in class, we were discussing that week’s assigned reading, *Getting Back Into Place: Toward a Renewed Study of the Place-World*, by Edward S. Casey. The first chapter deals with “implacement” and the second, “displacement.” In the first chapter, Casey makes the distinction that our contemporary world and culture revolves around time as the situating force: we are running out of time, we have saved time, we are just in time. He argues that using place as the center of culture gives a more grounded community. (That is a very rough summation, a disclaimer just in case my professor or any other classmate happens to read this post.) So far, this book is the first reading that has grabbed me by the proverbial shoulders."

Finding ourselves in a doorway to a bar sadly closed for business, we stopped to examine an office-supplies catalog that had arrived in the mail. Lucky we did.

Senate republicans okay, hands up - who watched the 39-hour judicial nominations marathon last week? i know i didn't. Well, okay - i did tune in once or twice. The entire colossal waste of time was orchestrated by republicans who, upset that democrats wouldn't roll over and confirm four of bush's extreme justices, were trying to score political points by holding a multi-day cry-fest. Never mind the fact that the democrats have already approved 168 of bush's judicial nominees - nooo, that's not good enough for the power-hungry republicans who are for some reason laboring under the delusion they have a huge mandate for this kind of nonsense."
21,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,blog,"This was a good weekend. I did a lot of god's green leaf, after a long time, I listened to a lot of Nevermore (something I should have started doing much earlier) and read a lot. I finished three books over the weekend - Bruce Sterling's *Heavy Weather*, Larry Niven's *World of Ptavvs*, and Octavia Butler's *Parable of the Sower*. *Heavy Weather* was a fun cyberpunk romp through a near-future USA, devastated by global warming and general anarchy. While it was clever, well-paced and altogether very convincing, I must confess that I failed to come away with any truly significant impressions about the story or the characters. Not that both aren't well constructed and vividly etched—it's a good book, but not a great one, I guess."

Post-practicum trauma was a hidden epidemic that is only now coming to light. I was stricken, but the eventual meeting with the course coordinator allowed me to release my burden, and by doing so I have prevented another person being stuck with such a pedagogically deficient practicum school. Yesterday (Monday) I bumped into another aggrieved classmate who was quite determined to go to the student who was due to go to her school in the next practicum and tell him how terrible it would be. I calmed her down and said that we should go to the administrator first."

I was not then nor am I now a math person. I hate math. I am math phobic. You get the picture. So as I struggled to make sense of algebra, the doorbell rang. I put down my book and went to open the door. No one was there. Great. I returned to my studies and just as I was finding a little glimmer of understanding buried in my subconscious, the doorbell rang again. Bam, just like that my breakthrough vanished.

We only stayed less than an hour because we headed for the nearby waterfalls. Another 30 minutes of trekking. But the trip was worth it because the falls looked serene and the whole scene is indeed breathtaking. It's like you can hear yourself being one with nature. Soaking myself in the cold water was like communing with mother earth. The cold air and water were enough to make you be lulled to sleep."

By Gary Fineout and Alfonso Chardy, the citizenship ceremony in Jacksonville seemed to proceed as usual, with a crowd of nearly 200 people going home as new Americans. Just before the new citizens left the June 29 event, an immigration official directing the swearing-in urged them to stop by a voter registration table—a not uncommon sight at naturalization ceremonies. But this table was unusual: those handing out forms were Republican volunteers—and the party affiliation box had been checked off ahead of time to make all of the new voters members of the GOP. All of it was suspicious to Linda Cross, who was there to watch her husband, Dario Cruz, take his citizenship oath."

As a non-American blogger I've been a little hesitant to get involved in some of these discussions, particularly the bits about flags, but since I started it (the subject, not the flag-burning) I suppose I'd better say something. Firstly, I think that the idea of having a law against flag-burning is completely absurd. The moment you start granting a symbol - any symbol - that kind of automatic reverence and protection, you've taken a small but important step towards totalitarianism. Symbols are somewhat fickle - they don't a priori represent anything in themselves; it's what they are perceived as meaning or made to represent that's important."

The character development was rather weak. Additionally, I thought the score was poor, and was basically a knock-off of Gladiator.

This allows services to sell unit contingent energy as hourly firm since BPA is supplying reserves for up to 60 minutes. If Grays Harbor Paper notifies RT of a unit derate or outage RT should notify BPA dispatch immediately and adjust the schedule during the next ramp. For example should Grays unit trip as 1333 RT would notify BPA and the sink that across the top of the hour for 1400 the schedule would be taken to zero for the 1400. The bottom line is that 60 minutes is the maximum time BPA will carry the schedule.

Relationship of delivery point and the use of interruptible transport on northwest pipeline. Is the transport upstream or downstream of the delivery point? If downstream, why isn't it being contracted for by eweb. 2. What volume is being sold each day. You use the term dcq and you also mention a 20% tolerance above or below the estimated quantity. Normally there would be no tolerance with a dcq transaction. 3. Is this envisioned to be a requirements transaction. Is the price the same for volumes in excess of the estimated quantity up to an additional 20%."

A game to enjoy with your friends (or frenemies) laughing, talking smack, and dropping game-winning bombs. Wizards of the Coast seems to have forgotten this. If you choose to play with friends, you can't earn gold, and gold is essential. Gold is so important that they have implemented a daily cap, understandable considering gold unlocks everything in-game.

98,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"Being the 3rd installment in the trilogy, I'll get the bad stuff out of the way first. I quite hate prequels as it's technically going backwards in a story and not forwards (this is an issue for every prequel). Granted it offers more storywise. The combat feels sloppy and doesn't feel as sharp as Arkham City managed to make it. As of writing this review (26/10/2013), there is a game-breaking bug that stops a side mission from ever being completed (main story not affected). Some gadgets are placed at a ridiculous hotkey that makes your hand have to travel the whole keyboard to reach it. It might sound like nothing, but during combat it could potentially break your combo."
99,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"They basically fixed Shadow Warrior (2013), i.e. the bossfights are awesome, weapons feel very nice (maybe not as good as D44M's ones, but still solid), enemies aren't too spongy (if you're not too careless with handling elemental and upgrade stuff). The upgrade system is really balanced and once you get around it, it's not too tedious. The elemental stuff and limited ammo softly forces you to use different weapons. Lots of cool unique (being the important word here while comparing SW2 to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Borderlands' formula of 'RNG' weapons) weapons that stay viable through most of the game. The music is great, especially the main theme and of course Stan Bush's stuff."

Why? thats a pure discrimination! and why the game does not tell me that before i create a char and not even then when i reach the skill limit after weeks of playing?!?"
101,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"I think this assassin's creed nailed the mechanics on all fronts (ship battles, sailing, hunting (fish), parkour, etc). I felt much more connected to this character as well. The story starts out extremely rough but does get much better as you play (i think this is true for every ac game personally). Edward was quite the interesting character and so were all the side characters. I felt like all the collectables actually meant something in this ac game that i never got from any of the previous ones and maybe its because i felt like they had a bigger purpose in the game. They definitely were not required but they were fun to get and you got rewarded in a very balanced way."
102,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"While I personally cannot recommend this game, it wasn't absolutely terrible. The gunplay is decent, so long as you have the money to purchase gun parts, which would be my main complaint with this game: it's pay-to-win. If I could get past that, the game would be enjoyable, as the hardsuit is fun to use and HRV is an excellent idea. I'd take this game over any Call of Duty title any day, but its pay-to-win microtransaction format is off-putting for me. If you are alright with this model, then by all means, have fun. But if you're like me and dislike pay-to-win games, just let this one slide; it's not our cup of tea."
103,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"While not perfect, this game has been greatly enjoyable. The save system and possibility of sudden death lead to some frustration. I'm on my first playthrough and I lost my main character around hour 10 of 20ish. Would have really liked a save to reload at that point. I've since picked up a 3rd party mod/save tool to avoid catastrophic failures. Plus the aiming reticle is on the small side and zoom is underpowered. With all that said, it's been a blast. I'm not normally a zombie fan, but the combination of strategy, missions, first-person shooter/beat em up is great. I've been playing it as often as I can get away... Just one more mission, just one more supply run—or I'm running away and want to get safe before shutting the game down."
104,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"An absolutely great strategy game! Having played every single other wargame (European Escalation, and ALB), I have to say this one fits well. The number of units is great. Not sure exactly how many units there are, but there's a ton!!! Graphics are just beautiful, sounds are great, and the gameplay overall is epic. The in-game chat box at the main menu is very entertaining as well, no I am not kidding. However, if anyone thinks this game is 'easy', or if you are new to the strategy genre, it could take you quite some time to get it nailed down. Do not get upset, you will lose a lot of units. Just make sure you plan ahead, always have anti-air, and anti-tank."
105,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"I was negatively biased towards this game before I played it. Wasn't even sure about buying. I dunno, the whole portal gun and portals thing seemed odd to me even though I like science fiction. Boy was I wrong. The jokes and voice acting in this game are phenomenal. Just amazing. It's not cheesy (ok it's sometimes cheesy). And different story characters have all their own sense of humour. Those different characters do really have distinct personalities. And the level design; it's just rad. Btw I never played the first portal game. One of these days, I'm planning to if I can spare the time. I would never have played it if I hadn't played the sequel."
106,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,Ok let's start with the pros(+) and cons(-) then my thoughts on this game. +some of the best characters +good story +lots of content +customisable character ( you can be male or female whatever you like) +you can have a relationship with most of your companions(yes fangirls you can have a love interest) -bad graphics ( i dont think graphics really matter anyway) -weird and awkward love scenes -invisible walls -there's one mission in my opinion was boring but everyone has different tastes -+ um this isnt really bad or good but for those who care your protagonist you made cant talk okay now for my thoughts. I love this game. This game is probably one of the best rpgs or games in general i have ever played.so if you're a rpg fan you probably already have this game.
107,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"Yes, this is a nostalgia trip for thirty-somethings who remember (at least in the UK) watching the ever-irritating Timmy Mallet just for the five-minute Transformers cartoon. The voice actors for Optimus, Megatron, Bumblebee, and many others are back, and instantly recognizable. The distinctive cartoon transformation sound is there. Graphically, the cell-shaded presentation is perfect, and very, very Generation One. But aside from that, it's actually a very fun game. The combat mechanics are extremely well done. Transforming mid-fight is often a necessity, and woven seamlessly into combos, making it quite unlike High Moon's excellent War for/Fall of Cybertron games. Another distinction is the heavy focus on melee combat, but some enemies (e.g. Seekers) require a switch to a ranged blaster."
108,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"So I downloaded the game and played it for a little while, and it was nothing special. I spent more time trying to log in than actually playing the game. There is a bug where it says that there was an update to the terms of service or whatever and whenever you click 'accept' it just pops up again. You have to restart the client for it to work. Now that isn't that bad but why do I need to link my Steam and Gface accounts? They say it is for DLC but why is that even necessary? It is also not reversible so now I know that a company I don't care about has access to my Steam information. Now the game itself is so-so. It is easily recognizable as a COD clone, except somehow they made the gunplay worse... How is that even possible?"

110,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"I experienced no performance issues even at release, and after all these patches it plays really well. Imo, this is a truly great and fun game in truth, although the format may be somewhat annoying (where the free-roam city area repopulates with new enemies every time you progress the story). I particularly enjoyed the 'dual play' segments (where you can play batman + 1 more), and the ability to use the controller for most parts of the game but the mouse and keyboard for the tank combat segments was greatly appreciated. Driving your batmobile around the free-roam city, including when chasing the apc commanders, is actually quite enjoyable once you figure out how to use the brakes to skid around corners (and when you master that, driving around the city is really quite enjoyable!)"
111,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"Damn fine aaa fps shooter - that's the bottom line. It looks, sounds and plays great - excellent fps mechanics, nice story, cool characters, flawless voice acting, and a badass soundtrack. Not for the faint hearted though - some of those cutscenes were pretty darn cruel and vivid. But when a game overall is so great, it's easier to spot the flaws, and here they are as I saw 'em: - no sli support - wtf? I had to put the game away until I upgraded my card, as it ran too poorly on my old dual gpu gtx 590.

Can’t tell you how many times I hear new players ♥♥♥♥♥ and complain about getting killed really fast. Oh god forbid you get shot in the face and ♥♥♥♥ing die. It's not like that doesn’t happen in real life or anything. Edit: ok so I’ve been playing this game for a while now. Thrown all kinds of money at it. One of the best MP games around.

114,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"I'm 2 hours in and am dying from this game. So hilarious. Gameplay is also solid, art design is beautiful, music is surprisingly high quality and fitting, the story/world has me intrigued, and the puzzles are fun. But the best thing about this game beyond all that is the comedy. If you've played any rpg since the dawn of video game rpgs you will laugh at the various jokes, parodies, and references; if you've never played an rpg before then you should still enjoy the game for its humor. If you played final fantasy 7 or x you absolutely need to play this game, without giving too much away... I had to actually stop playing after 2 hours to give my cheeks a break from laughing and smiling so much. What a delight so far."
115,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"I'm really sorry, I try to be supportive of free-to-play games and indie developers, but I really didn't enjoy this game. The description sounded right up my alley, but the execution did nothing for me. I love puzzle and exploration games, but I found this game to be completely unintuitive, and even after looking up how to progress I still simply didn't find the gameplay itself fun. It also completely lacks a pause button, or if it does have one I never found it. Considering that a lot of sequences in the game are timed, this seems like a critical oversight. I also feel like this game is a lot more cut scene than it is gameplay, and I end up just sitting around drumming my fingers a lot."
116,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"This game.... Phew where to even start. It was absolutely beautiful, from story to graphics I was hooked. The story wasn’t just some story but actually felt like I was that person, trying to figure out what came next in the story that my character was telling. Gameplay was great and I learned a lot about myself through this game (mainly my fear of heights which I never had a problem with until the ice caverns). My gut churned the whole time, but I pushed through for uncle Fred! If you guys made a DLC or second game, I would be the first to buy it and recommend it to everyone I know. Thanks to everyone who was involved in making this, you made an absolutely beautiful game."
117,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"Sid Meier's Civilization Beyond Earth is a turn-based game in which you build your civilization toward a certain goal or 'victory'. In previous games you were set on the earth's timeline going through periods like the stone age, medieval age, and the modern age; however, in this game you are set in the future on a mission to colonize a new planet. What I enjoy about this game is 2K took a fresh approach to the game and added some new mechanics such as the affinity system and orbital layer. What I didn’t enjoy was that with these new mechanics the game could be overwhelming at times. What I think could be improved in this game is that they could maybe incorporate some new artwork such as the environment you experience when communicating with another leader."
118,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"Great game! Tons of replayability and very fun zombie survival game! Definitely in my top 5 zombie games ever played. Edit: after playing 60+ hours I can honestly say this is one of the better more ''realistic'' zombie games. It's very much designed like a survival horror as you must save up your ammo, heal your own wounds when you bleed out, take pills when you're infected, etc. Also, I find zombies to feel very natural and well animated for a free-to-play game. P.S.: I would recommend getting 1 or 2 friends to play with, but the community is super friendly and you can usually make friends/talk with the people in the chat or over voice comms."
119,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"02/07/2014 - it's a shame i can't thoroughly recommend/enjoy this game as from the short time i've played it, i know i'd be addicted if it didn't have the following 2 game breakers. No aussie servers - one red bar puts you at a severe disadvantage and creates unbearable lag. Mind you, I played through the offline training mode and it was stuttering/lagging as well (how does that even happen?). Couple that with the poor ping, and it just ruins the game. Everything artifacts like crazy - the menus, backgrounds, training and in-game. I've never had this happen before with this card and thought it might not like my oc. Set my gpu back to stock and sure enough, it didn't make a difference."
120,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"Very late last night I finished this. The story is not very deep or compelling but what makes it stand out is the storytelling. The atmosphere is filled to the brim and the many collectibles do a great job at fleshing it out. I did learn a lot about the world of Batman so it was a little disappointing that so few bosses were in the game. Oh well, there's enough future games to rectify that. The combat is the right amount of challenging but it's more on the easy side. Leveling up Batman wasn't very satisfying. It's the gadgets you upgrade and acquire during the campaign which add for nice new gameplay mechanics. Getting access to previously unreachable places makes for a great sense of progression."
121,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"'To the Moon' is no mere game... Nay, it is a veritable experience, and it was one of the best of my life at that. Think Telltale's The Walking Dead is sad? Hohoho! Well, it's no match for 'To the Moon'! Never before have I been so moved yet fulfilled by something purely fictional. This masterpiece represents the pinnacle of storytelling in my opinion, and the soundtrack is a gorgeously charming and perfect accompaniment. Yes, the controls are a bit finicky and the gameplay is not the strong point, but the story is so fantastic that I did not care one bit. Plus, the humor of the game is great as well and it definitely does not intrude upon the distinguished nature of the story... And the Doctor Who references are endless."
122,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"Bastion is a bloody brilliant game, with a truly great storyline. Set after some calamity occurred, you start to rebuild on the bastion. There's quite a lot of choice in the game, with the option of what to build to give you an advantage, what weapons to use and what power ups to have on those weapons as well as what drinks to use to give you a bonus effect. The art style and music in the game are fantastic, everything looks so colourful at times, who says the apocalypse has to be dull. Best of all, the game has narration based on what you, the player do. So if you end up picking up a weapon then switch it for another in the armoury, the narration would say something about you taking along the new weapon."
123,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"I had originally bought this game in early development, when the only currency was spacebux, and there was no 'tech tree'. This was when the game was great. All of the guns at this point were equally overpowered, so there was no issue with imbalance; everyone could kill everyone at any time. Also, the game used to give you unlimited gun slots and five loadouts. You would think that for a game with 'bajillions of guns', they would at least provide you more than 6 weapon slots and 3 loadouts before you have to pay to get more. At one point, I had about 3 pages worth of guns, and was planning new ideas for more, because personally, that's where I found it fun."
124,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"This game was a surprising gem. One often sees rave reviews of certain products that are frequently misleading. In this case, the reviews reflect the fun of this neat little game. It is an odd mix between a classic 2D platformer and a MOBA, and executes it with style. I found myself enjoying characters that I wouldn't enjoy in other MOBA games. I had expected this trait to continue, but decided to give a melee tank a go anyway. I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome and ended up trying out more as they were unlocked from playing games. The art style and interface are oddly charming. As such, I now use one of the characters as my avatar and a wallpaper from creating a card set for the game."

It's been a while since a game has had that effect on me. The music sets the mood, the sound effects are spot on, and the controls are perfect. I look forward to every combat, and they've optimized combat extremely well. I had my doubts about the naval combat system, but it is so much fun to lay waste to multiple fleets at a time! The only way to lose in this game is to fail to retreat. If the combat looks overwhelming just get outta there, regroup, and counter-assault. Thanks, devs, for an awesome experience!"
126,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"The reboot of the Devil May Cry franchise has brought about many changes for the series, particularly for the series’ protagonist, Dante. While fans of the original games may be upset at the change to their beloved character, it’s certainly for the better; and this new game by Ninja Theory proves it. DmC serves as the perfect point for newcomers to jump into the series. It shows the origins of an arrogant, cynical Dante, and it chronicles his journey from cynicism to selflessness. Throughout, the game weaves a clear, narrative arc for the new Dante, making him a compelling character to follow. The story follows Dante as he’s introduced into the corrupt world he willfully chose to ignore."
127,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"Where do I start with this absolutely beautiful game? Its story is absolutely charming. It has so much detail put into it, and it is a bundle of happiness, bad puns, annoying dogs, and secrets. It is serious when it needs to be, but isn't a stranger to funny moments. The character design is on point, with there being various characters with unique personalities and secrets to them. It stands out from other RPGs because you don't have to kill anyone, which is a rare concept in RPGs. With lots of inspiration from EarthBound, one of the best RPGs I've seen, you can tell that it is going to be good. It easily has the best soundtrack I've heard in forever."

Half the story relies on shock value. I was not shocked nor emotionally moved in any way by this. Maybe I'm desensitized, or maybe it was too simple to warrant a reaction out of me. As for the other half of the game, it tries to paint a picture (literally) of a person in mental decline. It deals with obsession, hallucination, depression and a few other things. In theory it is an interesting idea. But the 'game' took me 10 minutes to complete, and that is with reading and absorbing every little bit of information I could."

It is an amazing way to test your mind while still being fun. Although this game isn't as story-heavy, it did give birth to one of the most **iconic** popular games of 2011. I still play this game and beat it when I am feeling bored and I love to come back and **discover** what gave birth to a legend and what is a legend. Gameplay: Portal's gameplay is quite simple, to explain at least. You use portals to your advantage, along with buttons that activate a part of the puzzle. Two buttons are in the game, one that you press and one that you need a cube to place on."

Divinity: Dragon Commander comes awfully close to these borders of my personal most favourite RTS game. Combine this with a huge risk-like grand strategy mode and there, it hit the spot. I am not (read: try not to be) overly biased due to the fact that this game allows you to turn into a dragon, aiding your troops by supporting, attacking and even commanding unit production, direction and spawning at the very same time. Honestly, I do enjoy the complicated RTS games nowadays. Think of Civ V and so on. However, such games attempt to cram complex mechanics, charts and resources all into one complicated game mode."

And all of this without touching on the world, characters, story, gameplay... I could write whole pages about it. But instead, I'll just say this: if you like rpgs, play this game.

When I played version 1.00 -&gt; 1.03 my game never crashed, I didn't see any bugs. Also I have noticed that after 1.03 patch draw distance sometimes is horrible, starting to render objects when you're really close, sometimes even people. But if forgetting all these bugs, crashes and draw distance 'bugs', this is a fantastic game, they made huge effort on quests, some of them really emotional and deep, lots of side quests, and the fact that your decision affects a lot in this game.

The devs are very active in the community, and it really shows in the various discussion forums and dev diaries. There is a fairly steep learning curve to the game's mechanics, which I am still trying to master; however, this depth of strategy allows you a myriad of ways to reach goals and take advantage of certain situations. The game, in my mind, is almost infinitely replayable. I find myself engrossed in every session I play regardless of how the play-through is going."

After those enjoyable hours, you'll begin to notice that the only thing left the game has to offer is repetition in its combat, enemies, and gameplay. The one major high point for the game is that the developers are working hard and provide semi-frequent updates that generally include a lot of content, from sweeping changes to some of the game's systems, new warframes, and other tweaks or features. It's a good game to play casually. Though I doubt it will hold your attention beyond a few months unless you truly enjoy grinding. The upside to all of this is that the game is free, so I'd recommend trying it out. If you're looking for a quick fix, give it a shot."

Sadly, it's far from it. In this game you go about, absorbing ever bigger things to grow larger and absorb bigger things. But the gameplay isn't as smooth as it could be, the levels not inventive and what is in it is a surreal horror show. I don't mean an entertaining horror show but one that makes you rather depressed and rethink whether being alive is all it should be. Every 'living' creature in this game from small pets to human beings makes me wonder if the creators of this game had an interest in taxidermy."

I thought, 'oh wow! a simulator of the road to becoming president! that sounds fun!' well, it really wasn't. The game starts you off and says you need to pick a side: republican or democrat, there is no independent, or third party. A little disappointed, but still optimistic, I carried on to see what I could do. I will give the game credit, the character customization, although limited, is pretty fun to mess around with.

You don't have to work for power armor—it's basically given to you from the start of the game and power cores are everywhere in trader shops. Value of power armor diminished greatly from previous Fallout games. Story is mediocre, everything about this game is mediocre except it doesn't crash every 10 mins like Fallout 3.

For one thing, I have a Vive and I'm much more interested in playing room-sized games with the controllers. Beyond that, the game is initially awe-inspiring in the scale of its universe, but I also felt that same scale was a hindrance to my enjoyment. The learning curve and the amount of time to do anything interesting at the beginning were both too steep for me. Perhaps if I were more patient and had more time for gaming, this would be compelling to me. But I don't have either, and there are plenty more VR games I'd rather spend my time on."

Single hits to the chest, neck, or head from rifle-caliber weapons almost always result in death unless it just grazes you. Rounds drop over distance, and short, controlled bursts are required if you wish to remain on target. There is no magical ammunition pool. If you reload halfway through your magazine all the time, you will have a pouch full of half-empty mags. You can't run forever. If you sprint for a while, your aim will suffer as you gasp heavily until you have caught your breath. Rest your weapon on your elbows while prone or on a windowsill to steady your aim. Accuracy suffers when standing."

As for XCOM 2, I love it—the game plays quite well for me on medium, and I am running a GTX 560 with 2GB of VRAM. At first the game set it to high and it was running a bit sluggishly but not to the point of being unplayable, but when I dropped it down to medium it smoothed on out.

GM, whose own European operations are losing money, no longer wants to acquire the unprofitable Fiat unit.

The number of women buying programs to protect PCs from viruses, spam and spyware attacks rose by 11.2% each year between 2002 and 2004. The study, for net security firm Preventon, shows that security messages are reaching a diversity of surfers. It is thought that 40% of those purchasing home net security programs are retired. For the last three years, that has gone up by an average of 13.2%. But more retired women (53%) were buying security software than retired men.

In addition to coaxing ever larger and more tangible objects into a regime of quantum behavior, this new capability has inspired ideas of using mechanical oscillators in the processing and communication of quantum information and as precision force sensors operating beyond the standard quantum limit. But the effectively linear interaction between motion and light or electricity prevents access to the broader class of quantum states of motion, such as cat states or energy squeezed states. Indeed, early optomechanical proposals noted the possibility to escape this restriction by creating strong quadratic coupling of motion to light. Although there have been experimental demonstrations of quadratically coupled optomechanical systems, these have not yet achieved nonclassical states of motion."

Unfortunately, the evaluations can be manipulated using fake reviews (""spams"") by professional spammers, who have developed increasingly insidious and powerful spamming strategies by adapting to the deployed detectors. Spamming strategies are hard to capture, as they can vary quickly over time, differ across spammers and target products, and more critically, remain unknown in most cases. Furthermore, most existing detectors focus on detection accuracy, which is not well-aligned with the goal of maintaining the trustworthiness of product evaluations. To address these challenges, we formulate a minimax game where the spammers and spam detectors compete with each other on their practical goals that are not solely based on detection accuracy. Nash equilibria of the game lead to stable detectors that are agnostic to any mixed detection strategies."

To ensure high fidelity, we employ the Lewis-Riesenfeld (L-R) method to derive a family of solutions leading to an exact transfer, where the solutions follow a single dynamical mode of the L-R invariant. Among this family, we identify a tracking solution with a single parameter to control simultaneously the fidelity of the transfer, the population of the excited state, and robustness. We define a measure of the robustness of an uh-fidelity transfer as the minimum percentile deviation on the pulse areas at which the infidelity rises above $10^{-4}$. The robustness of our shaped pulses is found superior to that of Gaussian and adiabatically-optimized pulses for moderate pulse areas."

Due to nonconvexity, there exist multiple local minima that are not globally optimal, even when the mixture is well-separated. We demonstrate that all local minima share the same form of structure that partially identifies the component centers of the true mixture, in the sense that each local minimum involves a non-overlapping combination of fitting multiple gaussians to a single true component and fitting a single gaussian to multiple true components. Our results apply to the setting where the true mixture components satisfy a certain separation condition, and hold even when the number of components is over- or under-specified. For gaussian mixtures with three components, we obtain sharper results in terms of the scaling with the separation between the components."

We show that this algorithm can resolve almost exact collisions (i.e., with a mutual separation of a fraction of the physical radius) while using the same time-step as in weakly perturbed problems such as the solar system.

A widely used tool for detecting entanglement is the entanglement witness, where the measurement of the witness operator is guaranteed to be positive for all separable states and can be negative for certain entangled states. In reality, due to the exponentially increasing Hilbert-space dimension with respect to the system size, it is very challenging to construct an efficient entanglement witness for general multipartite entangled states. For $n$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-like states, the most robust witness scheme requires $n+1$ local measurement settings and can tolerate up to $1/2$ white noise. In comparison, the most efficient witness for GHZ-like states only needs two local measurement settings and can tolerate up to $1/3$ white noise."
208,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"Within general relativity, the unique stationary solution of an isolated black hole is the Kerr spacetime, which has a distinct multipolar structure depending only on its mass and spin. We develop a general method to extract the multipole moments of arbitrary stationary spacetimes and apply it to a broad family of horizonless microstate geometries. The latter can break the axial and equatorial symmetry of the Kerr metric and have a far richer multipolar structure, which provides a portal to constrain fuzzball models phenomenologically. We find numerical evidence that all multipole moments are typically larger (in absolute value) than those of a Kerr black hole with the same mass and spin. Current measurements of the quadrupole moment of black-hole candidates could place only mild constraints on fuzzballs, while future gravitational-wave detections of extreme mass-ratio inspirals with the space mission LISA will improve these bounds by orders of magnitude."
209,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"Reasoning about graphs evolving over time is a challenging problem in many domains, such as bioinformatics, physics, and social networks. We consider a common scenario in which edges can be short term interactions (e.g., messaging) or long term structural connections (e.g., friendship). In practice, long term edges are often specified by humans. Human-specified edges can be both costly to produce and suboptimal for the downstream task. To address these issues, we propose a model based on temporal point processes and variational autoencoders that learns to infer temporal attention between nodes by observing node communication. As temporal attention drives between-node feature propagation, using the dynamics of node interactions to learn this key component offers more flexibility while simultaneously avoiding issues associated with human-specified edges."
210,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"Observations of thermally driven transverse vibration of a photonic crystal waveguide (pcw) are reported. The pcw consists of two parallel nanobeams with a 240 nm vacuum gap between them. Models are developed and validated for the transduction of beam motion to phase and amplitude modulation of a weak optical probe propagating in a guided mode (gm) of the pcw for probe frequencies far from and near to the dielectric band edge. Since our pcw has been designed for near-field atom trapping, this research provides a foundation for evaluating potential deleterious effects of thermal motion on optical atomic traps near the surfaces of pcws. Longer term goals are to achieve strong atom-mediated links between individual phonons of vibration and single photons propagating in the gms of the pcw, thereby enabling opto-mechanics at the quantum level with atoms, photons, and phonons."
211,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"We establish natural splittings for the values of global Mackey functors at orthogonal, unitary and symplectic groups. In particular, the restriction homomorphisms between the orthogonal, unitary and symplectic groups of adjacent dimensions are naturally split epimorphisms. The interest in these splittings comes from equivariant stable homotopy theory. The equivariant stable homotopy groups of every global spectrum form a global Mackey functor, so the splittings imply that certain long exact homotopy group sequences split into short exact sequences. For the real and complex global Thom spectra $\mathbf{mo}$ and $\mathbf{mu}$, the splittings imply the regularity of various Euler classes related to the tautological representations of $o(n)$ and $u(n)$."
212,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"Baryonic feedback effects lead to a suppression of the weak lensing angular power spectrum on small scales. The poorly constrained shape and amplitude of this suppression is a significant source of uncertainties for upcoming cosmological weak lensing surveys such as Euclid or LSST. In this first paper in a series of two, we use simulations to construct a Euclid-like tomographic mock data-set for the cosmic shear power spectrum and the corresponding covariance matrix, which are both corrected for baryonic effects following the baryonification method of Schneider et al. (2019). In addition, we develop an emulator to obtain rapid predictions of the baryonic power suppression, enabling us to perform a likelihood inference analysis for a standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with both cosmological and astrophysical parameters."
213,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"Spontaneous conversations in real-world settings such as those found in child-centered recordings have been shown to be among the most challenging audio files to process. Nevertheless, building speech processing models capable of handling such a wide variety of conditions would be particularly useful for language acquisition studies in which researchers are interested in the quantity and quality of the speech that children hear and produce, as well as for early diagnosis and measuring effects of remediation. In this paper, we present our approach to designing an open-source neural network to classify audio segments into vocalizations produced by the child wearing the recording device, vocalizations produced by other children, adult male speech, and adult female speech. To this end, we gathered diverse child-centered corpora which amount to a total of 260 hours of recordings and cover 10 languages."
214,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"Density-based clustering relies on the idea of linking groups to certain specific features of the probability distribution underlying the data. The reference to a true, yet unknown, population structure allows us to frame the clustering problem in a standard inferential setting, where the concept of ideal population clustering is defined as the partition induced by the true density function. The nonparametric formulation of this approach, known as modal clustering, establishes a correspondence between the groups and the domains of attraction of the density modes. Operationally, a nonparametric density estimate is required and a proper selection of the amount of smoothing, governing the shape of the density and thus possibly the modal structure, is crucial to identify the final partition. In this work, we address the issue of density estimation for modal clustering from an asymptotic perspective."
215,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"The tails of diboson production at the LHC are sensitive to the interference between Standard Model and higher-dimension operators parameterizing the effects of heavy new physics. However, helicity selection rules for the diboson scattering amplitudes set an obstruction to the na\""ive interference contributions of dimension-six operators, causing the total diboson rate correction's leading contribution to cancel. In this case, carefully measuring the azimuthal decay angles ""resurrects"" the interference, restoring sensitivity to the ""non-interfering"" operators. We explore these signatures in detail, and find that the EFT uncertainties associated with higher-dimensional operators are uniquely well-suppressed by the construction of an asymmetry variable which is only generated by these non-interfering operators, relegating the effects of higher-dimensional, interfering operators to the same status as statistical errors in this observable."
216,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"Causal inference from observational data is the goal of many data analyses in the health and social sciences. However, academic statistics has often frowned upon data analyses with a causal objective. The emergence of the term 'data science' provides a historic opportunity to redefine data analysis in such a way that it naturally accommodates causal inference from observational data. Like others before, we categorize the scientific contributions of data science into three classes of tasks: description, prediction, and counterfactual prediction (which includes causal inference). An explicit classification of data science tasks is essential to discuss the data, assumptions, and analytics required to successfully accomplish each task. We argue that a failure to adequately describe the role of subject-matter expert knowledge in data analysis is a source of widespread misunderstandings about data science."
217,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"The weak gravity conjecture (WGC) demands the existence of superextremal particles in any consistent quantum theory of gravity. The standard lore is that these particles are introduced to ensure that extremal black holes are either unstable or marginally stable, but it is not clear what is wrong if this doesn't happen. This note shows that, for a generic Einstein quantum theory of gravity in AdS, exact stability of extremal black branes is in tension with rigorously proven quantum information theorems about entanglement entropy. Avoiding the contradiction leads to a nonperturbative version of the WGC, which reduces to the usual statement at weak coupling. The argument is general, and it does not rely on either supersymmetry or a particular UV completion, assuming only the validity of Einsteinian gravity, effective field theory, and holography."
218,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"Understanding how strongly correlated two-dimensional (2D) systems can give rise to unconventional superconductivity with high critical temperatures remains one of the major unsolved problems in condensed matter physics. Ultracold 2D Fermi gases have emerged as clean and controllable model systems to study the interplay of strong correlations and reduced dimensionality, but direct evidence of superfluidity in these systems has been lacking. Here, we demonstrate superfluidity in an ultracold 2D Fermi gas by moving a periodic potential through the system and observing no dissipation below a critical velocity v$_{\rm c}$. We measure v$_{\rm c}$ as a function of interaction strength and find a maximum in the crossover regime between bosonic and fermionic superfluidity. Our results establish ultracold Fermi gases as a powerful tool for studying the influence of reduced dimensionality on strongly correlated superfluids."
219,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"Ordinary differential equation (ODE) is a mathematical model used in many application areas such as climatology, bioinformatics, and chemical engineering due to its intuitive appeal for modeling. Despite ODE's wide usage in modeling, frequent absence of their analytic solutions makes it challenging to estimate ODE parameters from the data, especially when the model has many variables and parameters. This paper proposes a Bayesian ODE parameter estimation algorithm which is fast and accurate even for models with numerous parameters. The proposed method approximates an ODE model with a state-space model based on equations of a numeric solver. It enables fast estimation by avoiding computations of a whole numerical solution in the likelihood. The posterior is obtained by a variational Bayes method, more specifically, the approximate Riemannian conjugate gradient method (Honkela et al."
220,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"We study the transport properties and superconducting proximity effect in nsn junctions formed by a time-reversal symmetry broken Weyl semimetal (WSM) in proximity to an $s$-wave superconductor. We find that the differential conductance and induced pairing amplitudes strongly depend on the angle between the junction direction in real space and the axis separating the Weyl nodes in momentum space. We identify the influence of a chiral chemical potential, i.e., the electron population imbalance between Weyl nodes of opposite chirality, on the transport characteristics of the junction. Notably, we observe a net spin polarization of Cooper pairs that are generated via Andreev reflection in the two WSM regions. The spin polarization is opposite in the two WSM regions and highly sensitive to the chirality imbalance and excitation energy."
221,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"Metal ion implantation into ceramics has been demonstrated to be an effective and controllable technique for modifying the surface electrical conductivity of the ceramic piece, and this approach has been used in numerous applications. Importantly, it provides a method for grading the voltage drop across high voltage insulators, thereby increasing the maximum operational voltage that can be applied across the insulator without surface flashover. However, a concern regarding the use of this method is the long-term stability of the implantation-induced conductivity, particularly if the implanted metal species is easily oxidized. Here we report on our investigation of the long-term behavior of the surface conductivity of titanium-implanted alumina. The results indicate that after an initial drop of as much as 40% in the first few weeks after implantation, the conductivity exhibits only a very slow decrease of about 10% over the following year."
222,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"We introduce a novel skyrme-like conserved current in the effective theory of pions and vector mesons based on the concept of hidden local symmetry. The associated charge is equivalent to the skyrmion charge for any smooth configuration. In addition, there exist singular configurations that can be identified as n_f=1 baryons charged under the new symmetry. Under this identification, the vector mesons act as the chern-simons vector fields living on the quantum hall droplet that forms the n_f=1 baryon. We propose that this current is the correct effective expression for the baryon current at low energies. This proposal provides a unified picture for the two types of baryons and allows them to continuously transform one to the other in a natural way. Moreover, chern-simons dualities on the droplet can be interpreted as a result of seiberg-like duality between gluons and vector mesons."
223,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"Interfacial spin-orbit coupling in Josephson junctions offers an intriguing way to combine anomalous Hall and Josephson physics in a single device. We study theoretically how the superposition of both effects influences superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator/superconductor junctions' transport properties. Transverse momentum-dependent skew tunneling of Cooper pairs through the spin-active ferromagnetic insulator interface generates sizable transverse Hall supercurrents, which we refer to as anomalous Josephson Hall effect currents. We generalize the Furusaki-Tsukada formula, initially developed to quantify conventional (tunneling) Josephson current flows, to evaluate the transverse current components and demonstrate that their amplitudes are highly adjustable by means of the spin-orbit coupling strengths or the superconducting phase difference across the junction. As a clear spectroscopic fingerprint of Josephson junctions, well-localized subgap bound states form around the interface."
224,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"Following the suggestion from the Monte-Carlo experiments in Jiménez (J. of Turbul. 2020), that dipoles are as important to the dynamics of decaying two-dimensional turbulence as individual vortex cores, it is found that the kinetic energy of this flow is carried by elongated streams formed by the merging of dipoles. Vortices separate into a group of small fast-moving cores, and another group of larger slowly moving ones, which can be described as ‘frozen’ into a slowly evolving ‘crystal’. The kinematics of both groups are very different, and only the former is self-similar. The latter is responsible for most of the kinetic energy of the flow, and its vortices form the dipoles and the streams. Mechanisms are discussed for the growth of this slow component."
225,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"Continuous-time quantum walks have proven to be an extremely useful framework for the design of several quantum algorithms. Often, the running time of quantum algorithms in this framework is characterized by the quantum hitting time: the time required for the quantum walk to find a vertex of interest with high probability. In this article, we provide improved upper bounds for the quantum hitting time that can be applied to several ctqw-based quantum algorithms. In particular, we apply our techniques to the glued-trees problem, improving its hitting time upper bound by a polynomial factor: from $o(n^5)$ to $o(n^2\log n)$. Furthermore, our methods also help to exponentially improve the dependence on precision of the continuous-time quantum walk based algorithm to find a marked node on any ergodic, reversible Markov chain by Chakraborty et al."

Dry (or the ""loss-cone"") emris, previously considered as the main emri sources for the laser interferometer space antenna, are primarily produced by multi-body scattering in the nuclear star cluster and gravitational capture. In this letter, we highlight an alternative emri formation channel: (wet) emri formation assisted by the accretion flow around accreting galactic-center massive black holes (mbhs). In this channel, the accretion disk captures stellar-mass black holes that are initially moving on inclined orbits, and subsequently drives them to migrate towards the mbh - this process boosts the formation rate of emris in such galaxies by orders of magnitude."

Under such circumstances, we still expect our recommender systems could attract the users at the first time so that they decide to stay on the website and become active users. This problem falls into the new user cold-start category and it is crucial to the development and even survival of a company. Existing works on user cold-start recommendation either require additional user efforts, e.g. setting up an interview process, or make use of side information [10] such as user demographics, locations, social relations, etc. However, users may not be willing to take the interview and side information on cold-start users is often not available."
228,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"Deep learning has solved many problems that are beyond the reach of heuristic algorithms. It has also been successfully applied in wireless communications, even though the current radio systems are well-understood and optimal algorithms exist for many tasks. While some gains have been obtained by learning individual parts of a receiver, a better approach is to jointly learn the entire receiver. This, however, often results in a challenging nonlinear problem, for which the optimal solution is impractical to implement. To this end, we propose a deep fully convolutional neural network, deeprx, which executes the whole receiver pipeline from frequency domain signal stream to uncoded bits in a 5g-compliant fashion. We facilitate accurate channel estimation by constructing the input of the convolutional neural network in a very specific manner using both the data and pilot symbols."
229,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"Mutation-based fuzzing typically uses an initial set of non-crashing seed inputs (a corpus) from which to generate new inputs by mutation. A corpus of potential seeds will often contain thousands of similar inputs. This lack of diversity can lead to wasted fuzzing effort by excessive mutation from all available seeds. To address this, fuzzers include distillation tools (e.g., afl-cmin) that select the smallest subset of seeds that triggers the same range of instrumentation data points as the full corpus. Common practice suggests that minimizing the number and cumulative size of the seeds leads to more efficient fuzzing, which we examine systematically. We present results of 34+ cpu-years of fuzzing with five distillation approaches to understand their impact in finding bugs in real-world software."
230,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"In this paper we investigate multi-agent discrete-event systems with partial observation. The agents can be divided into several groups in each of which the agents have similar (isomorphic) state transition structures, and thus can be relabeled into the same template. Based on the template, a scalable supervisor whose state size and computational cost are independent of the number of agents is designed for the case of partial observation. The scalable supervisor under partial observation does not need to be recalculated regardless of how many agents are added to or removed from the system. We generalize our earlier results to partial observation by proposing sufficient conditions for safety and maximal permissiveness of the scalable least restrictive supervisor on the template level. An example is provided to demonstrate the proposed scalable supervisory synthesis."
231,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"Electric network frequency (ENF) fluctuations constitute a powerful tool in multimedia forensics. An efficient approach for ENF estimation is introduced with temporal windowing based on the filter-bank Capon spectral estimator. A form of Gohberg-Semencul factorization of the model covariance matrix is used due to the Toeplitz structure of the covariance matrix. Moreover, this approach uses, for the first time in the field of ENF, a temporal window, not necessarily the rectangular one, at the stage preceding spectral estimation. Krylov matrices are employed for fast implementation of matrix inversions. The proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in ENF estimation when a short time window of $1$ second is employed in power recordings. In speech recordings, the proposed approach yields highly accurate results with respect to both time complexity and accuracy."

The package also includes a set of classical and robust pre-processing utilities, featuring generalized spatial signs, as well as dedicated plotting functionality and cross-validation utilities.

233,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"The nonlinear fluorescence emission has been widely applied for high spatial resolution optical imaging. Here, we studied the fluorescence anomalous saturating effect of the nitrogen vacancy defect in diamond. The fluorescence reduction was observed under high power laser excitation. It increased the nonlinearity of the fluorescence emission and altered the spatial frequency distribution of the fluorescence image. We used a differential excitation protocol to extract the high spatial frequency information. By modulating the excitation laser's power, the spatial resolution of imaging was improved approximately 1.6 times in comparison with confocal microscopy. Due to the simplicity of the experimental setup and data processing, we expect this method can be used for improving the spatial resolution of sensing and biological labeling with defects in solids."
234,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"When random effects are correlated with sample design variables, the usual approach of employing individual survey weights (constructed to be inversely proportional to the unit survey inclusion probabilities) to form a pseudo-likelihood no longer yields asymptotically unbiased inference. We develop a weight-exponentiated formulation for the random effects distribution that achieves unbiased inference for generating hyperparameters of the random effects. We contrast our approach with frequentist methods that rely on numerical integration to show that only the Bayesian method achieves both unbiased estimation with respect to the sampling design distribution and consistency with respect to the population generating distribution. Our simulations and real data example for a survey of business establishments demonstrate the utility of our approach across different modeling formulations and sampling designs. This work serves as a capstone for recent developmental efforts that combine traditional survey estimation approaches with the Bayesian modeling paradigm and provides a bridge across the two rich but disparate sub-fields."

236,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"Orientational dynamics in the isotropic phase of a comb-shaped nematic polymer with mesogenic and functional side groups was investigated using the Kerr effect and dielectric spectroscopy. For the first time, it was found that in a mesogenic polymer, in contrast to low-molecular-weight mesogens, the relaxation of the electric birefringence of a melt above the temperature of the nematic-isotropic phase transition can be described by a sum of several exponential processes, two of which play a decisive role. These primary processes replace each other in a temperature range of about fifty degrees. Dielectric spectroscopy also revealed two processes of orientational relaxation: the first is due to rotation of the side mesogenic groups, and the second is associated with motion of the main chain segments."
237,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"Deep hashing methods have shown great retrieval accuracy and efficiency in large-scale image retrieval. How to optimize discrete hash bits is always the focus in deep hashing methods. A common strategy in these methods is to adopt an activation function, e.g. $\operatorname{sigmoid}(\cdot)$ or $\operatorname{tanh}(\cdot)$, and minimize a quantization loss to approximate discrete values. However, this paradigm may cause more and more hash bits to become stuck in the wrong saturated area of the activation functions and never escape. We call this problem ""dead bits problem~(dbp)"". Besides, the existing quantization loss will aggravate dbp as well. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective gradient amplifier which acts before activation functions to alleviate dbp."

The former is constrained by disappearing charged track searches at the LHC and by dark matter direct detection experiments, while the latter is constrained by existing multilepton collider searches. We find that a two-step electroweak phase transition involving a stable triplet with a negative quadratic term is ruled out by direct detection searches, while an unstable triplet with a mass less than $230\ \mathrm{GeV}$ is excluded at $95\%$ confidence level."

The standard scenario posits an initially circular and narrow belt of planetesimals at semi-major axis $a$, whose eccentricity is increased to $e_f$ after the gas disc has dispersed by secular perturbations from an eccentric planet, resulting in a belt of width $2ae_f$. In a minor modification of this scenario, narrower belts can arise if the planetesimals are initially eccentric, which could result from earlier planet perturbations during the gas-rich protoplanetary disc phase. However, a primordial eccentricity could alternatively be caused by instabilities that increase the disc eccentricity, without the need for any planets."

Here, we report measurements of many-body modes in 1D gated wires using a tunnelling spectroscopy technique. We observe two separate Fermi seas at high energies, associated with spin and charge excitations, together with the emergence of three additional 1D 'replica' modes that strengthen with decreasing wire length.

In this paper, we identify a surprising consequence of popularity-based rankings: the fewer the items reporting a given signal, the larger the share of the overall traffic they collectively attract. This few-get-richer effect emerges in settings where there are few distinct categories of items (e.g., left-leaning news sources versus right-leaning news sources), and items are ranked based on their popularity. We demonstrate analytically that the few-get-richer effect arises when people tend to click on top-ranked items and have diverse preferences for the classes of items. Using simulations, we examine how the strength of the effect changes with assumptions about the setting and human behavior. We also test our predictions experimentally in an online study with human participants. Our findings have important implications for understanding the spread of misinformation."
245,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"Weight pruning has been widely acknowledged as a straightforward and effective method to eliminate redundancy in deep neural networks (DNNs), thereby achieving acceleration on various platforms. However, most pruning techniques are essentially trade-offs between model accuracy and regularity which lead to impaired inference accuracy and limited on-device acceleration performance. To solve this problem, we introduce a new sparsity dimension, namely pattern-based sparsity that comprises pattern and connectivity sparsity, and becomes both highly accurate and hardware friendly. With carefully designed patterns, the proposed pruning method consistently achieves accuracy enhancement and better feature extraction ability on different DNN structures and datasets, and our pattern-aware pruning framework also achieves pattern library extraction, pattern selection, pattern and connectivity pruning and weight training simultaneously. Our approach on the new pattern-based sparsity naturally fits into compiler optimization for highly efficient DNN execution on mobile platforms."

We study the effect of mountaintop removal mining (mrm) on mortality using a difference-in-differences analysis that leverages the increase in mrm following the 1990 clean air act amendments. For a difference-in-differences analysis of the effect of mrm on mortality, we constructed a more closely matched control group and found a 95\% confidence interval that includes substantial adverse effects along with no effect and small beneficial effects."

[The way we work], around 15 percent of American workers don't have traditional full-time jobs. They're half-time, part-time, contract workers or temps. The term 'side hustle' perfectly fits with this ethos where people are putting together a few different things to make a living. The word 'side hustle' has its roots in popular African American newspapers. In the 1920s, these papers used the word 'hustle' to refer to some kind of scam. By the 1950s, they were using 'side hustle' to describe legitimate work, too. A side hustle is a little different than a second job. A second job is about necessity."

One is synthetic, the other organic. One is imposed on the environment, the other shapes it. One is designed for nature, the other is designed by her. Michelangelo said that when he looked at raw marble, he saw a figure struggling to be free. The chisel was Michelangelo's only tool. But living things are not carved. They grow. And in our smallest units of life, our cells, we carry all the information that's required for every other cell to function and to replicate. Tools also have consequences. At least since the industrial revolution, the world of design has been dominated by the rigors of manufacturing and mass production."

Like it's this trick that's supposed to make you feel better. But I was thinking — picturing all of you naked in 2018 feels kind of weird and wrong. Like, we're working really hard on moving past stuff like that, so we need a new way of dealing with nervousness onstage. And I realized that what I'd really like is to look at you as much as you're looking at me — just to even things out a little bit.

I want to know how they rely on the water's bounty for their livelihood. Understanding all of this enables us to shift our perception of seafood away from a commodity to an opportunity to restore our ecosystem. It allows us to celebrate the seafood that we're also so fortunate to eat. So what do we call this? I think we call it restorative seafood.

Now, the Yap don't actually move these rai stones around or exchange them the way we do with our coins, because rai stones can get to be quite massive.

If you insist that you’re innocent anyway, you’ll likely be found guilty and executed. But if you confess, apologize, and implicate others for good measure, you’ll go free. Do you give a false confession—or risk a public hanging? This was the dilemma facing those accused of witchcraft in the village of Salem, Massachusetts, between February 1692 and May 1693. They were the victims of paranoia about the supernatural, misdirected religious fervor—and a justice system that valued repentance over truth. Salem was settled in 1626 by Puritans, a group of English Protestants. Life was strict and isolated for the people of Salem. Battles with their Native American neighbors and groups of French settlers were commonplace."

Unfortunately, there aren’t nearly enough donor organs available to meet that demand. What if instead of waiting, we could create brand-new, customized organs from scratch? That’s the idea behind bioprinting, a branch of regenerative medicine currently under development. We’re not able to print complex organs just yet, but simpler tissues including blood vessels and tubes responsible for nutrient and waste exchange are already within our grasp. Bioprinting is a biological cousin of 3-D printing, a technique that deposits layers of material on top of each other to construct a three-dimensional object one slice at a time."

On top of that, those are the places from where trouble comes. So we have an ironic problem — good teachers don't want to go to just those places where they're needed the most.

And I ask my students these two questions, and then I share how I answer them, which is in these three sentences that go: I am the daughter of Black writers, who are descended from freedom fighters who broke their chains and changed the world.

Sputnik was actually not the first piece of human technology to enter space. That distinction goes to the V-2 rocket used by Germany in missile attacks against Allied cities as a last-ditch effort in the final years of World War II.

Essentially, the company was developing a medical device where you could run your entire blood panel on a finger-stick of blood.

In the center of this cloud, our sun formed and ignited. Along with that, what we now know as planets, comets and asteroids formed. What then happened, according to theory, is that when the earth had cooled down a bit after its formation, comets massively impacted the earth and delivered water to it.

Roosevelt famously loved the outdoors, but Muir had invited him there for more than just camping: Yosemite was in danger. Though Yosemite became protected land in 1864, the valley was still at risk of overdevelopment in 1903. It was at the heart of a decades-long struggle to set aside land for both preservation and public use—two goals that were much easier said than done.

Carbon works in a natural cycle, present in all living things: in the soil, in the oceans, in the atmosphere and in rocks deep underground. When plants and other living things die, much of their stored carbon makes its way back to the atmosphere until new plants grow and reabsorb the carbon. But over millions of years, some of the carbon stored in ancient trees and sea life turns into rock and some becomes fossil fuels: coal, oil and natural gas. Natural events like volcanic eruptions release some of the carbon trapped in rock. And human activities, like burning fossil fuels, also release some of that prehistoric carbon. Today, humans emit around 60 times more carbon than all the volcanoes on the planet each year."

Yet one of the greatest differences between natural and human technologies relates to robustness. Robust systems are stable in complex and new environments. Remarkably, cockroaches can self-stabilize while running over rough terrain. When we attach a jet pack to them, or introduce a perturbation like an earthquake, we discovered that their wonderfully tuned legs allow them to self-stabilize without using any of their brainpower. They can traverse complex terrain like grass, no problem, and not get destabilized. We discovered a new behavior where, because of their shape, they actually roll automatically to their side to go through this artificial test patch of grass. Robust systems can perform multiple tasks with the same structure. Here's a new behavior we've discovered."

294,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,speech,"What do you think when you look at me? A woman of faith? An expert? Maybe even a sister. Or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist. Or just an airport security line delay. That one's actually true. (laughter) If some of your perceptions were negative, I don't really blame you. That's just how the media has been portraying people who look like me. One study found that 80 percent of news coverage about Islam and Muslims is negative. And studies show that Americans say most don't know a Muslim. I guess people don't talk to their Uber drivers. (laughter) Well, for those of you who have never met a Muslim, it's great to meet you."
295,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,speech,"We need to build a weather service for water. Yet, until we collectively demand accountability, the incentives to fund it will not exist. The first time I spoke at a conference was here at TED, eight years ago. Fresh out of grad school, little did I know that in those few minutes onstage, I was framing the questions I would be asked for the next decade. And, like too many 20-somethings, I expected to solve the world's problems — more specifically, the world's water problems — with my technology. I had a lot to learn. It was seductive, believing that our biggest water quality problems persist because they're so hard to identify. And I presumed that we just needed simpler, faster, and more affordable sensors. I was wrong."
296,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,speech,"Indeed, for 20 years, I worked in finance. I knew everything about finance, for sure. I understood the global economy because it was my life. All the topics that you could bring up about ecology, the end of the world, etc., that I knew like the back of my hand—I didn't really believe in them. In 2007, an extremely unusual event occurred; you may remember, the subprime crisis, the collapse of major American banks. It was an electric shock. I had a fair few stormy conversations with my wife about the matter, about my job, on the limits of the model. Besides the crisis, I realized that I was completely wrong, that we were heading for disaster."
297,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,speech,"So, I'll be speaking to you using language... because I can. This is one of these magical abilities that we humans have. We can transmit really complicated thoughts to one another. So what I'm doing right now is, I'm making sounds with my mouth as I'm exhaling. I'm making tones and hisses and puffs, and those are creating vibrations in the air. Those air vibrations are traveling to you, they're hitting your eardrums, and then your brain takes those vibrations from your eardrums and transforms them into thoughts. I hope. (laughter) I hope that's happening. So because of this ability, we humans are able to transmit our ideas across vast reaches of space and time. We're able to share knowledge across minds."
298,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,speech,"There's this quote by activist and punk rock musician Jello Biafra that I love. He says, 'Don't hate the media. Be the media.' I'm an artist. I like working with media and technology because a, I'm familiar with them and I like the power they hold. And b, I hate them and I'm terrified of the power they hold. (Laughter) I remember watching, in 2003, an interview between Fox News host Tony Snow and then-US Defense Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld. They were discussing the recent invasion of Iraq, and Rumsfeld is asked the question, 'Well, we hear about our body counts, but we never hear about theirs, why?' And Rumsfeld's answer is, 'Well, we don't do body counts on other people.'"

It’s 1988, and scientist James Hansen has just testified to the United States Congress that global warming trends are caused by human activity, and will pose an increasing threat to humanity in the future. Well, well. That’s unusually prescient for a human. Looking for a wedding dress? Try a fresh take on a timeless classic. It’s sleek, flattering and modest—just like the traditional dress. Commercials. Could anything be more insufferable? It’s 1997, and the United States Senate has called a hearing about global warming. Some expert witnesses point out that past periods in Earth’s history were warmer than the 20th century."
300,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,speech,"Someone once said that politics is, of course, ""showbiz for ugly people."" So, on that basis, I feel like I've truly arrived. The other thing to consider is what an honor it is, as a politician, to give a TED Talk, particularly here in the U.K., where the reputation of politics, with the expenses scandal, has sunk so low. There was even a story recently that scientists had thought about actually replacing rats in their experiments with politicians. And someone asked, ""Why?"" and they said, ""Well, there's no shortage of politicians, no one really minds what happens to them and, after all, there are some things that rats just won't do."" (Laughter) Now, I know you all love data, so I'm starting with a data-rich slide."
