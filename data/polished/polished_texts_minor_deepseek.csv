1,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Another week just flew by. I drove by the new house yesterday, and the front window was covered in boxes. We may get the keys at closing—I'm getting so excited. If all goes well this week, we'll be set for closing a week from Wednesday. I was up until after 3:00 AM last night watching movies with Bethany. There's been a lot of movie-watching going on around here lately. Here's my rundown: last night we watched *Thirteen*, a movie every mother of a teen should see. It was better than I expected. Then we watched *Gigli*—yeah, it was just as bad as the media said, but we had to see for ourselves."
2,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Summer TV used to be a dead zone full of repeats or something. But now there are two great new shows on TV, and I’ve been watching both religiously for the last week. *Blow Out*—the gayest concept ever that seemingly has zero gay people in sight. Hairstylist Jonathan Antin wants to build a second location for his incredibly popular West Hollywood salon, this time in Beverly Hills. Normally, no one would care—certainly not me—but as I was flipping through the channels, I caught a glimpse of Jonathan, equally narcissistic and dull, looking at an empty space on Rodeo Dr., declaring (in a public voice), 'I am going to build here the greatest salon in the history of the world—ever!' And I was hooked. Not since Rocco have I found such a moron compelling to watch."
3,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"What a week... My right shoulder has tendonitis. It's right under my shoulder blade, so when I move my arm too much—mainly while using a mouse on the computer—it kills me. I can't move it much now because I was on a spree updating my website and working on other online things. I can barely muster the strength to draw anything. Lack of sleep adds to my pain. I'm not too happy right now, but I'll get better.  

My mom's surgery went okay. Her eyesight has come back somewhat—she can see fuzzy shapes and make out colors. Other than that, she's still blind as all sin. Hopefully, she'll fully regain her vision soon."
4,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Kindness of strangers... Attempted laundry today with the kids in tow and realized how quickly the simplest things can become a freaking ordeal. I also learned how remarkably sweet total strangers can be for no reason other than because they feel like being kind. Trust me, it wasn’t like they were trying to get into my pants or anything. I had kid drool all over me and was wearing my 'wash-day' outfit... Also, I’m not super sure I’ll ever be bathing again, so it’s not like there was even an olfactory incentive there! I am doing two things right now: composing a post and watching the collected No Doubt videos. I’m doing both of these while sitting at my desk in my room."
5,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"It's 11:14 PM MST, and here I sit in my bedroom fixing the personal computer of the personnel director from my job. Not that I mind doing it, but I sometimes wonder how often I end up fixing someone else's computer as a favor. I'm glad to be able to love and help people this way, but where do you draw the line between helping and being taken advantage of? The last couple of weeks, I've been staying up late reading and such, so I was looking forward to going to bed early—until I realized it would be more practical to get this computer out of my bedroom and back to its owner. *Laugh* No rest for the weary, right? So I found myself watching *Joe Schmo 2* again tonight."
6,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Remind me, what did I write about before this? Or, a continuation in the 'Is this a date?' saga. So, after the weird lunch, my confidence was shaken. I forgot to tell you guys an important piece of the story. Before Pat shows up to lunch, Dustin starts talking about what a nice guy Pat is and how he's trying to find a girlfriend for him. I'm listening and nodding, realizing that we're talking more about finding Dustin's best friend a girl than discussing whatever it is you talk about with a stranger over pink lemonade. I excused myself to the bathroom, looked in the mirror, and silently asked myself: Am I being pawned off to the other guy? Is this what happens now?"
7,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"I’d like everyone to think before they act. Actually, I’d like each and every single person in the world to think before they get out of bed in the morning and make a commitment to keep thinking all day. And if they’re not prepared to, I’d very much like them to hop right back into bed and drift off into eternal slumber. I’m sick to death of stupid people. No, I’m not the smartest person in the world, but I’m not talking about things that take a lot of brainpower—so I think it’s fair to call out the inanely stupid. Let’s see if I can keep this rant to just a few particular types, and we’ll save some for another day. Sound good? Great."
8,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Two problems with the scenario outlined in my previous post:  

1. True, Bush is stimulating the economy, but in the wrong way. As [Robert Rubin](URL) told NPR's Marketplace today, Bush could have achieved the same stimulus effect without the long-term debt hangover by enacting different tax cuts—temporary ones that would benefit low- and middle-income individuals. Ah, Robert Rubin. The sound of his name is music to our ears. Quick: name one Bush administration cabinet official on the domestic side with Rubin's gravitas. Still thinking? It’ll come to you...  

2. We can't give the Republicans control only in wartime because they've ingeniously concocted an endless, global ""war on terrorism."

Haven't updated in a while, but not much to say. Went to The Cove to see Supernothing—they were good as usual, got to chill with Tiago. :)  
Saturday: went to work, then out with Joe and Rach. Met up with Steve, Tiago, and Tom. Came home around quarter to 12 and woke up the next morning at quarter to 7 for a meet. Got there a little late, but it's all good. I did my full on floor and didn’t fall, placed second on floor and vault, and third on beam. 29.45 all-around, which isn’t bad since my meets get better as the season goes on."
10,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Do you ever have one of those moments when you start reflecting on life? Like when you're sitting in math class, bored out of your mind, and you wonder what exactly goes on in your brain that makes you understand math? Then you realize you exist, you're in math class, and you question why. Suddenly, it strikes you how amazing existence is—only to then realize how absurd it is that you're spiraling into this random train of thought. Ever had that happen? I hate that.  

You know what else I hate? Block schedules. Who even came up with that idea? Anyone can see that sitting through a two-and-a-half-hour class in any subject is cruel and unusual punishment."

Tonight, Andy beat me by a few small dollars and won the frustrating game—or maybe I let him win on account of him leaving in a few short hours and me wanting him to feel good on his last night here. Well, however the story goes, it can't compare to this Texas-sized headache I have at the moment. I've taken some Aleve, and I must say it's doing the trick. All I need now is some well-deserved R&R.

12,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Well... today's been a long day. We had to drive home from Indiana. I guess I'm gonna have to be a little choosy about what I write because I could really take up a lot of time and space, and I just don't have enough energy. First off, I have to say that camp was awesome—even better than I could have expected. God's been doing so much in my life lately, and it's just amazing. I've sort of turned over a new leaf, I guess, but anyway, back to the beginning. We arrived at the Twiggs' house on Friday evening and stayed until we left for camp on Monday. Most of what we did was go to the fair, church, a parade, Walmart, and watch movies."

I hate that, but I'd rather get it over with than try to schedule it during the first month of my surgery rotation. I'm definitely nervous, scared, jittery, and any other words you can think of for ""hell no, I don't wanna go"" to school. This is going to be a whole new ball game for me. As a perfectionist, I love excelling at everything I do. But starting new things is a bitch. I hate being a pawn (like I told Cassie: ""I'm going to be the only pawn on the chessboard who insists on moving like a knight""), and I hate not knowing what's going on."
14,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Arun Shourie talks about how the present Governor of Uttar Pradesh had warned, as far back as 1996, about the impending threat of the rise of a 'third Islamic state' in the subcontinent. T.V. Rajeswar, the former head of the Intelligence Bureau and the present Governor of Uttar Pradesh, had predicted this dire threat in a series of articles published in *The Hindustan Times* back in 1996. Shourie raises a valid point when he asks: Does the fact that you now know he—and not I, to say nothing of Mr. Advani—wrote all that make the warnings ring true? Or do you conclude that because he wrote in this vein, T.V. Rajeswar is a closet communalist and should not be allowed to continue as Governor of Uttar Pradesh?"

It’s been a long, hard day in the trenches here today, folks—almost no time to write anything for you readers. Still, it’s good to see Tigger (now Akcron) taking up the reins herself, making an appearance, and talking about things. Not much to say otherwise. Yesterday was Shakespeare on the Green—a lovely play, though I had to leave before the closing curtain, which kinda sucked. Hopefully someday I’ll see an entire Shakespeare play. But I digress. Akcron is right about the shower problems—it sucks. As for laughing at her in the shower, you have to admit, the look people get when committing self-torture can be pretty entertaining."
16,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"All of a sudden, for the past two days, I have been overcome with terrible bouts of exhaustion—bone-dead exhaustion. Last evening, I went home and just slept, only waking up when my mother called me around eight thirty. When I woke up, it was completely dark, and since I hadn’t switched the lights on, I couldn’t figure out the time or date for a few seconds—just my mother’s voice in the darkness and me grappling with reality. I wonder why I’m feeling so drained... The weather was nice this morning. It was drizzling when I arrived, though in Calcutta, I hear it’s been raining for the past three days."
17,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Last night was the worst. I threw away the sweater I was knitting. I only had about 14 inches done. I lost probably $10 worth of yarn (it's $8 a skein). But by the time I got to the armholes, there were too many stitches, and the mohair kept knotting itself together as I knitted, so frogging (ripping out rows) didn't work well. The yarn kept breaking. I didn't even swear, which is unusual for me. I just morosely ripped it out while listening to season two of *Sex and the City* (way to go, library!). Eventually, I got sick of it and threw it away. I suppose I could say I learned a lot while trying to make this sweater."
18,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Last night in class, we discussed that week’s assigned reading, *Getting Back into Place: Toward a Renewed Study of the Place-World*, by Edward S. Casey. The first chapter deals with ""implacement,"" and the second with ""displacement."" In the first chapter, Casey makes the distinction that our contemporary world and culture revolve around time as the situating force: we are running out of time, we have saved time, we are just in time. He argues that using place as the center of culture creates a more grounded community. (That is a very rough summary—a disclaimer just in case my professor or any classmate happens to read this post.) So far, this book is the first reading that has grabbed me by the proverbial shoulders."

And while giggling is good, one wonders if we would have ended up on that fire escape drinking beer in the fierce wind had we not eaten them earlier. Finding ourselves in front of a sadly closed bar, we paused to flip through an office-supplies catalogue that had arrived in the mail. Lucky we did. Who could have guessed that within its pages lay the deals of a lifetime? Certainly not me. Here are just a few: buy 36 permanent markers, get a stunt kite. Buy 30 lever arch files, get a barbecue."

Senate Republicans, okay—hands up—who watched the 39-hour judicial nominations wankathon last week? I know I didn’t. Well, okay, I did tune in once or twice. The entire colossal waste of time was perpetrated by Republicans who, pissed off that Democrats wouldn’t roll over and nominate four of Bush’s nutjob justices, were trying to score political points by holding a multi-day cry-fest. Never mind that Democrats have already approved 168 of Bush’s judicial nominees—nooo, that’s not good enough for the power-mad Republicans, who are for some reason laboring under the misapprehension that they have a huge mandate for this kind of nonsense."
21,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"This was a good weekend. I did a lot of God's green leaf, after a long time, I listened to a lot of Nevermore (something I should have started doing much earlier) and read a lot. I finished three books over the weekend—Bruce Sterling's *Heavy Weather*, Larry Niven's *World of Ptavvs*, and Octavia Butler's *Parable of the Sower*. *Heavy Weather* was a good cyberpunk romp through a near-future USA, devastated by global warming and general anarchy. While it was clever, well-paced, and altogether very convincing, I must confess that I failed to come away with any really significant sensations about the story or the characters. Not that both aren't well constructed and vividly etched—it's a good book, but not a great one, I guess."
22,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Because this is the aftermath—the first week back from practicum was a struggle, but it’s only in the second week that the smoke has really started to clear. Post-practicum trauma was a hidden epidemic that is only now coming to light. I was stricken, but the eventual meeting with the course coordinator allowed me to release my burden, and by doing so, I have prevented another person from being stuck with such a pedagogically deficient practicum school. Yesterday (Monday), I bumped into another aggrieved classmate who was quite determined to go to the student due to attend her school in the next practicum and tell him how terrible it would be. I calmed her down and said we should go to the administrator first."
23,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Well, things are incredibly busy here at times...but there's always time for stress-relieving activities. I've found that I really suck at 8-ball and ping pong! Rick (the Canuck) beats me regularly—we have a ping pong table in the front lobby of our building, so there's always time for a ""quick round."" Last night, I participated in an 8-ball tournament over at the Hot Spot (our recreation tent—complete with a popcorn machine, numerous TVs, a jukebox, DVD rentals, a pool table, a dartboard, and the ever-present ping pong table). Anyway, I was doing pretty well throughout my one entire game—until I scratched on the eight ball ;( Still, I had a fairly good time—the most fun was the two Dutch soldiers who joined the tournament."
24,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"Fall 1974: I was attempting, for what felt like the 13th time, to fight my way through the second chapter of my high school algebra book. I was not then—nor am I now—a math person. I hate math. I am math-phobic. You get the picture. So as I struggled to make sense of algebra, the doorbell rang. I put down my book and went to open the door. No one was there. Great. I returned to my studies, and just as I was finding a little glimmer of understanding buried in my subconscious, the doorbell rang again. Bam—just like that, my breakthrough disappeared. I went to the door, and once again, no one was there. Just what a struggling math student needs: an uninvited practical joker."

The new room is bigger and closer to my grade-level team—these are the things I need to consider as I spend hours upon hours preparing my room for this year. Had I known I was going to move before the end of the school year, I would have discarded many of the books and supplies I no longer use. Unfortunately, it all came with me. So this week was spent moving, unpacking, and purging profusely. I have to thank my teammate Jill for helping with all of this. You see, she was still teaching this month in my old room, so she and her lovely students moved almost my entire room for me!"

Forever, I will be reminded of the few nights we spent together, hearts and limbs entwined in a soulful embrace, drenched in the salty darkness of an evening by the beach... Or a kiss under the rain. Whenever I feel the sharp ache of longing piercing my heart, you will be there. That piece of you... bleeding the eternal love that once lived in me... and still remains... For her."

Or let me rephrase that—the article I'm working on and its consequences aren't exactly something I'm comfortable with. Maybe it's because I don't believe in it enough, so I can't fully grasp the passion behind it—the drive to question everything. I grew up in a country where you don't ask questions. Really, you just don't. They shoot you for that. They lock you up under internal security acts. I'm not used to this freedom of speech...not used to questioning things openly.

28,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,blog,"We had an outing yesterday with my coworkers at the bank. We went to Guintubdan, La Carlota. It was the first time for most of us. We trekked to the falls—about a 30-minute walk. We were all catching our breath. Whew! But we made it. The water was icy cold. You could feel your body going numb from the chill. We stayed less than an hour before heading to the nearby waterfalls—another 30 minutes of trekking. But the trip was worth it because the falls looked serene, and the whole scene was truly breathtaking. It felt like you could hear yourself becoming one with nature. Soaking in the cold water was like communing with Mother Earth. The cold air and water were enough to lull you to sleep."

I think it’s starting to sink in for Ed and for all of us. I think it sunk in for me a long time ago. I just hope Ed will be here for Bailey’s surgery.

There's nothing better than seeing the excitement on your child's face. After the egg hunt, we all went to church.

The citizenship ceremony in Jacksonville seemed to go off as usual, with a crowd of nearly 200 people becoming new Americans. Just before the new citizens left the June 29 event, an immigration official directing the swearing-in urged them to stop by a voter registration table—a not uncommon sight at naturalization ceremonies.  

But this table was unusual: those handing out forms were Republican volunteers, and the party affiliation box had been checked off ahead of time, making all the new voters members of the GOP. All of it seemed suspicious to Linda Cross, who was there to watch her husband, Dario Cruz, take his citizenship oath."

Nothing like 48 hours of daydreaming to get one's creative energy back. I have it good for a foreigner, and my timing was good, too. The illustration part is the icing on the cake. I'd probably complain more if that didn't fall in my lap. I know I'm getting ripped off, though. I'm not blind to that fact. Getting hungry.

As a non-American blogger, I've been a little reluctant to get involved in some of these discussions, particularly the parts about flags, but since I started it (the subject, not the flag-burning), I suppose I'd better say something.  

First, I think the idea of having a law against flag-burning is completely nuts. The moment you start granting a symbol—any symbol—that kind of automatic reverence and protection, you've taken a small but important step toward totalitarianism.

Following our discussion yesterday afternoon, Reyna and I reviewed the NSP PowerPac agreement. We specifically looked for language in the agreement that might require us to true up for the customer, regardless of whether we were allocating storage on a given gas day. We couldn't find any language in the current agreement (dated April 1, 2001) that obligates us to true up for them, but we may have overlooked or misinterpreted something."

Re: Loss of Continuity in PX Day-Ahead Auction Due to ISO Rule Changes  

The emergency tariff filing by the California ISO last Friday has negatively impacted the PX day-ahead auction market. The combination of soft and hard caps creates a complete disconnect and unacceptable risk for all participants, and it is unlikely to achieve the ISO’s intended reduction in real-time energy sales and procurement.  

The overall effect will be that supply will continue to defer to the higher realized price opportunity offered by the ISO. The PX is petitioning Terry Winter of the ISO to immediately permit adjustment bids on any submitted schedule at any relevant price."

Beginning immediately, Enron has purchased Control Area Reserves service from BPA. This allows services to sell unit-contingent energy as hourly firm since BPA is supplying reserves for up to 60 minutes.  

If Grays Harbor Paper notifies RT of a unit derate or outage, RT should notify BPA Dispatch immediately and make the reduction in the schedule during the next ramp. For example, should Grays Harbor unit trip at 1333, RT would notify BPA and the sink that across the top of the hour (for 1400), the schedule would be taken to zero for the 1400 hour.  

The bottom line is that 60 minutes is the maximum time BPA will carry the schedule."

2. What volume is being sold daily? You mention DCQ and also refer to a 20% tolerance above or below the estimated quantity. Typically, there would be no tolerance in a DCQ transaction.  

3. Is this intended to be a requirements transaction? Is the price the same for volumes exceeding the estimated quantity, up to an additional 20%?"

As a result, SDG&E customers can expect lower electric bills.  

Assuming the lump sum reimbursement is not included in the implicit energy component, the average from June 2000 through January 2001 is 6.2 cents, while the implicit commodity average from February 2001 through December 2001 is 7.3 cents.

However, this isn’t the end—the order only covers January 2001, with further orders expected for December 2000 and benchmark prices through April 2001. The refund prices were set fairly high ($273/MWh, based on gas prices, emissions costs, and an assumed heat rate exceeding 16,000).

Wizards of the Coast seems to have forgotten this. If you choose to play with friends, you can't earn gold, and gold is essential. It's so important that they've implemented a daily cap, which is understandable since gold unlocks everything in-game.

I quite hate prequels since they technically go backward in a story rather than forward (this is an issue for every prequel). Granted, it offers more story-wise. The combat feels sloppy and not as sharp as Arkham City managed to make it. As of writing this recommendation (26/10/2013), there is a game-breaking bug that stops a side mission from ever being completed (main story unaffected). Some gadgets are placed at a ridiculous hotkey, forcing your hand to travel across the whole keyboard to reach them. It might sound minor, but in combat, it could potentially break your combo."
99,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"They basically fixed *Shadow Warrior* (2013). The boss fights are awesome, weapons feel very nice (maybe not as good as *D44M*'s, but still solid), and enemies aren't too spongy—unless you're careless with handling elemental and upgrade mechanics. The upgrade system is well-balanced and not too tedious once you get the hang of it. The elemental effects and limited ammo gently encourage you to switch between weapons. There are lots of cool, unique weapons (key word here, unlike *Borderlands*' RNG-based formula) that remain viable for most of the game. The music is great, especially the main theme and, of course, Stan Bush's tracks."

Why can’t someone who is 1.74m be as good at shooting as someone who is 1.71m? I’m 1.87m in real life, made my first player with this height, and noticed I couldn’t reach a higher skill than 89. Why? That’s pure discrimination! And why doesn’t the game tell me this before I create a character, or even when I hit the skill limit after weeks of playing?!"
101,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"I think this Assassin's Creed nailed the mechanics on all fronts—ship battles, sailing, fishing, parkour, etc. I also felt much more attached to this character. The story starts out extremely rough but gets much better as you play (I think this is true for every AC game, personally). Edward was quite an interesting character, and so were all the side characters. I felt like all the collectibles actually meant something in this AC game, which I never got from any of the previous ones—maybe because they seemed to have a bigger purpose. They definitely weren’t required, but they were fun to get, and the rewards felt very balanced."
102,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"While I personally cannot recommend this game, it wasn’t absolutely terrible. The gunplay is alright, as long as you have the money to purchase gun parts—which is my main complaint with this game: it’s pay-to-win. If I could get past that, the game would be enjoyable, since the hardsuit is fun to use and HRV is an excellent idea. I’d take this game over any Call of Duty title any day, but its pay-to-win microtransaction format is off-putting for me. If you’re alright with this model, then by all means, have fun. But if you’re like me and dislike pay-to-win games, just let this one slide; it’s not our cup of tea."
103,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"While not perfect, this game has been greatly enjoyable. The save system and possibility of sudden death can lead to some frustration. I'm on my first playthrough and lost my main character around hour 10 of 20. I would have really liked a save to reload at that point. I've since picked up a third-party mod/save tool to avoid catastrophic failures. Plus, the aiming reticle is on the small side, and the zoom is underpowered.  

With all that said, it's been a blast. I'm not normally a zombie fan, but the combination of strategy, missions, and first-person shooter/beat-em-up gameplay is great. I've been playing it as often as I can—just one more mission, just one more supply run, or I'm running away and want to get safe before shutting the game down."
104,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"An absolutely great strategy game! Having played every other wargame (European Escalation and ALB), I have to say this one fits well. The number of units is great—I’m not sure exactly how many there are, but there’s a ton! The graphics are beautiful, the sounds are great, and the gameplay overall is epic. The in-game chat box at the main menu is very entertaining too—no, I’m not kidding. However, if you think this game is 'easy' or if you’re new to the strategy genre, it could take you quite some time to master it. Don’t get upset; you’ll lose a lot of units. Just make sure to plan ahead, always have anti-air, and anti-tank."
105,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"I was negatively biased toward this game before I played it. I wasn’t even sure about buying it. I don’t know, the whole portal gun and portals thing seemed weird to me, even though I like science fiction. Boy, was I wrong. The jokes and voice acting in this game are phenomenal—just amazing. It’s not cheesy (okay, sometimes it’s cheesy). And the different story characters all have their own sense of humor. Those characters really do have distinct personalities. And the level design? It’s just rad. By the way, I never played the first Portal game. One of these days, I’m planning to if I can spare the time. I would never have played it if I hadn’t played the sequel."
106,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"Okay, let's start with the pros (+) and cons (-), then my thoughts on this game.  
+ Some of the best characters  
+ Good story  
+ Lots of content  
+ Customizable character (you can be male or female, whatever you like)  
+ You can have a relationship with most of your companions (yes, fangirls, you can have a love interest)  
- Bad graphics (I don’t think graphics really matter anyway)  
- Weird and awkward love scenes  
- Invisible walls  
- There’s one mission that, in my opinion, was boring, but everyone has different tastes  
-/+ This isn’t really bad or good, but for those who care, your protagonist (the one you made) can’t talk.  

Now for my thoughts: I love this game. This game is probably one of the best RPGs—or games in general—I’ve ever played. So if you’re an RPG fan, you probably already have this game."
107,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"Yes, this is a nostalgia trip for thirty-somethings who remember (at least in the UK) watching the ever-irritating Timmy Mallet just for the five-minute *Transformers* cartoon. The voice actors for Optimus, Megatron, Bumblebee, and many others are back, and instantly recognizable. The distinctive cartoon transformation sound is there. Graphically, the cel-shaded presentation is perfect and very, very Generation One. But aside from that, it's actually a very fun game. The combat mechanics are extremely well done—transforming mid-fight is often a necessity and woven seamlessly into combos, making it quite unlike High Moon's excellent *War for/Fall of Cybertron* games. Another distinction is the heavy focus on melee combat, though some enemies (e.g., Seekers) require a switch to a ranged blaster."
108,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"So I downloaded the game and played it for a little while, but it was nothing special. I spent more time trying to log in than actually playing the game. There's a bug where it says there was an update to the terms of service, and every time you click 'accept,' it just pops up again. You have to restart the client for it to work. That isn't too bad, but why do I need to link my Steam and Gface accounts? They say it's for DLC, but why is that even necessary? It's also irreversible, so now a company I don't care about has access to my Steam information. As for the game itself, it's just okay. It's easily recognizable as a COD clone, except somehow they made the gunplay worse... How is that even possible?"

In my opinion, this is a genuinely great and fun game, though the format can be somewhat annoying (where the free-roam city area repopulates with enemies each time you progress the story). I especially enjoyed the 'dual play' segments (where you can play as Batman + one other character), and the ability to use a controller for most parts of the game while switching to mouse and keyboard for tank combat was greatly appreciated. Driving the Batmobile around the free-roam city, including during APC commander chases, is actually quite enjoyable once you learn to use the brakes to skid around corners—and once you master that, cruising through the city becomes truly satisfying!"
111,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"Damn fine FPS shooter—that's the bottom line. It looks, sounds, and plays great—excellent FPS mechanics, a solid story, cool characters, flawless voice acting, and a badass soundtrack. Not for the faint of heart, though—some of those cutscenes were pretty darn brutal and vivid. But when a game is this good overall, it's easier to spot the flaws, and here's what I noticed:  

- No SLI support—WTF? I had to shelve the game until I upgraded my card since it ran poorly on my old dual-GPU GTX 590. Make sure you have a decent single-GPU card.  
- Frustratingly small obstacles are often unclimbable."

- Controls  
- Sound  
- Gameplay  
- Replayability  

**Graphics:** The game has a comic-like style. The graphics are very slick, with no unnecessary details. The color schemes are nice, and it totally works for this game. You can set the graphics to 'high' without stressing your system. I run this game on an i5 Pentium processor with an NVIDIA GeForce 710M card and 8GB of memory—it runs smoothly on Windows 8.1.  

**Controls:** The game can be played with a keyboard and mouse, or with an Xbox controller."
113,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"You can see by the hours I’ve put into this game that I enjoy it. This is everything I wished a search game from COD would be. But don’t buy this game thinking it’s like COD, Battlefield, or any other shooter game. It’s a game in its own class and should be treated as such. Can’t tell you how many times I hear new players complain about getting killed really fast. Oh, God forbid you get shot in the face and die. It’s not like that doesn’t happen in real life or anything.  

Edit: Okay, so I’ve been playing this game for a while now. Thrown all kinds of money at it. One of the best MP games around. A good thing to play when you’re not feeling CS:GO."
114,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"I'm two hours in and dying from this game—it's hilarious. The gameplay is solid, the art design is beautiful, the music is surprisingly high-quality and fitting, the story/world has me hooked, and the puzzles are fun. But the best part, beyond everything else, is the comedy. If you've played any RPG since the dawn of video game RPGs, you'll laugh at the jokes, parodies, and references. Even if you've never played an RPG before, you'll still enjoy the humor. If you've played *Final Fantasy VII* or *X*, you absolutely need to play this game—without spoiling too much, I had to stop after two hours just to give my cheeks a break from laughing and smiling so much. What a delight so far."
115,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"I'm really sorry—I try to be supportive of free-to-play games and indie developers, but I just didn't enjoy this game. The description sounded right up my alley, but the execution didn't work for me. I love puzzle and exploration games, but I found this one completely unintuitive, and even after looking up how to progress, I still didn't find the gameplay fun. It also lacks a pause button—or if it has one, I never found it. Considering many sequences are timed, this feels like a critical oversight. I also think this game has more cutscenes than actual gameplay, leaving me drumming my fingers too often."
116,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"This game... phew, where to even start. It was absolutely beautiful—from the story to the graphics, I was hooked. The story wasn’t just any story; it actually felt like I was that person, trying to figure out what came next in the tale my character was telling. The gameplay was great, and I learned a lot about myself through this game (mainly my fear of heights, which I never had a problem with until the ice caverns). My gut churned the whole time, but I pushed through for Uncle Fred! If you guys made a DLC or a second game, I’d be the first to buy it and recommend it to everyone I know. Thanks to everyone involved in making this—you created an absolutely beautiful game."
117,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth is a turn-based game where you build your civilization toward a specific goal or 'victory.' In previous games, you progressed through Earth's timeline, advancing through periods like the Stone Age, Medieval Age, and Modern Age. However, in this game, you are set in the future on a mission to colonize a new planet. What I enjoy about this game is that 2K took a fresh approach by introducing new mechanics like the affinity system and orbital layer. What I didn’t enjoy was that these new mechanics could sometimes feel overwhelming. One improvement I’d suggest is incorporating new artwork, such as the environment you see when communicating with another leader."
118,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"Great game! Tons of replayability and a very fun zombie survival game! Definitely in my top 5 zombie games ever played. Edit: After playing 60+ hours, I can honestly say this is one of the better, more 'realistic' zombie games. It's very much designed like a survival horror—you must save your ammo, heal your own wounds when you bleed out, take pills when you're infected, etc. Also, I find the zombies to feel very natural and well-animated for a free-to-play game. P.S.: I would recommend getting 1 or 2 friends to play with, but the community is super friendly, and you can usually make friends or talk with people in the chat or over voice comms."
119,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"02/07/2014 - It's a shame I can't thoroughly recommend/enjoy this game because, from the short time I've played it, I know I'd be addicted if it didn't have the following two game-breaking issues:  

- No Australian servers - A single red bar puts you at a severe disadvantage and creates unbearable lag. Mind you, I played through the offline training mode, and it was stuttering/lagging as well (how does that even happen?). Combine that with the poor ping, and it just ruins the game.  

- Everything artifacts like crazy - the menus, backgrounds, training, and in-game. I've never had this happen before with this card and thought it might not like my overclock. I set my GPU back to stock settings, and sure enough, it didn't make a difference."

I did learn a lot about the world of Batman, so it was a little disappointing that so few bosses were in the game. Oh well, there are enough future games to rectify that. The combat is just the right amount of challenging, though it leans more on the easy side. Leveling up Batman wasn't very satisfying. It's the gadgets you upgrade and acquire during the campaign that add nice new gameplay mechanics. Gaining access to previously unreachable areas creates a good sense of progression."

Think Telltale's *The Walking Dead* is sad? Hohoho! Well, it's no match for *To the Moon*! Never before have I been so depressed yet fulfilled by something purely fictional. This masterpiece represents the pinnacle of storytelling in my opinion, and the soundtrack is a gorgeously charming and perfect accompaniment. Yes, the controls are a bit finicky and the gameplay isn’t the strong point, but the story is so fantastic that I didn’t care one bit. Plus, the humor of the game is great as well, and it definitely doesn’t intrude upon the distinguished nature of the story... And the *Doctor Who* references are endless."
122,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"Bastion is a bloody brilliant game with a truly great storyline. Set after a calamity, you begin rebuilding on the bastion. The game offers plenty of choices—what to build for an advantage, which weapons to use, what power-ups to equip on them, and even which drinks to consume for bonus effects. The art style and music are fantastic, with vibrant colors that prove the apocalypse doesn’t have to be dull. Best of all, the game features dynamic narration based on your actions. For example, if you pick up a weapon and then swap it in the armory, the narration might comment on your choice of the new weapon."
123,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"I originally bought this game in early development when the only currency was spacebux, and there was no 'tech tree.' That was when the game was good. All the guns at that point were equally overpowered, so there were no balance issues—everyone could kill anyone at any time. Also, the game used to give you unlimited gun slots and five loadouts. You'd think for a game with 'bajillions of guns,' they'd at least give you more than six weapon slots and three loadouts before making you pay for more. At one point, I had about three pages worth of guns and was planning new ideas for more because, personally, that's where I found the fun."
124,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"This game was a surprising gem. One often sees rave reviews for certain products that can be misleading. In this case, the reviews truly reflect the fun of this neat little game. It’s an odd mix between a classic 2D platformer and a MOBA, executed with style. I found myself enjoying characters I wouldn’t typically like in other MOBA games. I expected this trend to continue but decided to try a melee tank anyway. The outcome pleasantly surprised me, and I ended up trying more characters as they unlocked through gameplay. The art style and interface are oddly charming. As a result, I now use one of the characters as my avatar and a wallpaper from creating a card set for the game."
125,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"I just started playing, but I love this game. I put on my headphones and lose myself in the game for hours at a time. It's been a while since a game has had that effect on me. The music sets the mood, the sound effects are spot on, and the controls are perfect. I look forward to every combat encounter, and they've optimized combat extremely well. I had my doubts about the naval combat system, but it's so much fun to lay waste to multiple fleets at once! The only way to lose in this game is to fail to retreat. If the combat looks overwhelming, just get out of there, regroup, and counter-attack. Thanks, devs, for an awesome experience!"
126,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"The reboot of the Devil May Cry franchise has brought about many changes for the series, particularly for its protagonist, Dante. While fans of the original series may be upset at the changes to their beloved character, it’s certainly for the better—and this new game by Ninja Theory proves it. DmC serves as the perfect point for newcomers to jump into the series. It shows the origins of an arrogant, cynical Dante and chronicles his journey from cynicism to selflessness. Throughout, the game weaves a clear narrative arc for the new Dante, making him a compelling character to follow. The story follows Dante as he’s introduced into the corrupt world he willfully chose to ignore."
127,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"Where do I start with this absolutely beautiful game? Its story is utterly charming, packed with so much detail—it's a bundle of happiness, bad puns, annoying dogs, and secrets. It knows when to be serious but isn’t afraid of funny moments. The character design is spot-on, featuring a diverse cast with unique personalities and hidden depths. It stands out from other RPGs because you don’t have to kill anyone—a rare concept in the genre. Drawing heavy inspiration from EarthBound, one of the best RPGs I’ve ever played, it’s clear this game is something special. Plus, it easily has the best soundtrack I’ve heard in years."
128,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"I’m recommending this solely because it’s free and might be a more 'enjoyable' experience for others. As for my experience, the 'game' did nothing for me. Half the story relies on shock factor—I wasn’t shocked nor emotionally moved in any way. Maybe I’m desensitized, or maybe it was too simple to warrant a reaction from me. The other half of the game tries to paint a picture (literally) of a person in mental decline, dealing with obsession, hallucination, depression, and a few other things. In theory, it’s a cool idea. But the 'game' took me 10 minutes to complete, and that’s with reading and absorbing every bit of information I could."
129,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"Do I even need to explain why Portal is amazing? Portal is a puzzle game that introduces a concept and then lets you explore it. It's a brilliant way to challenge your mind while still being fun. Although this game isn't heavily story-driven, it did give rise to one of the most popular and well-received games of 2011. I still play and complete this game when I'm feeling bored, and I love returning to see what birthed a legend and what makes a legend.  

Gameplay: Portal's gameplay is quite simple to explain, at least. You use portals to your advantage, along with buttons that activate parts of the puzzle. There are two types of buttons in the game—one you press directly and another that requires placing a cube on it."

Since most of these reviews are about specs, I'll include mine: i5 6600k (~200€), Radeon RX 480 (~200€), Z170 Pro-Gaming (~150€), 16GB DDR4 RAM (~70€). ~650€ is definitely within the medium price range, though, granted, this rig is quite new.

Divinity: Dragon Commander comes awfully close to being one of my personal favorite RTS games. Combine this with a huge Risk-like grand strategy mode, and it hits the spot. I’m not (read: try not to be) overly biased just because this game lets you turn into a dragon, aiding your troops by supporting, attacking, and even commanding unit production, direction, and spawning all at the same time. Honestly, I do like complicated RTS games nowadays—think Civ V and so on. However, such games tend to cram complex mechanics, charts, and resources all into one overly complicated game mode."
132,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"Undertale comes together to create something greater than the sum of its parts. The graphics are solid for a retro title, and the music is pleasant, but when paired, they craft truly beautiful and impactful moments. The script runs the gamut from comedic to dramatic, heartbreaking to hopeful—sometimes all at once—while flipping RPG tropes on their head. And all this without even touching on the world, characters, story, or gameplay... I could write pages about it. But instead, I'll just say this: if you like RPGs, play this game. If you like video games, play this game. If you have seven free hours between now and your death, play this game."

The devs are very active in the community, and it really shows in the various discussion forums and dev diaries. There’s a fairly steep learning curve to the game’s mechanics, which I’m still trying to master; however, this depth of strategy offers countless ways to achieve goals and capitalize on certain situations. In my opinion, the game is nearly infinitely replayable. I find myself engrossed in every session I play, no matter how the playthrough is going."
135,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"Warframe is a fun game for the first few hours of play. After those enjoyable initial hours, you'll start to notice that the only thing left the game offers is repetition in its combat, enemies, and gameplay. The major highlight is that the developers work hard and provide semi-frequent updates, which often include substantial content—from sweeping changes to some of the game's systems to new Warframes and other tweaks or features. It's a good game to play casually, though I doubt it will hold your attention beyond a few months unless you really enjoy grinding. The upside is that the game is free, so I'd recommend trying it out. If you're looking for a quick fix, give it a shot."
136,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"This game is so... very... boring. I bought it because I believed it was a PC version of *Katamari Damacy*, a popular and fun PS2 game. Sadly, it's far from it. In this game, you go around absorbing ever bigger things to grow larger and absorb even bigger things. But the gameplay isn't as smooth as it could be, the levels aren't inventive, and what's there is a surreal horror show. I don't mean an entertaining horror show—rather, one that makes you feel depressed and question whether being alive is all it's cracked up to be. Every ""living"" creature in this game, from small pets to human beings, makes me wonder if the creators had an interest in taxidermy."
137,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"Alright. Let me explain a few things. As someone very interested in politics, I was intrigued by this game when I first heard about it. I thought, ""Oh wow! A simulator of the road to becoming president! That sounds fun!"" Well, it really wasn't. The game starts you off by saying you need to pick a side: Republican or Democrat—there's no independent or third-party option. A little disappointed but still optimistic, I carried on to see what I could do. I’ll give the game credit—the character customization, though limited, is pretty fun to mess around with. It’s the only time you get the option to wear your head or not in a campaign. Literally."
138,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"Fallout 3's story was better. Settlements disrupt the narrative to the point where you'll resent babysitting them instead of progressing the story. Some keys are hardcoded and can't be rebound. Bugs are rampant—my Pip-Boy vanished permanently at one point, forcing me to look up console commands to restore it. Power armor requires little effort; it's practically handed to you early on, and fusion cores are abundant in shops, greatly diminishing its value compared to earlier Fallout games. The story is mediocre, and most aspects of this game are average—except for its stability, which far surpasses Fallout 3's frequent crashes. Is it better than Fallout 3? No. Better than New Vegas? No. This title was massively overhyped for how disappointing it truly is."

What I liked:  
- Visuals up until the last level (ice caves)  
- The story isn't great, but the ending (after the credits) made me not regret spending time on this game  

What I disliked:  
- Visuals in the last level are uninteresting  
- Gameplay in the last level becomes much harder, turning into a frustrating experience of repetition  
- Achievements are too hard—13 out of 15 have been achieved by less than 2.1% of players"
140,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"Pros:  
+ Good graphics  

Cons:  
- Bugs (especially in the environment—you may get stuck or your shots may hit an invisible wall despite having a clear line of sight to the enemy)  
- The game handholds/babysits you too much  
- Dumb AI  
- Enemies always seem to know your location once you're spotted  
- Frustrating godlike accuracy by enemies, similar to the first Ghost Warrior  
- Terrible checkpoints and save system  
- Boring story that I couldn't care less about  

I wouldn't recommend it unless it's 90% off—even then, playing this game feels like a tedious chore. I'm only finishing it to move on to the next game in my library. Given how much time I wasted on the first Ghost Warrior (which was equally boring and left me feeling liberated when I finished), I probably won't play this one to the end."

For one thing, I have a Vive and I'm much more interested in playing room-scale games with the controllers. Beyond that, the game is initially awe-inspiring in the scale of its universe, but I also felt that same scale was a hindrance to my enjoyment. The learning curve and the amount of time required to do anything interesting at the beginning were both too much for me. Perhaps if I were more patient and had more time for gaming, this would be compelling to me. But I don't have either, and there are plenty more VR games I'd rather spend my time on."
144,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,game_review,"Hands down, my favorite first-person shooter of all time. Run-and-gun Rambos need not apply. Recoil and ballistics are realistic. Single hits to the chest, neck, or head from rifle-caliber weapons almost always result in death unless it's just a graze. Rounds drop over distance, and short, controlled bursts are required to stay on target. There's no magical ammunition pool—if you reload halfway through your magazine constantly, you'll end up with a pouch full of half-empty mags. You can't run forever; sprint for too long, and your aim will suffer as you gasp for breath until you recover. Rest your weapon on your elbows while prone or on a windowsill to steady your aim. Accuracy suffers when standing."

I loved it, however; it was unforgiving in the early stages but rewarding when you did things right.  

As for XCOM 2, I love it. The game runs pretty well for me on medium settings, and I'm using a GTX 560 with 2GB of VRAM. At first, the game defaulted to high settings and ran a bit sluggishly—not unplayably so, but switching to medium smoothed things out.  

I’m not sure if I’m just lucky when it comes to game issues, but many of the negative reviews sound like they’re coming from overly entitled people."

However, the effectively linear interaction between motion and light or electricity restricts access to broader classes of quantum states of motion, such as cat states or energy-squeezed states.

Spamming strategies are difficult to capture, as they can change rapidly over time, vary among spammers and target products, and, more critically, often remain unknown. Additionally, most existing detectors prioritize detection accuracy, which does not fully align with the goal of preserving the trustworthiness of product evaluations. To address these challenges, we formulate a minimax game where spammers and spam detectors compete based on their practical objectives, not solely on detection accuracy.

Within this family, we identified a tracking solution with a single parameter to simultaneously control the transfer fidelity, the excited-state population, and robustness. We defined a measure of robustness for UH-fidelity transfer as the minimum percentile deviation in pulse areas at which the infidelity exceeds $10^{-4}$. The robustness of our shaped pulses was found to surpass that of Gaussian and adiabatically optimized pulses for moderate pulse areas."

Due to nonconvexity, there exist multiple local minima that are not globally optimal, even when the mixture is well-separated. We show that all local minima share a common structural form that partially identifies the true mixture's component centers. Specifically, each local minimum involves either fitting multiple Gaussians to a single true component or fitting a single Gaussian to multiple true components, without overlap. Our results hold when the true mixture components satisfy a certain separation condition and remain valid even if the number of components is over- or under-specified. For Gaussian mixtures with three components, we derive sharper results in terms of how they scale with the separation between components."

We demonstrate that this algorithm can resolve near-exact collisions (with separations as small as a fraction of a physical radius) while maintaining the same time step as in weakly perturbed systems like the Solar System. We test the long-term behavior on systems of six super-Earths undergoing strong scattering over 50 kyr. Comparisons with hybrid methods like Mercury show that our algorithm achieves superior energy conservation at equivalent computational cost."
207,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"Entanglement is a key resource for quantum information processing. A widely used tool for detecting entanglement is the entanglement witness, where measuring the witness operator is guaranteed to yield positive results for all separable states and can be negative for certain entangled states. In practice, due to the exponentially increasing Hilbert-space dimension with respect to system size, constructing an efficient entanglement witness for general multipartite entangled states is highly challenging. For $n$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-like states, the most robust witness scheme requires $n+1$ local measurement settings and can tolerate up to $1/2$ white noise. In comparison, the most efficient witness for GHZ-like states requires only two local measurement settings and can tolerate up to $1/3$ white noise."
208,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"Within general relativity, the unique stationary solution for an isolated black hole is the Kerr spacetime, which has a distinctive multipolar structure determined solely by its mass and spin. We develop a general method to extract the multipole moments of arbitrary stationary spacetimes and apply it to a broad family of horizonless microstate geometries. These geometries can break the axial and equatorial symmetry of the Kerr metric and exhibit a far richer multipolar structure, offering a pathway to phenomenologically constrain fuzzball models. We present numerical evidence that all multipole moments are typically larger (in absolute value) than those of a Kerr black hole with identical mass and spin. Current measurements of the quadrupole moment of black-hole candidates can only impose mild constraints on fuzzballs, whereas future gravitational-wave detections of extreme mass-ratio inspirals with the LISA space mission will refine these bounds by orders of magnitude."
209,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"Reasoning about graphs that evolve over time is a challenging task in many domains, such as bioinformatics, physics, and social networks. We consider a common scenario where edges can represent short-term interactions (e.g., messaging) or long-term structural connections (e.g., friendship). In practice, long-term edges are often specified by humans, which can be both costly to produce and suboptimal for downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a model based on temporal point processes and variational autoencoders that learns to infer temporal attention between nodes by observing node communication. Since temporal attention drives feature propagation between nodes, using node interaction dynamics to learn this key component offers greater flexibility while avoiding issues associated with human-specified edges."
210,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"Observations of thermally driven transverse vibrations in a photonic crystal waveguide (pcw) are reported. The pcw consists of two parallel nanobeams separated by a 240 nm vacuum gap. Models are developed and validated for the transduction of beam motion into phase and amplitude modulation of a weak optical probe propagating in a guided mode (gm) of the pcw, for probe frequencies both far from and near the dielectric band edge. Since our pcw is designed for near-field atom trapping, this research establishes a foundation for assessing potential detrimental effects of thermal motion on optical atomic traps near pcw surfaces. Longer-term goals include achieving strong atom-mediated coupling between individual phonons of vibration and single photons propagating in the pcw's gms, enabling quantum-level optomechanics with atoms, photons, and phonons."
211,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"We establish natural splittings for the values of global Mackey functors at orthogonal, unitary, and symplectic groups. In particular, the restriction homomorphisms between the orthogonal, unitary, and symplectic groups of adjacent dimensions are naturally split epimorphisms. The interest in these splittings arises from equivariant stable homotopy theory. The equivariant stable homotopy groups of every global spectrum form a global Mackey functor, so the splittings imply that certain long exact homotopy group sequences split into short exact sequences. For the real and complex global Thom spectra $\mathbf{mo}$ and $\mathbf{mu}$, the splittings imply the regularity of various Euler classes related to the tautological representations of $O(n)$ and $U(n)$."
212,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"Baryonic feedback effects cause a suppression of the weak lensing angular power spectrum on small scales. The poorly constrained shape and amplitude of this suppression represent a significant source of uncertainty for upcoming cosmological weak lensing surveys such as Euclid or LSST. In this first paper of a two-part series, we use simulations to construct a Euclid-like tomographic mock dataset for the cosmic shear power spectrum and the corresponding covariance matrix, both corrected for baryonic effects following the baryonification method of Schneider et al. (2019). Additionally, we develop an emulator to rapidly predict the baryonic power suppression, enabling us to perform a likelihood inference analysis for a standard ΛCDM cosmology with both cosmological and astrophysical parameters."
213,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"Spontaneous conversations in real-world settings, such as those captured in child-centered recordings, have been shown to be among the most challenging audio files to process. However, developing speech processing models capable of handling such diverse conditions would be highly valuable for language acquisition studies, where researchers examine the quantity and quality of speech children hear and produce, as well as for early diagnosis and assessing remediation effects. In this paper, we present our approach to designing an open-source neural network that classifies audio segments into vocalizations produced by the child wearing the recording device, vocalizations from other children, adult male speech, and adult female speech. To achieve this, we compiled diverse child-centered corpora totaling 260 hours of recordings across 10 languages."
214,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"Density-based clustering relies on the idea of linking groups to specific features of the probability distribution underlying the data. The reference to a true, yet unknown, population structure allows framing the clustering problem in a standard inferential setting, where the concept of ideal population clustering is defined as the partition induced by the true density function. The nonparametric formulation of this approach, known as modal clustering, establishes a correspondence between the groups and the domains of attraction of the density modes. Operationally, a nonparametric density estimate is required, and a proper selection of the amount of smoothing—governing the shape of the density and thus potentially the modal structure—is crucial to identifying the final partition. In this work, we address the issue of density estimation for modal clustering from an asymptotic perspective."
215,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"The tails of diboson production at the LHC are sensitive to the interference between the Standard Model and higher-dimension operators parameterizing the effects of heavy new physics. However, helicity selection rules for diboson scattering amplitudes set an obstruction to the naïve interference contributions of dimension-six operators, causing the leading contribution to the total diboson rate correction to cancel. In this case, carefully measuring the azimuthal decay angles ""resurrects"" the interference, restoring sensitivity to the ""non-interfering"" operators. We explore these signatures in detail and find that the EFT uncertainties associated with higher-dimensional operators are uniquely well-suppressed by constructing an asymmetry variable generated exclusively by these non-interfering operators, relegating the effects of higher-dimensional, interfering operators to the same status as statistical errors in this observable."
216,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"Causal inference from observational data is the goal of many data analyses in the health and social sciences. However, academic statistics has often viewed data analyses with a causal objective unfavorably. The introduction of the term ""data science"" presents a historic opportunity to redefine data analysis in a way that naturally accommodates causal inference from observational data. Like others before, we categorize the scientific contributions of data science into three classes of tasks: description, prediction, and counterfactual prediction (which includes causal inference). A clear classification of data science tasks is necessary to discuss the data, assumptions, and methods required to successfully accomplish each task. We argue that failing to adequately describe the role of subject-matter expert knowledge in data analysis contributes to widespread misunderstandings about data science."
217,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"The Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) requires the existence of superextremal particles in any consistent quantum theory of gravity. The standard understanding is that these particles ensure extremal black holes are either unstable or marginally stable, but it remains unclear what goes wrong if this condition fails. This note demonstrates that, for a generic Einsteinian quantum theory of gravity in AdS, exact stability of extremal black branes conflicts with rigorously proven quantum information theorems about entanglement entropy. Avoiding this contradiction leads to a nonperturbative version of the WGC, which reduces to the usual statement at weak coupling. The argument is general and does not rely on supersymmetry or a specific UV completion, assuming only the validity of Einsteinian gravity, effective field theory, and holography."
218,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"Understanding how strongly correlated two-dimensional (2D) systems can give rise to unconventional superconductivity with high critical temperatures remains one of the major unsolved problems in condensed matter physics. Ultracold 2D Fermi gases have emerged as clean and controllable model systems to study the interplay of strong correlations and reduced dimensionality, yet direct evidence of superfluidity in these systems has been lacking. Here, we demonstrate superfluidity in an ultracold 2D Fermi gas by moving a periodic potential through the system and observing no dissipation below a critical velocity v$_{\rm c}$. We measure v$_{\rm c}$ as a function of interaction strength and find a maximum in the crossover regime between bosonic and fermionic superfluidity. Our measurements establish ultracold Fermi gases as a powerful platform for studying the influence of reduced dimensionality on strongly correlated superfluids."
219,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are mathematical models used in many application areas such as climatology, bioinformatics, and chemical engineering due to their intuitive appeal for modeling. Despite ODEs' wide usage in modeling, the frequent absence of analytic solutions makes it difficult to estimate ODE parameters from data, especially when the model has many variables and parameters. This paper proposes a Bayesian ODE parameter estimation algorithm that is fast and accurate even for models with many parameters. The proposed method approximates an ODE model with a state-space model based on the equations of a numerical solver. It enables fast estimation by avoiding computations of a full numerical solution in the likelihood. The posterior is obtained by a variational Bayes method, more specifically, the approximate Riemannian conjugate gradient method (Honkela et al.)."
220,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"We study the transport properties and superconducting proximity effect in nsn junctions formed by a time-reversal symmetry-broken Weyl semimetal (WSM) in proximity to an $s$-wave superconductor. We find that the differential conductance and induced pairing amplitudes strongly depend on the angle between the junction direction in real space and the axis separating the Weyl nodes in momentum space. We identify the influence of a chiral chemical potential—i.e., the electron population imbalance between Weyl nodes of opposite chirality—on the transport characteristics of the junction. Remarkably, we observe a net spin polarization of Cooper pairs generated via Andreev reflection in the two WSM regions. The spin polarization is opposite in the two WSM regions and highly sensitive to the chirality imbalance and excitation energy."
221,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"Metal ion implantation into ceramics has been demonstrated to be an effective and controllable technique for tailoring the surface electrical conductivity of ceramic pieces, and this approach has been used in numerous applications. Importantly, it provides a method for grading the voltage drop across high-voltage insulators, thereby increasing the maximum operational voltage that can be applied without surface flashover. However, a concern regarding this method is the long-term stability of the implantation-induced conductivity, particularly if the implanted metal species is readily oxidized. Here, we report on our examination of the long-term behavior of the surface conductivity of titanium-implanted alumina. The results indicate that after an initial drop of up to 40% in the first few weeks post-implantation, the conductivity exhibits only a very slow decrease of approximately 10% over the following year."
222,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"We introduce a novel Skyrme-like conserved current in the effective theory of pions and vector mesons based on the idea of hidden local symmetry. The associated charge is equivalent to the Skyrmion charge for any smooth configuration. In addition, there exist singular configurations that can be identified as \( n_f=1 \) baryons charged under the new symmetry. Under this identification, the vector mesons play the role of the Chern-Simons vector fields living on the quantum Hall droplet that forms the \( n_f=1 \) baryon. We propose that this current is the correct effective expression for the baryon current at low energies. This proposal provides a unified picture for the two types of baryons and allows them to continuously transform into one another in a natural way. Moreover, Chern-Simons dualities on the droplet can be interpreted as a result of Seiberg-like duality between gluons and vector mesons."
223,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"Interfacial spin-orbit coupling in Josephson junctions offers an intriguing way to combine anomalous Hall and Josephson physics in a single device. We theoretically study how the superposition of both effects impacts the transport properties of superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator/superconductor junctions. Transverse momentum-dependent skew tunneling of Cooper pairs through the spin-active ferromagnetic insulator interface creates sizable transverse Hall supercurrents, which we refer to as anomalous Josephson Hall effect currents. We generalize the Furusaki-Tsukada formula, initially established to quantify conventional (tunneling) Josephson currents, to evaluate the transverse current components and demonstrate that their amplitudes are widely adjustable through the spin-orbit coupling strengths or the superconducting phase difference across the junction. As a clear spectroscopic fingerprint of Josephson junctions, well-localized subgap bound states form around the interface."
224,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"Following the suggestion from the Monte Carlo experiments in Jiménez (J. of Turbul. 2020), that dipoles are as important to the dynamics of decaying two-dimensional turbulence as individual vortex cores, it is found that the kinetic energy of this flow is carried by elongated streams formed by the concatenation of dipoles. Vortices separate into a family of small, fast-moving cores and another family of larger, slowly moving ones, which can be described as 'frozen' into a slowly evolving 'crystal'. The kinematics of both families are very different, and only the former is self-similar. The latter is responsible for most of the kinetic energy of the flow, and its vortices form the dipoles and the streams. Mechanisms are discussed for the growth of this slow component."
225,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"Continuous-time quantum walks have proven to be an extremely useful framework for designing several quantum algorithms. Typically, the running time of quantum algorithms in this framework is characterized by the quantum hitting time: the time required for the quantum walk to find a vertex of interest with high probability. In this article, we provide improved upper bounds for the quantum hitting time that can be applied to several CTQW-based quantum algorithms. Specifically, we apply our techniques to the glued-trees problem, improving the hitting time upper bound by a polynomial factor: from \(o(n^5)\) to \(o(n^2\log n)\). Moreover, our methods also exponentially improve the precision dependence of the continuous-time quantum walk-based algorithm by Chakraborty et al. for finding a marked node on any ergodic, reversible Markov chain."

Dry (or ""loss-cone"") EMRIs, previously considered the main EMRI sources for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, are primarily produced by multi-body scattering in the nuclear star cluster and gravitational capture. In this letter, we highlight an alternative EMRI formation channel: (wet) EMRI formation assisted by the accretion flow around accreting galactic-center massive black holes (MBHs). In this channel, the accretion disk captures stellar-mass black holes initially moving on inclined orbits and subsequently drives them to migrate toward the MBH—this process boosts the EMRI formation rate in such galaxies by orders of magnitude."

Under these circumstances, we still expect our recommender systems to attract users immediately so they decide to stay on the website and become active. This problem falls into the new user cold-start category and is crucial to a company's development and even survival. Existing work on user cold-start recommendation either requires additional user effort, such as setting up an interview process, or relies on side information [10], such as user demographics, locations, or social relations. However, users may be unwilling to participate in interviews, and side information for cold-start users is often unavailable."
228,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"Deep learning has solved many problems beyond the reach of heuristic algorithms. It has also been successfully applied in wireless communications, even though current radio systems are well-understood and optimal algorithms exist for many tasks. While some gains have been achieved by learning individual parts of a receiver, a better approach is to jointly learn the entire receiver. However, this often results in a challenging nonlinear problem for which the optimal solution is impractical to implement. To address this, we propose a deep fully convolutional neural network, DeepRx, which executes the entire receiver pipeline—from frequency domain signal stream to uncoded bits—in a 5G-compliant manner. We enable accurate channel estimation by carefully constructing the convolutional neural network's input using both data and pilot symbols."
229,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"Mutation-based fuzzing typically uses an initial set of non-crashing seed inputs (a corpus) to generate new inputs through mutation. A corpus of potential seeds often contains thousands of similar inputs. This lack of diversity can result in wasted fuzzing effort due to exhaustive mutation from all available seeds. To address this, fuzzers include distillation tools (e.g., afl-cmin) that select the smallest subset of seeds triggering the same range of instrumentation data points as the full corpus. Common practice suggests that minimizing both the number and cumulative size of seeds leads to more efficient fuzzing, which we systematically explore. We present results from over 34 CPU-years of fuzzing with five distillation approaches to understand their impact on finding bugs in real-world software."
230,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"In this paper, we investigate multi-agent discrete-event systems with partial observation. The agents can be divided into several groups, in each of which the agents have similar (isomorphic) state transition structures and thus can be relabeled into the same template. Based on the template, a scalable supervisor whose state size and computational cost are independent of the number of agents is designed for the case of partial observation. The scalable supervisor under partial observation does not need to be recomputed, regardless of how many agents are added to or removed from the system. We generalize our earlier results to partial observation by proposing sufficient conditions for safety and maximal permissiveness of the scalable least restrictive supervisor at the template level. An example is provided to illustrate the proposed scalable supervisory synthesis."
231,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"Electric network frequency (ENF) fluctuations constitute a powerful tool in multimedia forensics. An efficient approach for ENF estimation is introduced with temporal windowing based on the filter-bank Capon spectral estimator. A type of Gohberg-Semencul factorization of the model covariance matrix is used due to the Toeplitz structure of the covariance matrix. Moreover, this approach employs, for the first time in the field of ENF, a temporal window—not necessarily a rectangular one—at the stage preceding spectral estimation. Krylov matrices are utilized for fast implementation of matrix inversions. The proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in ENF estimation when a short time window of 1 second is employed in power recordings. In speech recordings, the proposed approach yields highly accurate results in terms of both time complexity and accuracy."

The package also includes classical and robust pre-processing utilities, such as generalized spatial signs, along with dedicated plotting functionality and cross-validation tools.

233,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"The nonlinear fluorescence emission has been widely applied for high spatial resolution optical imaging. Here, we studied the fluorescence anomalous saturating effect of the nitrogen vacancy defect in diamond. Fluorescence reduction was observed under high-power laser excitation. This increased the nonlinearity of the fluorescence emission and altered the spatial frequency distribution of the fluorescence image. We employed a differential excitation protocol to extract the high spatial frequency information. By modulating the excitation laser's power, the spatial resolution of imaging was improved approximately 1.6 times compared to confocal microscopy. Due to the simplicity of the experimental setup and data processing, we expect this method can be used to improve the spatial resolution of sensing and biological labeling with defects in solids."
234,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"When random effects are correlated with sample design variables, the conventional approach of using individual survey weights (constructed to be inversely proportional to unit survey inclusion probabilities) to form a pseudo-likelihood no longer yields asymptotically unbiased inference. We develop a weight-exponentiated formulation for the random effects distribution that achieves unbiased inference for generating hyperparameters of the random effects. We compare our approach with frequentist methods relying on numerical integration, showing that only the Bayesian method achieves both unbiased estimation with respect to the sampling design distribution and consistency with respect to the population generating distribution. Our simulations and real data example from a business establishment survey demonstrate the utility of our approach across different modeling formulations and sampling designs. This work serves as a capstone for recent developments combining traditional survey estimation approaches with the Bayesian modeling paradigm, bridging these two rich but distinct sub-fields."

The reduced symmetries of these emerging materials give rise to inhomogeneous electron, optical, valley, and spin responses, as well as entirely new properties such as ferroelasticity, ferroelectricity, magnetism, spin-wave phenomena, large nonlinear optical properties, photogalvanic effects, and superconductivity. Novel electronic topological properties, nonlinear elastic properties, and structural phase transformations can also occur due to low symmetry.

236,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"The orientational dynamics in the isotropic phase of a comb-shaped nematic polymer with mesogenic and functional side groups were studied using Kerr effect and dielectric spectroscopy. For the first time, it was found that in a mesogenic polymer, unlike low-molecular-weight mesogens, the relaxation of electric birefringence of a melt above the nematic-isotropic phase transition temperature can be described by a sum of several exponential processes, two of which play a decisive role. These main processes replace each other within a temperature range of about fifty degrees. Dielectric spectroscopy also revealed two orientational relaxation processes: the first arises from rotation of the side mesogenic groups, while the second is associated with motion of the main chain segments."
237,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"Deep hashing methods have demonstrated strong retrieval accuracy and efficiency in large-scale image retrieval. Optimizing discrete hash bits remains a key focus in deep hashing methods. A common strategy in these approaches is to employ an activation function, such as $\operatorname{sigmoid}(\cdot)$ or $\operatorname{tanh}(\cdot)$, and minimize a quantization loss to approximate discrete values. However, this paradigm may cause an increasing number of hash bits to become trapped in the wrong saturated regions of the activation functions without recovery. We refer to this issue as the ""dead bits problem (dbp)."" Additionally, existing quantization losses can further exacerbate dbp. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective gradient amplifier applied before activation functions to mitigate dbp."

We consider both the possibility that the triplets are stable and contribute to the dark matter density, or that they decay via mixing with the Standard Model Higgs boson. The former is constrained by disappearing charged track searches at the LHC and by dark matter direct detection experiments, while the latter is constrained by existing multilepton collider searches. We find that a two-step electroweak phase transition involving a stable triplet with a negative quadratic term is ruled out by direct detection searches, while an unstable triplet with a mass less than $230\ \mathrm{GeV}$ is excluded at $95\%$ confidence level."
239,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,paper_abstract,"This paper demonstrates that the eccentric debris rings observed around the stars Fomalhaut and HD 202628 are narrower than predicted by the standard eccentric planet perturbation scenario (often termed ""pericenter glow""). The standard scenario assumes an initially circular and narrow belt of planetesimals at semi-major axis \(a\), whose eccentricity is raised to \(e_f\) after the gas disc disperses due to secular perturbations from an eccentric planet, producing a belt of width \(2ae_f\). In a slight variation of this scenario, narrower belts can form if the planetesimals initially possess eccentricity, which may arise from earlier planet perturbations during the gas-rich protoplanetary disc phase. However, a primordial eccentricity could also result from instabilities that enhance the disc eccentricity, without requiring the presence of any planets."

Here, we report measurements of many-body modes in 1D gated wires using a tunneling spectroscopy technique. We observe two distinct Fermi seas at high energies, associated with spin and charge excitations, along with the emergence of three additional 1D 'replica' modes that intensify as the wire length decreases.

In this paper, we identify a surprising consequence of popularity-based rankings: the fewer the items reporting a given signal, the greater the share of overall traffic they collectively attract. This few-get-richer effect arises in settings where there are few distinct classes of items (e.g., left-leaning news sources versus right-leaning news sources), and items are ranked by popularity. We analytically demonstrate that the few-get-richer effect emerges when users tend to click on top-ranked items and have heterogeneous preferences for item classes. Through simulations, we examine how the strength of the effect varies with assumptions about the setting and human behavior. We also experimentally test our predictions in an online study with human participants. Our findings have important implications for understanding the spread of misinformation."

To address this issue, we introduce a new sparsity dimension—pattern-based sparsity—which combines pattern and connectivity sparsity, achieving both high accuracy and hardware efficiency. With carefully designed patterns, our proposed pruning method consistently enhances accuracy and improves feature extraction capability across different DNN architectures and datasets. Additionally, our pattern-aware pruning framework simultaneously performs pattern library extraction, pattern selection, pattern and connectivity pruning, and weight training. Our approach to pattern-based sparsity naturally aligns with compiler optimizations for highly efficient DNN execution on mobile platforms."

To start, understand what stage fright is. Humans, social animals that we are, are wired to worry about reputation. Public speaking can threaten it. Before a speech, you fret, *What if people think I'm awful and I'm an idiot?*"

[The way we work] Around 15 percent of American workers don’t have traditional full-time jobs. They’re part-time, contract workers, or temps. The term 'side hustle' fits this ethos, where people combine a few different things to make a living. The word 'side hustle' has its roots in popular African American newspapers. In the 1920s, these papers used 'hustle' to refer to a kind of scam. By the 1950s, they used 'side hustle' to describe legitimate work as well. A side hustle is a little different from a second job. A second job is about necessity."

One is synthetic, the other organic. One is imposed on the environment, the other creates it. One is designed for nature, the other is designed by her. Michelangelo said that when he looked at raw marble, he saw a figure struggling to be free. The chisel was Michelangelo's only tool. But living things are not chiseled. They grow. And in our smallest units of life, our cells, we carry all the information required for every other cell to function and to replicate. Tools also have consequences. At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by the rigors of manufacturing and mass production."

We’re working really hard to move past stuff like that, so we need a new way to deal with stage nerves.

I want to know how they rely on the water’s bounty for their livelihood. Understanding all of this enables us to shift our perception of seafood away from a commodity to an opportunity to restore our ecosystem. It allows us to celebrate the seafood that we’re so fortunate to eat. So what do we call this? I think we call it restorative seafood. Where sustainability is the capacity to endure and maintain, restorative is the ability to replenish and progress."

Here we were, watching these incredible athletes—the goals were amazing, the games were clean and engaging—and at the same time, outside the field, these women were advocating for equal pay, and in some countries, any pay at all for their sport. Because we were mildly obsessed, we wanted to watch the games live, and we decided that one of the Spanish-speaking networks in the U.S. was the best place for us to start.

I want to tell you about the Yap because their form of money is truly fascinating. They used limestone discs called rai stones. The Yap didn’t actually move these rai stones around or exchange them the way we do with coins, because rai stones could be quite massive. The largest was about four tons and twelve feet across. So the Yap simply kept track of who owned which part of each stone. There’s a story about some sailors who were transporting a stone across the ocean when they encountered trouble, and the stone actually fell in."

If you insist you’re innocent anyway, you’ll likely be found guilty and executed. But if you confess, apologize, and implicate others for good measure, you’ll go free. Do you give a false confession—or risk a public hanging? This was the choice facing those accused of witchcraft in the village of Salem, Massachusetts, between February 1692 and May 1693. They were victims of paranoia about the supernatural, misdirected religious fervor—and a justice system that valued repentance over truth. Salem was settled in 1626 by Puritans, a group of English Protestants. Life was strict and isolated for the people of Salem. Battles with their Native American neighbors and groups of French settlers were commonplace."

Unfortunately, there aren’t nearly enough donor organs available to meet that demand. What if, instead of waiting, we could create brand-new, customized organs from scratch? That’s the idea behind bioprinting, a branch of regenerative medicine currently under development. We’re not yet able to print complex organs, but simpler tissues—including blood vessels and tubes responsible for nutrient and waste exchange—are already within our grasp. Bioprinting is a biological cousin of 3D printing, a technique that deposits layers of material on top of each other to construct a three-dimensional object one slice at a time."

On top of that, those are the places trouble comes from. So we have an ironic problem—good teachers don’t want to go to just those places where they’re needed the most. I started in 1999 to try and address this problem with an experiment, which was a very simple experiment in New Delhi."

I ask my students these two questions, and then I share how I answer them, which is in these three sentences: I am the daughter of Black writers, who are descended from freedom fighters who broke their chains and changed the world.

Sputnik was not actually the first piece of human technology to enter space. That distinction belongs to the V-2 rocket, used by Germany in missile attacks against Allied cities as a last-ditch effort in the final years of World War II. It wasn't very effective, but by the war's end, both the U.S. and U.S.S.R. had captured the technology—along with the scientists who developed it—and began using them for their own projects."

From my experience and that of the women around me, I can tell you that it's exhausting. It's exhausting to carefully take out a brown paper bag hiding a pad, stuff it into your pocket in the middle of a class, and rush to the washroom as discreetly as possible.

Unfortunately, when I was there, I couldn’t spot a single one, but the antlers serve as proof.

His skin was covered in painful scabs, and he wondered why he alone had been marked with this affliction.

Essentially, the company was developing a medical device that could run an entire blood panel from just a finger-stick of blood. This meant you wouldn’t need a large needle stuck in your arm to get blood tests done.

In the center of this cloud, our Sun formed and ignited. Along with it, what we now know as planets, comets, and asteroids formed. What then happened, according to theory, is that when Earth had cooled down a bit after its formation, comets massively impacted Earth and delivered water to it.

Roosevelt famously loved the outdoors, but Muir had invited him there for more than just camping: Yosemite was in danger. Though Yosemite became protected land in 1864, the valley was still at risk of overdevelopment in 1903. It was at the heart of a decades-old struggle to set aside land for both preservation and public use—two goals that were much easier said than done.

Carbon works in a natural cycle, present in all living things: in the soil, in the oceans, in the atmosphere, and in rocks deep underground. When plants and other living things die, much of their stored carbon makes its way back to the atmosphere until new plants grow and reabsorb it. But over millions of years, some of the carbon stored in ancient trees and sea life becomes rock, and some becomes fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas. Natural events, such as volcanic eruptions, release some of the carbon trapped in rock. Human activities, like burning fossil fuels, also release some of that prehistoric carbon. Today, humans release around 60 times more carbon than all the volcanoes on the planet each year."

Yet one of the greatest differences between natural and human technologies relates to robustness. Robust systems remain stable in complex and unfamiliar environments. Remarkably, cockroaches can self-stabilize while running over rough terrain. When we equipped them with a jet pack or subjected them to a perturbation like an earthquake, we found that their finely tuned legs enable them to self-stabilize without relying on brainpower. They can traverse complex terrain like grass effortlessly without losing stability. We uncovered a new behavior where, due to their body shape, they automatically roll onto their side to navigate through this artificial grass test section. Robust systems can perform multiple tasks using the same structure—here's a new behavior we've discovered."

That’s just how the media has been portraying people who look like me. One study found that 80 percent of news coverage about Islam and Muslims is negative. And studies show that most Americans say they don’t know a Muslim. I guess people don’t talk to their Uber drivers. (Laughter) Well, for those of you who have never met a Muslim, it’s great to meet you."
295,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,speech,"We need to build a weather service for water. Yet, until we collectively demand accountability, the incentives to fund it will not exist. The first time I spoke at a conference was here at TED, eight years ago. Fresh out of grad school, little did I know that in those few minutes onstage, I was framing the questions I would be asked for the next decade. And, like too many 20-somethings, I expected to solve the world's problems—more specifically, the world's water problems—with my technology. I had a lot to learn.  

It was seductive, believing that our biggest water quality problems persist because they're so hard to identify. I presumed that we just needed simpler, faster, and more affordable sensors. I was wrong."
296,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,speech,"Indeed, for 20 years, I worked in finance. I knew everything about finance, for sure. I understood the global economy because it was my life. All the topics you could bring up about ecology, the end of the world, and so on—I knew them like the back of my hand, but I didn’t really believe in them. In 2007, an extremely unusual event occurred—you may remember—the subprime crisis, the collapse of major American banks. It was an electric shock. I had quite a few stormy conversations with my wife about the matter, about my job, about the limits of the model. Beyond the crisis, I realized I was completely wrong, that we were heading for disaster."

We can transmit really complicated thoughts to one another. What I'm doing right now is making sounds with my mouth as I exhale. I'm making tones, hisses, and puffs, and those are creating air vibrations. Those vibrations travel to you, hit your eardrums, and then your brain takes those vibrations and transforms them into thoughts. I hope. (laughter) I hope that's happening. Because of this ability, we humans can transmit our ideas across vast reaches of space and time. We can transmit knowledge across minds."

It’s 1988, and scientist James Hansen has just testified to the United States Congress that global warming trends are caused by human activity and will pose an increasing threat to humanity in the future. Well, well. That’s unusually prescient for a human. Looking for a wedding dress? Try a new take on a timeless classic. It’s sleek, flattering, and modest—just like the traditional dress. Commercials. Could anything be more insufferable? It’s 1997, and the United States Senate has called a hearing about global warming. Some expert witnesses point out that past periods in Earth’s history were warmer than the 20th century."
300,hybrid,none,none,polish_minor,speech,"Someone once said that politics is, of course, ""showbiz for ugly people."" So, on that basis, I feel like I've really arrived. The other thing to consider is what an honor it is, as a politician, to give a TED Talk, particularly here in the U.K., where the reputation of politics—with the expenses scandal—has sunk so low. There was even a story recently that scientists had considered replacing rats in their experiments with politicians. And someone asked, ""Why?"" They said, ""Well, there's no shortage of politicians, no one really minds what happens to them, and, after all, there are some things that rats just won't do."" (Laughter) Now, I know you all love data, so I'm starting with a data-rich slide."
