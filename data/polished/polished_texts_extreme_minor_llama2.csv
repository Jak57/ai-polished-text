At its core, Magic: The Gathering is a social game meant to be enjoyed with friends (or frenemies) - laughing, trash talking, and dropping game-winning bombs. However, Wizards' recent design choices seem to have forgotten this. If you choose to play with friends, you can't earn gold, and gold is crucial as it unlocks everything in the game. To make matters worse, they've implemented a daily cap on gold earnings, understandable given its importance.

While they offer more storywise, the combat feels sloppy and doesn't feel as sharp as Arkham City managed to make it. As of writing this recommendation (26/10/2013), there is a game-breaking bug that stops a side mission from ever being completed (main story not affected).

A report by University College London researchers claims that lowering the drink-drive limit from 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood to 50mg could save 65 lives a year. The findings are being published by the parliamentary advisory council for transport safety as MPs prepare to vote on the government's road safety bill. The bill includes changes to speeding fines but not the drink-drive limit. According to the research, conducted by transport expert Professor Richard Allsop, lowering the limit would also lead to 230 fewer serious injuries on the UK's roads compared to 2003. The study estimates that this would save the country Â£119m annually. A previous estimate, contained in a 1998 Department of Transport document, suggested that such a move could save 50 lives a year."

Instead of sensing the voltage drop caused by radiation, the proposed system measures the pulse width, i.e., the time it takes for the voltage to return to its baseline. This obviates the need for using power-hungry and large analog-to-digital converters. A prototype ASIC is fabricated in TSMC 65 nm LP CMOS process and consumes the average static power of 0.535 mW under 1.2 V analog and digital power supply.

Our results hold for the setting where the true mixture components satisfy a certain separation condition, and are valid even when the number of components is over- or under-specified.

The latter can break the axial and equatorial symmetry of the Kerr metric and have a much richer multipolar structure, which provides a portal to constrain fuzzball models phenomenologically. We find numerical evidence that all multipole moments are typically larger (in absolute value) than those of a Kerr black hole with the same mass and spin.

The theorem has important implications for our understanding of black holes and the behavior of matter and energy at very high energies, as it shows that any attempt to describe the behavior of a black hole using a local, unitary theory of quantum gravity would lead to a logical contradiction.

The theorem is based on the idea that, in a local, unitary theory of quantum gravity, the entanglement entropy of a black hole must be non-negative. This is because the entanglement entropy is a measure of the amount of quantum information that is lost when a region of spacetime is separated from the rest of the universe. Since a black hole is a region of spacetime from which nothing, including information, can escape, it follows that the entanglement entropy of a black hole must be non-negative.

The authors of the paper use a tight-binding model to describe the electronic structure of the junction, which allows them to study the transport properties of the system in the presence of a chiral chemical potential. They find that the differential conductance of the junction as a function of the junction angle is strongly influenced by the chirality of the chemical potential, with a net polarization of cooper pairs being generated via andreev reflection in the two WSM regions.

""Difference-in-differences analysis with a control group that differs considerably from a treated group is vulnerable to bias from historical events that have different effects on the groups. Constructing a more closely matched control group by matching a subset of the overall control group to the treated group may result in less bias. We study this phenomenon in simulation studies. We investigate the impact of mountaintop removal mining (M&RM) on mortality using a difference-in-differences analysis that makes use of the increase in M&RM following the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments. For a difference-in-differences analysis of the effect of M&RM on mortality, we constructed a more closely matched control group and found a 95% confidence interval that contains substantial adverse effects, as well as no effect and small beneficial effects."

The word ""side hustle"" has its roots in popular African American newspapers of the 1920s, where it referred to some kind of scam. By the 1950s, it was used to describe legitimate work as well.
