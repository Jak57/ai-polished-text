Last night, Bethany and I stayed up until after 3:00am watching movies. We've been watching a lot of movies lately. Last night, we watched ""Thirteen"" - a movie every mother of a teenager should see. It was better than I expected. Then we watched ""Gigli,"" and yeah, it was just as bad as the media said it was, but we had to see for ourselves."

Jonothan Antin wants to build a second salon in Beverly Hills, but as I flipped channels, I caught him excitedly declaring, 'I'll build the greatest salon ever!' I was hooked, not since Rocco have I found such a moron compelling TV."

I also learned how surprisingly sweet total strangers can be for no reason other than to be kind. Trust me, it wasn't like they were trying to get into my pants or anything. I had kid drool all over me and was wearing my 'wash-day' outfit... Also, I'm not sure I'll ever be bathing again, so there was no olfactory incentive there! I am currently composing this post and watching the Collected No Doubt videos. I am doing both of these things sitting at my desk in my room."

However, I realized it would be more practical to return the computer to its owner. *chuckles* No rest for the weary, I guess."

So, after the bizarre lunch, my confidence was shaken, and I forgot to tell you all an important part of the story. Before Pat shows up to lunch, Dustin starts talking about what a nice guy Pat is and how he's trying to find a girlfriend for him. I'm listening and nodding, realizing that we're discussing more about finding Dustin's best friend, a girl, than discussing whatever it is we're doing with a stranger over pink lemonade. I excuse myself to the bathroom and silently ask myself: am I being pawned off on the other guy? Is this what happens now?"

Two problems with the scenario outlined in my previous post: Firstly, while Bush's tax cuts may have stimulated the economy in the short term, they have created a long-term debt hangover that could have been avoided with different tax cuts targeting low- and middle-income individuals.
2. Moreover, the Republicans cannot be given control only in times of war because they have cleverly crafted an endless, global ""war on terrorism"" that provides a pretext for their political agenda."

Came home at like quarter to 12 and woke up the next morning at quarter to 7 for a meet. Got there a little late, but it's all good, I did my full-on floor and didn't fall, second on floor and vault, and third on beam, 29.45 all around, which isn't bad because my meets get better as the season goes on."

Tonight, Andy beat me by a few small dollars and won the faroquin game, or maybe I let him win on account of him leaving in a few short hours and me wanting him to feel good on his last night here. Well, however the story goes, it can't compare to this Texas-sized headache I have at the moment. I've taken some Aleve and I must say, they are doing the trick.

God has been doing so much in my life lately and it's been great. I've turned over a new leaf, I guess, and it's been awesome. We arrived at the Twiggs' house on Friday evening and we didn't leave until Monday. Most of what we did was go to the fair, church, a parade, and watch movies."
16,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,blog,"As I lay in bed, half-asleep, my mother's voice pierced through the darkness, calling my name at around eight in the morning. I groggily opened my eyes, trying to make sense of the time, but it was still dark, and I couldn't see anything. I was disoriented and confused, unsure of what time it was or what day it was. My mother's voice was the only thing I could hear, echoing in the darkness, telling me something about the weather in Calcutta. It had been raining for three days, she said, and I felt a wave of exhaustion wash over me. I lay there for a few moments, trying to shake off the sleep and make sense of the situation. Despite the confusion, it was a nice morning, with a gentle drizzle falling from the sky."
17,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,blog,"Last night was the worst. I threw away the sweater I was knitting because it had too many stitches and the mohair was knotting together as I knitted. Despite my best efforts, frogging (ripping out rows) didn't help, and the yarn broke a lot. I didn't even swear, which is unusual for me. I just morosely watched two seasons of Sex and the City instead and then threw the sweater away. I suppose I learned something from the experience, but it wasn't exactly a productive or enjoyable one."
18,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,blog,"Last night in class, we discussed the assigned reading, ""Getting Back into Place: Toward a Renewed Study of the Place-World,"" by Edward S. Casey. The first chapter explores the concept of ""implacement"" and the second, ""displacement."" Casey argues that our contemporary world and culture revolve around time as the central organizing principle, with a focus on the finite nature of time and the need to make the most of it. He contends that placing place at the center of culture can foster a more grounded community. So far, this book has been the most engaging read of the semester."
19,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,blog,"Whatever it is they put into freeze, pops to make them those colors, there should be some sort of warning: may make your life a bit bizarre. And while giggling is good, one wonders if we would have found ourselves up that fire escape, drinking beer in the fierce wind had we not been eating them earlier. Finding ourselves in a doorway to a bar, sadly closed for business, we stopped to examine an office-supplies catalog that had arrived in the post. Lucky we did. Who could possibly have guessed that within these pages were the special offers of a lifetime? Not I, for certain. I list but a few: buy 36 permanent marker pens, get a stunt kite. Buy 30 lever arch files, get a barbecue."
20,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,blog,"Currently listening to: The Little Drummer Boy by Stevan Pasero...and now my post...Senate Republicans, hands up - who watched the 39-hour judicial nominations marathon last week? I know I didn't. Well, okay - I did tune in once or twice. The entire colossal waste of time was perpetrated by Republicans trying to score political points by holding a multi-day cry-fest. Never mind the fact that Democrats have already approved 168 of Bush's judicial nominees - nooo, that's not good enough for the power-mad Republicans who are for some reason laboring under the misapprehension they have a huge mandate for this kind of nonsense."
21,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,blog,"This was a good weekend. I did a lot of good reading, after a long time, I listened to a lot of music (something I should have started doing much earlier) and read three books over the weekend - Bruce Sterling's Heavy Weather, Larry Niven's World of Ptavvs, and Octavia Butler's Parable of the Sower. Heavy Weather was a good cyberpunk romp through a near-future USA, devastated by global warming and general anarchy. While it was clever, well-paced, and vividly etched, I failed to come away with any really significant sensations about the story or the characters. Not that both aren't well-constructed and etched - it's a good book, but not a great one, I guess."
22,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,blog,"Since returning from practicum, I've been struggling to process the aftermath. However, as the second week has passed, the smoke has started to clear, revealing a hidden epidemic that was previously overlooked. Post-practicum trauma has affected many students, including myself, and it's only now that we're starting to come to terms with it. I was able to release my burden by meeting with the course coordinator, which prevented another student from experiencing the same difficulties. Yesterday, I encountered another classmate who was determined to share their frustration with someone who was due to go to their practicum school next. I calmed them down and advised them to speak to the administrator first."
23,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,blog,"Well, things are incredibly busy here at times...but there's always time for supposed stress-relieving activities. I've found that I'm not very good at 8-ball or ping pong, and Rick (the Canuck) always beats me. We have a ping pong table in the front lobby of our building, and I try to squeeze in a quick game whenever I can. Last night, I participated in an 8-ball tournament at the hot spot (our recreation tent with a popcorn machine, TVs, jukebox, DVD rentals, pool table, dart board, and ping pong table). Despite scratching on the eight ball, I still had a good time, and I enjoyed the two Dutch soldiers who joined in the tournament."
24,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,blog,"Fall 1974: I was attempting to fight my way through the second chapter of my high school algebra book for the 13th time. I was not then nor am I now a math person. I hate math. I am math phobic. You get the picture. So, as I struggled to make sense out of algebra, the doorbell rang. I put down my book and went to open the door. No one was there. Great. I returned to my studies and just as I was finding a little glimmer of understanding buried in my subconscious, the doorbell rang again. Bam, just like that, my breakthrough disappeared. I went to the door and, just as before, no one was there. Just what a struggling math student needs, an uninvited practical joker."
25,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,blog,"The text has a total of 35 words. Here is the polished version of the text with 6 words changed ""This past week has been exhausting. I spent Tuesday through Thursday moving to my new classroom. The new room is bigger and closer to my grade level team, which is what I needed to consider as I spent hours preparing my room for this year. If I had known I was moving before the end of the school year, I would have discarded much of the books and supplies I no longer use. Unfortunately, it all came with me, so this week was spent moving, unpacking, and purging excessively. I have to thank my teammate Jill for helping with all of this. She was still teaching this month in my old room, so she and her students moved almost all of my belongings for me!"

Even if I never carried you child, even if I was never married to you, even if I was never an official pair to you... I loved you immensely, and to this day the feeling carries an echo through my heart. Forever will I always be reminded of the very few nights we spent together, hearts and limbs entwined in a soul-embrace, drenched in the salty darkness of an evening by the beach... Or a kiss under the rain. Whenever I get the feeling of a dark glass puncturing my heart, you will be there. That piece of you... Bleeding the eternal love that once lived in me...

27,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,blog,"I'm uncomfortable with investigative reporting. It seems wrong to me. Or, to rephrase that, the article I'm working on and its consequences are not exactly something I'm comfortable with. Perhaps it's because I don't believe in it enough, or I can't really get the full feel for it. The angst behind it. The full-out passion towards it to question. I've grown up in a country where you don't ask questions. Really, you just don't. They shoot you for that shit. They put you in jail with all these internal security acts. I'm not used to this freedom of speech...not used to questioning out loud. Sure, I'm not the easiest person to get along with."
28,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,blog,"We had an outing yesterday with my co-workers at the bank. We went to Guintubdan, La Carolota. It was the first time for most of us. We trekked for the falls, a 30-minute walk. We were all catching our breaths. Whew! but we made it. The water was chilly ice. You could feel your body getting numb due to the coldness. We only stayed less than an hour because we headed for the nearby waterfalls. Another 30 minutes of trekking. The trip was worth it because the falls looked calming and the whole scene was indeed breathtaking. It was like communing with nature. Soaking myself in the cold water was like being one with mother earth. The cold air and water were enough to lull me to sleep."

So we have a month left before Ed leaves. I think it's starting to sink in with Ed, and with all of us. I think it sunk in with me a long time ago. I just hope Ed will be here for Bailey's surgery.

There's nothing better than seeing the excitement on a child's face. After egg hunting, we all went to church. Although the Easter Bunny is fun and all, we make sure our kids understand the true meaning of the holiday. This was Megan's first Easter, and she looked adorable in her jean dress and stockings."

44,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,blog,"I found the idea of flag-burning as a way out of being ostracized as a witch intriguing. As a non-American blogger, I've been hesitant to join the debate, particularly regarding flag-burning, but since I've started writing about it (the topic, not the act), I might as well say something. Firstly, I believe that having a law against flag-burning is utterly nonsensical. When you grant a symbol automatic reverence and protection, you're taking a small but significant step towards totalitarianism. Symbols are fleeting and subjective; their meaning is derived from how they are perceived, not inherently from their physical form. Burning a flag may be seen as a form of protest or a way to express disdain, but it is not a violent act. It is a constitutionally protected form of free speech, and as such, it should be respected."

A digital game should be fun with friends, not a 1v1 grind against the computer or random opponents. The lack of social features and the daily cap on gold earnings make it a chore to play.

I dislike pre-quels as they go against the natural progression of storytelling. While they offer more storywise, the combat feels sloppy and doesn't feel as sharp as Arkham City. As of writing this review (10/26/2013), a game-breaking bug prevents a side mission from being completed (main story is unaffected). Some gadgets are assigned to absurd hotkeys, making it difficult to access them in combat. While it may seem insignificant, this can cause issues in the heat of the moment."

The boss fights are awesome, weapons feel very nice (although not as good as D44m's ones, but still solid), and enemies aren't too spongy (if you're not too much of a retard with handling elemental and upgrade stuff). The upgrade system is really balanced and once you get around it, it's not too tedious. The elemental stuff and limited ammo softly forces you to use different weapons. Lots of cool unique weapons that stay viable throughout most of the game. The music is great, especially the main theme, and of course, Stan Bush's stuff."

My player is an outside scorer, PG, 1.71m, has maxed stats, and got all necessary perks. Okay, and now tell me, why the shooting skill depends on a person's height? Why can't someone with 1.74m become as good in shooting as someone with 1.71m? I'm 1.87m in real life and noticed then that I can't reach a higher skill than 89. Why? That's pure discrimination! And why doesn't the game tell me this before I create a character and not even then when I reach the skill limit after weeks of playing?!"
101,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"I completely agree with you! It's great to have a diverse cast of characters in a game, especially when they are well-developed and meaningfully incorporated into the gameplay. It can add a lot of depth and replayability to the game when you have a variety of characters to play as, each with their own unique abilities and playstyles.



It's also interesting to see how different characters can have different strengths and weaknesses, and how they can complement or contrast with each other. This can create a lot of opportunities for strategic play and replayability, as players can experiment with different combinations of characters and strategies to see what works best for them.
In addition, having a diverse cast of characters can also help to avoid the ""grind"" of playing the same character over and over again, as players can switch things up and try new things with different characters.
Overall, I think having a diverse cast of characters is a great way to make a game more interesting and replayable, and it can help to keep players engaged and motivated."

If you're okay with that, the game can be fun, especially with the Hardsuit and HRV features. I'd rather play this than a Call of Duty title any day, but the pay-to-win model is off-putting. If you're not bothered by it, then go for it, but it's not my cup of tea."
103,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"While not perfect, this game has been greatly enjoyable. The save system and possibility of sudden death leads to some frustration. I'm on my first playthrough and lost my main character around hour 10 of 20ish. Would have really liked a save to reload at that point. I've since picked up a 3rd party mod/save tool to avoid catastrophic failures. Plus the aiming reticule is on the small side and zoom is underpowered. It's been a blast. I'm not normally a zombie fan, but the combination of strategy, missions, first person shooter/beat em up is great. I've been playing it as often as I can get away... Just one more mission, just one more supply run - or I'm running away and want to get safe before shutting the game down."

107,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,game_review,"Yes, this game is a nostalgic blast for those in their 30s who grew up watching the frustratingly annoying Timmy Mallet cartoon. The voice actors for Optimus, Megatron, Bumblebee, and others are back and instantly recognizable. The distinctive cartoon transformation sound effects are also present. The cell-shaded graphics are perfect, and the game's visuals are reminiscent of the classic G1 Transformers cartoon. However, the gameplay is more than just a nostalgic trip. The combat mechanics are well-done, with transforming in the middle of fights being a necessity and seamlessly integrated into combos. It's unlike High Moon's excellent War for Cybertron games, but the focus on melee combat is a nice change of pace. Additionally, some enemies, such as the Seekers, require a switch to a ranged blaster. Overall, it's a fun game that's worth checking out for fans of the franchise and action games in general."

What sets it apart from other RPGs is its unique approach to combat, where you don't have to kill anyone.

On one hand, it's great that the developers are actively working on the game and adding new content to keep it fresh and exciting. However, it can also be frustrating for players who want to see significant changes or new features that are not just minor tweaks and updates.


It's good to know that the game is free to play, so it's worth giving it a try if you're looking for a quick, casual gaming experience. But if you're looking for something more substantial or a longer-term commitment, you may want to wait and see if the game evolves and changes significantly over time."

, it seems like the game is trying to make a point about the polarized nature of politics in the US by limiting the player's options to only two main parties. It's a clever way to poke fun at the idea that people are forced to choose between two extreme sides, rather than considering other perspectives.


I'm glad you're still optimistic about the game! It's important to remember that it's just a game, and it's meant to be fun and entertaining, rather than a realistic representation of politics. It's always okay to take a break from the stresses of real-world politics and have a good time with a game."

In addition, the last level was particularly challenging, with a lot of repetition and a lack of variety in the gameplay.

The World Social Forum (WSF) is a civil society-led initiative that brings together leaders from various fields, including politics, civil society, and the private sector, to discuss and find solutions to global problems. The WSF was established in 2001 and has since been held in different locations around the world, including Davos, Switzerland, where the World Economic Forum (WEF) is also held.

The WSF is distinct from the WEF in that it is not focused solely on economic issues, but rather on a broader range of social, political, and environmental issues. The WSF also has a more inclusive and participatory approach, with a greater emphasis on the involvement of civil society and other stakeholders in the decision-making process.

The authors argue that traditional methods of temporal attention, which rely on human-specified edges, can be both expensive to produce and suboptimal for downstream tasks. In contrast, their proposed approach learns to infer temporal attention by observing the dynamics of node interactions over time.

The authors propose to use temporal point processes to model the probability of a node interacting with its neighbors at different time steps, and variational autoencoders to model the distribution of node features over time. By combining these two components, the model can learn to infer the temporal attention of a node, which can be used for downstream tasks such as node classification, graph classification, and link prediction.
The key contribution of the paper is the introduction of temporal point processes and variational autoencoders for temporal attention in social networks.

We explore these signatures in detail, and find that the EFT uncertainties associated with higher-dimensional operators are uniquely well-suppressed by the construction of an asymmetry variable, which is generated only by these non-interfering operators, relegating the effects of higher-dimensional, interfering operators to the same status as statistical errors in this observable."

The authors use a tight-binding model to describe the electronic structure of the junction, which allows them to calculate the differential conductance and the pairing amplitudes of the junction. They find that the differential conductance and the pairing amplitudes strongly depend on the angle between the junction direction in real space and the axis separating the Weyl nodes in momentum space.

They also identify the influence of a chiral chemical potential, i.e., the electron population imbalance between Weyl nodes of opposite chirality, on the transport characteristics of the junction.

The spin polarization is opposite in the two WSM regions and highly sensitive to the chirality imbalance and excitation energy.

The paper provides a valuable contribution to the field of survey research by bridging the gap between traditional survey estimation methods and Bayesian modeling, and demonstrates the advantages of using Bayesian methods for causal inference in survey research."
239,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"The eccentric debris rings around stars like Fomalhaut and HD 202628 are narrower than expected in the standard eccentric planet perturbation scenario, which assumes a circular and narrow belt of planetesimals at semi-major axis $a$. In a minor variation of this scenario, narrower belts can form if the planetesimals are initially eccentric, which could result from earlier planet perturbations during the gas-rich protoplanetary disc phase. Alternatively, a primordial eccentricity could arise from disc instabilities that increase the disc eccentricity without the need for any planets."
241,hybrid,none,none,polish_5,paper_abstract,"The history of the formation of the Milky Way galaxy is currently being unveiled thanks to the data provided by the $GAIA$ mission. It is likely that the globular cluster system of our galaxy has followed a similarly intricate formation path. To constrain this formation path, we explore the link between the globular clusters and the known merging events that the Milky Way has experienced.

To do this, we combined the kinematic information provided by $GAIA$ for almost all galactic clusters, with the largest sample of cluster ages available after carefully correcting for systematic errors. To identify clusters with a common origin, we analyzed their dynamical properties, particularly in the space of integrals of motion.

Our results show that about 40% of the clusters likely formed in situ."

This article introduces 'intrinsic', an r package with novel state-of-the-art likelihood-based estimators. The package includes three models: two-nn, gride, and hidalgo. These models are categorized into homogeneous and heterogeneous intrinsic dimension estimators. The functions for these two categories cover frequentist and Bayesian frameworks. The hidalgo model is a Bayesian mixture model with an efficient Gibbs sampler."

Two physical rc systems based on a single magnetic skyrmion memristor (msm) and 24 spin-torque nano-oscillators (stnos) were proposed and modeled to process image classification tasks and nonlinear dynamic system predictions. Micromagnetic simulations revealed that a single msm can achieve outstanding performance in handwritten digit recognition, while a physical rc system consisting of 24 stnos can effectively solve complex unknown nonlinear dynamic problems."

In this paper, we reveal a surprising consequence of popularity-based rankings: the fewer items reporting a signal, the higher the collective traffic they attract. This phenomenon, known as the few-get-richer effect, emerges when there are few distinct classes of items and ranking is based on popularity. We demonstrate analytically and experimentally how the effect arises from people's tendency to click on top-ranked items and their diverse preferences for item classes. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the spread of misinformation."

Currently, there are thousands of people on transplant waiting lists waiting for critical organs such as kidneys, hearts, and livers that could save their lives. However, there aren't enough donor organs available to meet this demand. Bioprinting aims to change this by creating brand-new, customized organs from scratch.
Bioprinting is a type of regenerative medicine that involves the use of 3D printing technology to create living tissues. While we are not yet able to print complex organs, researchers have already successfully printed simpler tissues such as blood vessels and tubes that are responsible for nutrient and waste exchange. These tissues have the potential to be used in the creation of artificial organs for transplantation.The process of bioprinting involves the use of a bioprinter, which is a specialized 3D printer that uses living cells as the ""ink"" to create the printed tissue. The bioprinter deposits layers of cells onto a substrate, where they are able to grow and differentiate into the desired tissue. The resulting tissue can then be used to"

Carbon works in a natural cycle, present in all living things: in the soil, in the oceans, and in rocks deep underground. When plants and other living things die, much of their stored carbon makes its way back to the atmosphere, but over millions of years, some of the carbon stored in ancient trees and sea life becomes rock and some becomes fossil fuels: coal, oil, and natural gas. Natural events like volcanic eruptions release some of the carbon trapped in rock. And human activities, like burning fossil fuels, also release some of that prehistoric carbon. Today, humans release around 60 times more carbon than all the volcanoes on the planet each year."
