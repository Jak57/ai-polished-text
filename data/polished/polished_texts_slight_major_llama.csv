We are eagerly anticipating the possibility of receiving the keys at the closing, and I am getting increasingly excited about the prospect of moving in. If everything goes according to plan, we will be able to close on the property by Wednesday of this week. I was up until 3 00 a.m. last night, engrossed in a movie marathon with Bethany. There has been a notable surge in movie nights around here lately. Here's a rundown of the films we've watched  last night, we saw thirteen, a movie that every mother of a teenager should see. It exceeded my expectations, and I would highly recommend it. Then, we watched Gigli, which lived up to its reputation as a cinematic disappointment. Yes, it was just as bad as the media had suggested, but we felt compelled to see it for ourselves."

In recent weeks, I've become enthralled with not one, but two exceptional new shows that have captivated my attention. One such program is a reality TV series that defies convention with a concept so bold, it's almost astonishing. Hairstylist Jonathan Antin, the owner of a renowned salon in West Hollywood, is determined to expand his empire by opening a second location in Beverly Hills. Initially, I wouldn't have given it a second thought, but while channel surfing, I stumbled upon an intriguing scene. Jonathan, exuding an air of narcissism and monotony, stood in an empty space on Rodeo Drive, proclaiming in a loud, public voice, 'I am going to create the greatest salon the world has ever seen!' My curiosity was piqued, and I was hooked. It's been a while since I've found a character as captivating as Jonathan, with his absurd"

The constant strain of moving my arm, particularly when I'm using a mouse on a computer for extended periods, has been exacerbating the condition. The pain is quite debilitating, making it challenging for me to move my arm as much as I'd like. Unfortunately, my recent bout of updating my website and working on other online projects has put a significant strain on my body, leaving me with barely enough strength to engage in any physical activity, including drawing. The lack of sleep has only added to my discomfort, making it a particularly trying time for me. Although I'm not thrilled with my current situation, I'm confident that I'll make a full recovery. My mother's recent surgery has been successful, and her eyesight has shown significant improvement. She can now perceive fuzzy shapes and colors, although she still struggles with her overall vision. I'm hopeful that she'll regain her full vision soon."

It was astonishingly quick how the most mundane tasks can become a daunting ordeal. I was struck by how remarkably kind total strangers can be, simply because they feel inclined to be kind. It wasn't as if they were trying to gain something from me or anything. I had a child's drool all over me and was wearing my 'wash-day' outfit. To make matters worse, I'm not sure I'll ever feel the need to bathe again, so there wasn't even an olfactory incentive there! Currently, I'm accomplishing two tasks simultaneously. I'm composing this post and simultaneously watching the collected no doubt videos. I'm doing both of these tasks from the comfort of my room, seated at my desk."

While I don't mind lending a helping hand, I often find myself pondering the line that separates helping others from being taken advantage of. It's a peculiar phenomenon that has been on my mind lately, especially with the recent late nights spent reading and unwinding. I was looking forward to an early night's rest, but it seemed more practical to prioritize getting this computer back to its rightful owner. *laughs* Alas, no rest for the weary, it seems. Instead, I'm currently engrossed in a rerun of Joe Schmo 2 for the umpteenth time tonight."

After the unusual lunch, my confidence wavered, and I forgot to share an important piece of the story with you all. Prior to Pat's arrival at lunch, Duston began discussing what a wonderful person Pat is and his efforts to find a girlfriend for himself. As I listened attentively, I realized that we were conversing more about finding Duston's ideal partner than discussing any topic with a stranger over pink lemonade. I excused myself to the bathroom, gazed into the mirror, and then silently posed the question to myself  Am I being pawned off to the other guy? Is this the turning point in our interaction?"

I would like each and every individual in the world to take a moment to reflect before rising from bed in the morning, and make a commitment to cultivate mindfulness throughout the day. If they're not prepared to do so, I'd like it if they would reconsider their actions and return to the comfort of their bed, allowing themselves the opportunity to recharge and rejuvenate. I'm exasperated by the prevalence of thoughtless behavior. While I'm not claiming to be the most intelligent individual, I do believe it's reasonable to address the instances of mindless actions. Let's focus on a specific type of behavior for today, and reserve other topics for another time, sound reasonable?"
8,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,blog,"Two significant concerns arise from the scenario outlined in my previous post  1. While the Bush administration's economic stimulus package is stimulating the economy, it is doing so in a way that will ultimately lead to a long-term debt hangover. According to Robert Rubin, the former Treasury Secretary, a more effective stimulus package could have been achieved without incurring long-term debt by implementing targeted, temporary tax cuts that would benefit low- and middle-income individuals. The mention of his name is music to our ears, as he is a respected voice in economic policy. Quickly, can anyone name a Bush administration cabinet official with Rubin's gravitas? Perhaps it will come to us... 2. Moreover, we cannot afford to give the Republicans control only in wartime, as they have ingeniously concocted an endless, global 'war on terrorism' that has become a self-perpetuating excuse for military intervention and fiscal recklessness."

I went to the cove to see Supernova, and they were good as usual; I got to chill with Tiago, and we had a great time. Saturday was a busy day, as I went to work, then out with Joe and Rach, met up with Steve, Tiago, and Tom. I arrived home around quarter to 12 and woke up the next morning at quarter to 7 for a meet. I got there a little late, but it's all good; I did my full-on floor and didn't fall, second on floor and vault, and third on beam, with a score of 29.45, which isn't bad, as my meets tend to get better as the season progresses."

The existential crisis that follows is both humbling and thought-provoking. It's as if you're on the verge of a profound epiphany, only to be interrupted by the harsh reality of your own mortality. And then, in an instant, you're left feeling a mix of emotions - a mix of awe, frustration, and perhaps a dash of embarrassment. Have you ever had that experience? I, for one, detest it. You know what else I detest? Rigid, inflexible schedules. Who, in their infinite wisdom, thought it was a good idea to subject students to the torture of a two-and-a-half-hour class in any subject?

Tonight, I lost a few small bets and won the Faroquet game, or perhaps I let him win because he left in a few short hours, and I wanted him to feel good on his last night here. However, the story can't compare to the Texas-sized headache I have at the moment. I've taken some Aleve, and I must say that they're doing the trick.

Given my limited energy levels, I'll have to be judicious about what I write about. However, I must start by expressing my enthusiasm for camp, which was truly exceptional and exceeded my expectations. God has been blessing me with numerous blessings in my life lately, and it's truly remarkable. I've undergone a transformation, and I'm excited to share my experiences. We arrived at the Twiggs' residence on Friday evening and stayed until our departure for camp on Monday. Our activities primarily consisted of visiting the fair, attending church, a parade, shopping at Walmart, and watching movies."

I have a dentist appointment scheduled for 9 00 AM, which I'm not exactly thrilled about, but I'm willing to get it over with before the start of my surgery rotation. As I'm about to embark on this new journey, I must admit that I'm feeling a sense of nervousness, apprehension, and uncertainty. As a perfectionist, I thrive on excelling in everything I do, but starting anew can be daunting. I'm particularly disheartened by the prospect of feeling like a pawn in the grand scheme, as I've confided to a close friend, Cassie, that I'd rather not be the only one who approaches challenges with a knight's unpredictable moves. The uncertainty of what lies ahead is unsettling, and I'm not looking forward to not being in control."
14,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,blog,"Arun Shourie highlights a significant point, underscoring how the current Governor of Uttar Pradesh, T V Rajeswar, had issued a warning as far back as 1996 about the looming threat of the emergence of a 'third Islamic state' in the subcontinent. As the former head of the Intelligence Bureau and current Governor of Uttar Pradesh, Rajeswar had previously published a series of articles in the Hindustan Times, warning of this dire threat. Shourie raises a pertinent question when he asks, does the fact that we now know that Rajeswar, rather than he or Mr. Advani, wrote these warnings make them more credible? Or does one conclude that, given Rajeswar's repeated warnings, he is a closet communalist and therefore unfit to continue serving as Governor of Uttar Pradesh?"
15,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,blog,"Attitude  indifferent, I'm looking forward to tonight, after a long, grueling day in the trenches here, I'm afraid I haven't had much time to write anything for you readers. However, it's great to see Tigger taking the reins and making an appearance, discussing things that matter. I don't have much to say about yesterday's events, but I did have the pleasure of watching a Shakespeare play on the green, which was lovely. Unfortunately, I had to leave before the curtain closed, which was a bit disappointing. I'm hopeful that someday I'll get to see the entire production. On a separate note, Akcron is correct about the problems with the shower - it's truly frustrating, I have to admit, the look on people's faces when they're torturing themselves can be quite entertaining."
16,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,blog,"I've been overwhelmed with an inexplicable exhaustion for the past two days. The fatigue has been relentless, leaving me feeling utterly drained. Yesterday evening, I returned home, collapsed onto my bed, and slept through the night, only rousing when my mother called me around 8 30 pm. As I slowly came to, it was pitch dark, and I hadn't even bothered to turn on the lights, so for a few disorienting moments, it was just my mother's soothing voice in the darkness, and me struggling to regain my bearings. I couldn't help but wonder why I'm feeling so utterly exhausted... The morning was surprisingly pleasant, with a gentle drizzle outside, a welcome respite from the torrential rain that, I'm told, has been relentless in Kolkata for the past three days."
17,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,blog,"Last night, I had a particularly frustrating experience with my knitting project. I regret to admit that I discarded the sweater I was working on, as it had reached only about 14 inches in length. The yarn, which was worth approximately $10, had become increasingly knotted and tangled, making it difficult to frogging (ripping out rows) and salvage the project. In fact, the yarn broke frequently, which was quite vexing. I must admit that I didn't even curse, which is unusual for me, as I am not one to give in to frustration easily. Instead, I opted to take a break and indulge in a different activity - watching season two of Sex and the City, which I found quite engaging. However, I eventually grew tired of it and, in a moment of exasperation, I discarded the sweater. Despite the setback, I suppose I did learn a valuable lesson from the experience and will approach my next project with a more patient and methodical approach."
18,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,blog,"In our recent class discussion, we delved into the assigned reading, 'Toward a Renewed Study of the Place-World' by Edward S. Casey. The first chapter, 'Implacement,' and the second, 'Displacement,' offered a fascinating exploration of the concepts that shape our understanding of the world. Casey posits that our contemporary culture and society are dominated by the force of time, which he argues is a situating force that drives our daily lives. We are constantly racing against time, trying to make the most of the hours we have, and yet, paradoxically, we are often stuck in the present moment. Casey's central argument is that by placing place at the forefront of our cultural considerations, we can cultivate a more grounded sense of community and belonging. This book has had a profound impact on me, as it is the first reading to have truly resonated with me and sparked a deeper appreciation for the importance of place in shaping our experiences."

While laughter is an excellent coping mechanism, one cannot help but wonder if we would have found ourselves stumbling upon that inferno, sipping beer in the midst of a fierce wind, had we not been indulging in those sweet treats earlier. Finding ourselves at the doorstep of a bar, unfortunately closed for business, we took a moment to peruse an office-supplies catalogue that had arrived in the mail. Fate smiled upon us. Who could have predicted that within these pages lay the extraordinary offers of a lifetime? Not I, for certain. I list but a few  purchase 36 permanent marker pens, receive a stunt kite.

20,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,blog,"I'm currently listening to 'The Little Drummer Boy' by Stevan Pasero. Meanwhile, I'd like to share my thoughts on the recent Senate proceedings. The 39-hour marathon session to confirm judicial nominations was a colossal waste of time. The Republican Senators, frustrated that the Democrats wouldn't rubber-stamp President Bush's judicial appointments without question, resorted to grandstanding and scoring political points. It was a spectacle that was nothing more than a cry-fest. It's astonishing, considering the Democrats have already confirmed 168 of President Bush's judicial nominees. The Republicans' actions are a testament to their power-hungry nature, as they seem to believe they have a mandate to engage in such political posturing."
21,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,blog,"This weekend was a truly rejuvenating experience. After a prolonged period of inactivity, I devoted a considerable amount of time to indulging in my favorite pastime, reading. I made up for lost time by devouring an impressive three books  Bruce Sterling's 'Heavy Weather', Larry Niven's 'World of Ptavvs', and Octavia Butler's 'Parable of the Sower'. 'Heavy Weather' was an engrossing cyberpunk romp set in a dystopian near-future United States ravaged by the devastating effects of global warming and societal collapse. Although it was a well-crafted and engaging novel, I must admit that I failed to derive any profound insights or lasting impressions from the story or its characters. The world-building and character development were commendable, but the narrative ultimately lacked a deeper emotional resonance, leaving me with a sense of 'good, but not great'."

The post-practicum trauma that I had been carrying was only now coming to light. I was initially overwhelmed, but a meeting with the course coordinator allowed me to release my burden, and in doing so, I was able to prevent another student from being stuck with a pedagogically deficient practicum experience. Yesterday, on Monday, I ran into another agitated classmate who was determined to warn a fellow student about the difficulties they would face in the upcoming practicum. I calmed her down and suggested that we should report to the administrator first, together."

I've discovered that I'm not particularly skilled at 8-ball and ping-pong, as Rick, affectionately known as the Canuck, consistently outplays me. Fortunately, we have a ping-pong table in the front lobby of our building, making it easy to squeeze in a quick game whenever I need to unwind. Last night, I participated in an 8-ball tournament at our recreation tent, which is equipped with a popcorn machine, multiple TVs, a jukebox, DVD rentals, a pool table, dartboard, and a ping-pong table. I had a decent run throughout my one entire game, until I accidentally scratched on the eight ball. Despite this mishap, I still had a fantastic time, with the highlight being the two Dutch soldiers who joined the tournament and added to the excitement."

As a self-proclaimed math-phobe, I was dreading the experience. I had already failed to grasp the concepts multiple times before, and I was no closer to comprehension now. The doorbell rang, interrupting my struggles, and I hesitated, wondering if I was being pranked. I put down my book and made my way to the door, only to find no one there. Feeling a mix of relief and annoyance, I returned to my studies, determined to make progress. Just as I was starting to grasp a glimmer of understanding, the doorbell rang once more. My breakthrough was short-lived, as I found myself once again at the door, only to be met with an empty hallway. It was as if the universe was playing a cruel joke on a struggling math student like me."

The new room is spacious and conveniently situated near my grade-level colleagues, which are crucial considerations as I invest countless hours in preparing my workspace for the upcoming year. If I had known I was going to make the move before the end of my school year, I would have discarded a significant portion of the books and supplies I no longer require. Unfortunately, everything came with me. Consequently, this week was spent on the laborious tasks of moving, unpacking, and purging an abundance of unnecessary items. I must express my sincere gratitude to my teammate, Jill, for her invaluable assistance throughout this ordeal. As she was still teaching this month in my old room, she kindly agreed to help me relocate almost my entire room, and her lovely students were equally accommodating in their efforts."

Even if we never had the joy of sharing a child, even if we never exchanged the vows of matrimony, even if our love was never formally acknowledged... I loved you with an all-consuming passion, and to this day, the memory of our love continues to reverberate through my very being. Forever, I will be haunted by the fleeting yet unforgettable moments we shared together - the whispered promises, the tender touch, the unspoken understandings that only came alive in the stillness of those moonlit nights by the ocean's edge... or the sweet surrender of a kiss under the rain. Whenever the ache of longing pierces my heart, I am reminded of those precious hours, when our love was free to flourish, unbridled and wild, and my soul was yours.

The article I am writing and its consequences are not entirely aligned with my values, which is why I struggle to fully immerse myself in the subject matter. Perhaps it's because I lack sufficient conviction, which prevents me from fully embracing it. The underlying emotions and passion behind it are not resonating with me. I've grown up in a culture where questioning authority is not encouraged. In fact, asking questions can be met with hostility and even persecution. I am not accustomed to this freedom of speech, and I am not comfortable expressing my doubts aloud. As someone who is not always easy to get along with others, I find it challenging to navigate these complex issues."

The trek to the falls was a 30-minute journey, during which we all caught our breaths. Upon arrival, we were met with a breathtaking sight  the water was icy cold, and the chill was palpable, making our bodies numb. We spent less than an hour at the falls before continuing on to the nearby waterfalls, another 30-minute trek. However, the excursion was well worth the effort, as the scenery was nothing short of stunning. The tranquil atmosphere and the majestic falls created a sense of oneness with nature, allowing me to feel as though I was communing with the earth itself. The combination of the cold air and water was so soothing that it almost lulled me to sleep."

It's the one thing I didn't get from the Buenviajes, but it's the one thing they all want to indulge in. There are few occasions when I don't mind joining in, but I'd say those instances are relatively rare. With only a month left before Ed leaves, I think it's starting to sink in that Ed will be leaving us soon. I think it's a sentiment that has been brewing with me for a long time. I just hope that Ed will be here for Bailey's surgery. We've been keeping a close eye on his swelling, and there's definitely quite a bit of swelling."

I'm grateful that I brought a bag of eggs along, just in case, and Connor thoroughly enjoyed searching for eggs throughout the park. On Sunday morning, when he woke up, he was absolutely thrilled that the Easter bunny had visited. There's nothing quite like witnessing the unbridled excitement on a child's face. After our egg-hunting adventure, we all attended church, where we emphasized the true meaning of the holiday, even though the Easter bunny is a fun and festive tradition.

I was excited to receive the boots, specifically the Tredair Flame Boots, which I had been eagerly anticipating. However, my excitement was short-lived as I soon realized that I had gotten a flat tire. Fortunately, I was at work, and my colleagues kindly offered to inflate it for me and ensure it held air. If not, they would change my tire and put the spare on it. Thankfully, my spare tire was full-sized.

The OSCE has invited a baker's dozen of congressional Democrats, including four New Yorkers, to petition UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan to dispatch international observers to Florida to oversee this year's presidential ballot. It is worth noting that the OSCE seems to be coming to learn from the U.S. election process, rather than to oversee it, which was the original partisan and childish call for UN."

Just before the new citizens departed, an immigration official, directing the swearing-in, urged them to stop by a voter registration table, where a group of Republican volunteers were handing out voter registration forms.

Just as I could barely blink, my best friend from Florida walked through the door, and that filled me with joy. I missed him dearly. The cherry on top was him bringing his wife along.

44,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,blog,"I find the concept of flag-burning laws to be quite misguided. As a non-American blogger, I've been hesitant to engage in certain discussions, particularly those revolving around the flag-burning debate. However, since I've been drawn into it, I feel compelled to share my thoughts. In my opinion, the notion of automatically bestowing legal protection upon a symbol, regardless of its meaning or perceived significance, is a slippery slope towards authoritarianism. Symbols can be fleeting and context-dependent, and their meaning is often shaped by the way they are perceived or intentionally designed to convey. It's crucial to recognize that symbols, in and of themselves, do not inherently possess inherent meaning; it's the meaning we assign to them that truly matters."

The retelling of the story was decent, but it failed to leave a lasting impression, and I don't feel like I gained anything from watching it. The character development was somewhat lacking, and I thought the score was subpar, and it felt like a knock-off of the Gladiator.

The average implicit commodity from June 2000 through December 2001 is 6.9 cents for deliveries starting September 1, 2000, the average would still be 6.9 cents."

I hope that these daily updates on recent developments are helping you stay informed about what's happening at our company. Here's a summary of the key events from last week  we signed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney, securing $1 billion in additional credit lines. Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets. We have now received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity. Our board of directors elected a new member to the board - William Powers, Jr., the Dean of the University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas."

The order provides for $69 million in potential refunds, either paying up or providing cost justification. Enron was not named as one of the 13 overcharging parties, but PGE was $3.18 million. It's not over yet, though. The order deals only with January 1 and promises further orders regarding December 00 and benchmark prices through April 01. The prices used to determine refunds were fairly high, $273/mwh based on gas prices, emissions costs, and an assumed heat rate of over 16,000. With regards to sales to California, we have concluded at least one short-term sale and have spoken with the California Department of Water Resources about longer-term deals, but we were still struggling with credit issues, last I heard."

Absolutely astonishing, I have nothing but glowing praise for this game, as it has exceeded my expectations and will likely exceed yours too. The fluid movement and bug-free experience have been a highlight, with a plethora of storylines and content to keep you engaged, including multiple practices, events, and even games. My review is based on my personal experience, and I'm thrilled to report that I've had a seamless experience with no major issues. Facescan worked exceptionally well for me, allowing me to earn daily VC. Keep in mind that using the My NBA 2K17 app will enable you to facescan for free and grant you the opportunity to earn daily VC. Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with my experience and would highly recommend this game to anyone."

The wizarding world of digital gaming is a social experience designed for you to enjoy with friends, whether they be friends or frenemies, sharing laughter, witty banter, and competitive gameplay. At its core, the gathering is a game that values community and connection. However, it seems that the wizards of the coast have forgotten this. If you choose to play with friends, you can earn gold, and gold is crucial. Gold is so vital that it's capped daily, considering it unlocks all aspects of the game. But be prepared for a lengthy and potentially monotonous grind against the AI or random opponents, whom you can't even communicate with. If you opt to play for free, it will take you approximately 4 hours a day for upwards of a month, solo, to unlock the cards and unlock the full potential of the game."
98,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"As I delve into the third installment of the trilogy, I will address the unpleasant aspects first. I strongly dislike pre-qualifiers, as they often hinder the narrative's forward momentum, rather than propelling it forward (this is a common issue in pre-quals). While they may provide additional story context, the combat mechanics feel clumsy and lack the finesse of Arkham City's more refined approach. As of the time of writing this recommendation (October 26, 2013), a game-breaking bug persists, which prevents a key side mission from ever being completed (the main story remains unaffected). Some gadgets are inconveniently mapped to a hotkey, requiring an arduous journey across the keyboard to access them. Although it may seem minor, this issue can potentially disrupt combat and even break your combo."
99,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"The Shadow Warrior (2013) is a game that has made significant strides in terms of boss battles, weapon handling, and enemy difficulty. The boss fights are truly exceptional, with weapons that feel incredibly satisfying to wield (although they may not quite match the quality of the D44M weapons, they are still solid options). The enemies are not overly simplistic, requiring a good understanding of elemental weaknesses and upgrade mechanics to overcome. The upgrade system is well-balanced, making it easy to progress without becoming too tedious. The limited ammo and elemental weaknesses of each weapon encourage the use of a diverse arsenal, which is refreshing and adds to the game's replay value. The soundtrack is excellent, with the main theme and Stan Bush's contributions being particularly noteworthy."
101,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"The Assassin's Creed series nailed the mechanics down on all fronts, from ship battles to sailing, hunting, and parkour. I felt a strong emotional connection to this character as well. The story begins rough, but it improves significantly as you progress, much like every other action game I've played. Edward was an intriguing character, as were the supporting characters. I felt that all the collectibles had a meaningful purpose in this game, which I didn't get from any of the previous ones. Perhaps it's because I felt like they had a greater significance in the game. They were not essential, but they were enjoyable to collect and were rewarded in a well-balanced manner."
102,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"While I personally cannot wholeheartedly recommend this game, it wasn't entirely terrible. The gunplay is passable, provided you're willing to invest in purchasing gun parts, which is my primary criticism with this game  it's a pay-to-win model. If I could look past that, the game would be enjoyable, as the hardsuit is fun to use and the HRV system is an excellent concept. I'd choose this game over any Call of Duty title any day, but its pay-to-win microtransactions format is off-putting for me. If you're comfortable with this model, then by all means, have fun. However, if you're like me and dislike pay-to-win games, I would advise against it; it's not my cup of tea."
103,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"While not perfect, this game has been a thoroughly enjoyable experience. However, the save system and the possibility of sudden death can lead to some frustration, particularly during the early stages of the game. I experienced this firsthand when I lost my main character around the 10th hour of my 20-hour playthrough. A save feature to reload at that point would have been greatly appreciated. Fortunately, I've since discovered a third-party mod/save tool to mitigate the risk of catastrophic failures. Additionally, the aiming reticle could be slightly larger and the zoom function could be more powerful. Despite these minor drawbacks, I've thoroughly enjoyed my time with the game. As someone who doesn't typically play zombie-themed games, I've found the combination of strategy, missions, and first-person shooter/beat-em-up elements to be particularly engaging. I've found myself playing it as often as I can get away, often getting sucked into just one more mission or supply run before reluctantly shutting the game down."
104,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"This game is an absolute masterpiece of strategy! Having played every other war game (European Escalation, and Alpha), I have to say that this one stands out. The sheer number of units is impressive. Although I'm not entirely sure how many units there are, there's an astonishing amount. The graphics are stunning, the sounds are fantastic, and the gameplay is epic. The in-game chat box at the main menu is also highly entertaining, I'm not exaggerating. However, if you think this game is 'easy' or if you're new to the strategy genre, it may take some time to master. Don't get discouraged if you lose units - it's all part of the learning process. Just make sure you plan ahead, always have anti-air and anti-tank capabilities to increase your chances of success."
105,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"I was initially skeptical about this game before I played it. I was unsure about purchasing it, especially given the portal gun and portal concept, which seemed unusual to me, despite my appreciation for science fiction. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The humor and voice acting in this game are phenomenal. They are not cheesy, and the different characters have distinct personalities. Each one has a unique sense of humor, which adds to the game's charm. The level design is also impressive, with its unique blend of challenging and fun elements. I never played the first Portal game, but I'm planning to play it soon if I can find the time. In fact, I wouldn't have played it if I hadn't played the sequel, as the experience has made me curious about the original game."
107,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"Embark on a nostalgic journey with this delightful trip down memory lane, as thirty-somethings who grew up in the UK can relive the excitement of watching the ever-iconic Transformers cartoon, featuring the memorable voice acting talents of Optimus, Megatron, Bumblebee, and many more. The distinctive cartoon transformation sound effects are instantly recognizable, transporting you back to a bygone era. Graphically, the cel-shaded presentation is a masterclass in nostalgic charm, exuding a sense of retro flair that is undeniably Generation 1. Beyond its retro aesthetic, the game is an absolute blast, boasting combat mechanics that are nothing short of exceptional. The seamless integration of mid-fight transformations, expertly woven into fluid combos, sets it apart from other Cybertron games. Another notable distinction is the emphasis on melee combat, which is expertly balanced by the inclusion of ranged blasters for those who prefer a more strategic approach, as seen in encounters with formidable foes like the Seekers."
108,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"I recently downloaded the game and spent a brief period playing it, but unfortunately, it failed to impress me. The login process was more time-consuming than the actual gameplay, as I encountered a recurring issue where the ""update to terms of service"" prompt would repeatedly appear, requiring me to restart the client to progress. This is somewhat inconvenient, especially since I was asked to link my Steam and GFace accounts, citing the need for downloadable content (DLC). However, this linking is not reversible, which means that a company I'm not familiar with now has access to my Steam information. In terms of the game itself, I found it to be a noticeable clone of another game, with the added disappointment of subpar gunplay. It's astonishing that the developers managed to make it worse, as it's clear that they had the potential to do better."
109,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"Enjoy a stunning 4K+ experience at 60 frames per second with a GTX 970, accompanied by dual audio options and the inclusion of Neptune Gear. What's not to love? This exceptional port is an excellent entry point for newcomers to the series. Please note that there is some (skippable) dialogue, which may be a consideration for some players. As always, I recommend using a gamepad, but I had no issues with a keyboard and mouse setup, which is fully customizable. The price is reasonable, and I wouldn't have hesitated to make a purchase. Moreover, over half of the DLC is included at no additional cost, providing ample content to enjoy. I highly recommend this game to fans of JRPGs, anime, and visual novels, provided you're willing to tolerate occasional breaks between action sequences. Cheers! For those who prefer commentary-free gameplay, I've created a playlist available here  https //www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSLFVijaUpsZeZ9Af395MvNk63XnHsj1"
110,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"I was impressed by the seamless performance, even at the initial release, and following numerous patches, the game plays exceptionally well. In my opinion, this is a truly exceptional and entertaining game, although the format may be slightly unconventional (where the free-roam city area respawns with new enemies every time you progress through the story). I particularly enjoyed the 'dual play' segments (where you can play as both Batman and Robin), and the ability to use the controller for most parts of the game, while employing the mouse and keyboard for the tank combat segments was greatly appreciated. Driving the Batmobile around the free-roam city, including when pursuing the Arkham City Commanders, is actually quite enjoyable once you master the art of using the brakes to drift around corners (and when you master that, driving around the city is truly quite enjoyable)."
112,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"I'm not a native English speaker, as my native language is Dutch. Please bear with any minor typos or grammatical errors in my review of this fantastic game. I'll break down my review into several categories  Graphics, Controls, Sound, and Replayability. Graphics  The game's visuals are set in a comic-like style, with very detailed and vibrant color schemes. The graphics can be set to 'high' without straining your system's resources. I play this game on an i5 processor with an NVIDIA GeForce 710M graphics card and 8GB of RAM, running Windows 8.1, and it runs seamlessly. Controls  The game can be played using a keyboard and mouse, but it's also compatible with an Xbox controller."
113,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"You can see the countless hours I've invested in this game, and it's clear that I thoroughly enjoy it. This is exactly what I had hoped for in a search game from CD Projekt Red - a game that truly understands the concept of immersion and execution. Don't make the mistake of buying this game thinking it's like Call of Duty, Battlefield, or any other shooter game. It's a game that stands in its own league and deserves to be treated as such. I've lost count of how many new players I've seen complaining about getting killed quickly, only to be met with the same tired 'oh no, I got shot in the face and died' refrain. It's not like that kind of thing happens in real life or anything. After spending a considerable amount of time playing this game, I can confidently say it's one of the best multiplayer games out there. It's a great option to play when you're not in the mood for CS GO."
114,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"I'm two hours in and I'm dying from laughing so hard at this game. The gameplay is solid, the art design is breathtakingly beautiful, the music is surprisingly high-quality and perfectly fitting, the story/world has me thoroughly engaged, and the puzzles are delightfully entertaining. But the most remarkable aspect of this game is its comedy. If you've played any RPG since the dawn of video game RPGs, you'll be in stitches at the numerous jokes, parodies, and references; if you're new to RPGs, you'll still appreciate the game's humor. If you played Final Fantasy VII or X, you absolutely must play this game, without giving away too much - I had to pause my playtime after two hours to give my cheeks a break from laughing and smiling so uncontrollably. What a sheer delight so far."
115,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"I'm truly sorry to say, I was genuinely enthusiastic about supporting free-to-play games and independent developers, but unfortunately, this game failed to meet my expectations. The game's description initially piqued my interest, but the execution fell short in several key areas. As a lover of puzzle and exploration games, I was underwhelmed by the experience, as I found the gameplay to be unnecessarily complicated and frustrating. Moreover, the lack of a pause button was a glaring oversight, particularly given the time-sensitive nature of certain sequences in the game. This oversight made it even more difficult to fully engage with the game, and I often found myself simply sitting idly, waiting for the time to pass. Furthermore, I believe the game is more of a proof-of-concept than a fully fleshed-out game, and I spent a significant amount of time simply waiting for something to happen."
116,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"This game was an absolute masterpiece, from its captivating storyline to its stunning graphics, I was completely enthralled. The narrative was more than just a story; it felt as if I was the protagonist, trying to unravel the mystery that my character was recounting. The gameplay was exceptional, and I discovered a lot about myself through this game - primarily, my fear of heights, which I never previously experienced until the ice caverns. My stomach churned throughout the entire experience, but I persisted, driven by my determination to see what lay ahead, all for Uncle Fred! If you were to create a downloadable content pack or a sequel, I would be the first in line to purchase it and enthusiastically recommend it to everyone I know. A huge thank you to everyone involved in creating this masterpiece, you have crafted a truly breathtaking game."
117,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"Beyond Earth, the latest installment in the Sid Meier's Civilization series, is a turn-based game where you guide your civilization's evolution to achieve a specific objective or 'victory'. Unlike previous games in the series, which spanned the Earth's timeline through various eras such as the Stone Age, Medieval Age, and Modern Era, this game takes a bold leap into the future by setting you on a mission to colonize a new planet. I appreciate the innovative approach taken by the developers, which introduced fresh mechanics such as the Affinity System and Orbital Layer. However, I found that these new mechanics sometimes led to an overwhelming experience. To further enhance the game, I believe that incorporating updated artwork, particularly the environmental elements encountered during interactions with other leaders, could greatly improve the overall gameplay experience."
119,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"It's a shame I can't thoroughly recommend or fully enjoy this game, given the short time I've played it. I know I'd be hooked if it didn't have the following two game-breaking issues. Firstly, the lack of Aussie servers is a major drawback, as one red bar puts you at a severe disadvantage and creates unbearable lag. Moreover, I played through the offline training mode, and it was stuttering and lagging as well - a phenomenon that defies explanation. Coupled with the poor ping, it's just unbearable. Additionally, the game's assets, such as the menus, backgrounds, and in-game graphics, are laughable, with everything appearing as if it's in a state of disarray. I've never experienced this issue with this card before, and I thought it might not be compatible with my graphics processing unit. I set my GPU back to stock settings, and, sure enough, it didn't make a difference."
120,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"The recently completed game was a satisfying experience. Although the story may not have been particularly complex or captivating, the narrative's engaging atmosphere and numerous collectibles effectively brought it to life. I gained valuable insight into the world of Batman, although I was slightly underwhelmed by the limited number of boss battles. Fortunately, there are promising future games that will likely rectify this. The combat, while not overly challenging, strikes a good balance between accessibility and difficulty. Leveling up Batman was not overly fulfilling, but the gadgets and upgrades I acquired during the campaign added a welcome layer of depth to the gameplay. Gaining access to previously inaccessible areas was a satisfying aspect of the game, providing a sense of progression and accomplishment."
121,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"To venture to the moon is no mere escapism... Nay, it's a transcendent experience, and it was one of the most profound and exhilarating experiences of my life to date. Think Telltale's The Walking Dead is sad? Ah, it's no match for the moon! Never before have I been so deeply moved and fulfilled by something purely fictional. This masterpiece represents the apex of storytelling in my opinion, and the soundtrack is a ravishingly charming and perfect accompaniment. Yes, the controls can be a bit finicky, and the gameplay is not the strong suit, but the story is so captivating that I didn't care one bit. Moreover, the humor is expertly woven throughout, never intruding upon the distinguished nature of the narrative. And the doctor's references are endless, adding a layer of depth and complexity to the already rich tapestry of the game."
122,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"The bastion is a remarkably brilliant game, boasting a captivating storyline. Following a catastrophic event, you begin to rebuild on the bastion, with a plethora of choices available to you, including the selection of which structures to construct for a strategic advantage, which weapons to wield, and what power-ups to equip on those weapons, as well as which elixirs to consume for a bonus effect. The artistic style and soundtrack in the game are exceptional, rendering everything visually stunning at times, making it difficult to imagine a more apocalyptic setting. Moreover, the game features a narrative that is heavily influenced by the player's actions, so if you opt to pick up a weapon and subsequently switch to another in the armory, the narrative will reflect your decision, describing your choice of weapon as you move forward."
123,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"I had initially acquired this game in its early development phase, when the primary currency was spacebux, and there was no 'tech tree' in place. During this period, I found the game to be enjoyable. All the weapons at this stage were equally overpowered, resulting in a lack of balance; anyone could eliminate anyone at any moment. Additionally, the game initially provided unlimited gun slots and five loadouts. One might assume that, given the vast array of 'bajillions of guns', the developers would have offered more than six weapon slots and three loadouts before requiring additional payment. In reality, I had amassed a collection of approximately three pages worth of firearms, and was exploring new ideas for expansion, as I found it most enjoyable when I had a surplus of options. This experience led me to believe that the game's developers could have done better in terms of providing a more balanced gameplay experience."
124,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"This game was a delightful surprise. The reviews of certain products are often misleading, but in this case, the reviews accurately reflect the enjoyable experience of this charming game. It's an intriguing blend of a classic 2D platformer and a MOBA, executed with style. I found myself growing attached to characters I wouldn't typically enjoy in other MOBA games. Initially, I was skeptical about the melee tank, but was pleasantly surprised by the outcome and ended up trying out more characters as they became available through playing games. The art style and interface are delightfully charming. As a result, I now use one of the characters as my avatar and a wallpaper from creating a card set for the game."
125,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"I've recently discovered a captivating game that has consumed me for hours on end, completely immersed in its immersive atmosphere. The audio design, including the music and sound effects, perfectly complements the gameplay, while the controls are finely tuned to provide a seamless experience. Each combat encounter is a thrilling experience, and the ability to engage in simultaneous battles with multiple fleets is a game-changer. Initially, I had some reservations about the naval combat system, but I've found it to be an exhilarating aspect of the game. The only way to succumb to defeat is to fail to retreat and regroup, regroup, and counter-assault. The developers have done an outstanding job in crafting an experience that is both engaging and addictive."
126,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"The reboot of the Devil May Cry franchise has brought about a significant transformation for the series, particularly for its protagonist, Dante. While fans of the original series may be disheartened by the change to their beloved character, it is undoubtedly for the better; and this new game by Ninja Theory proves it. DMC serves as the ideal point for newcomers to jump into the series. It showcases the origins of an arrogant, cynical Dante, and it chronicles his journey from cynicism to selflessness. Throughout, the game weaves a clear, narrative arc for the new Dante, making him a compelling character to follow. The story follows Dante as he's introduced into the corrupt world he willfully chose to ignore, presenting a complex and thought-provoking tale that explores the complexities of human nature."
127,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"Where do I start on this captivating game, which is an absolute delight? The story is an enchanting tale, overflowing with meticulous attention to detail, and overflowing with joy, witty humor, and endearing quirks. It strikes a perfect balance between seriousness and playfulness, effortlessly weaving together poignant moments with humorous ones. The character designs are expertly crafted, with a diverse array of characters boasting unique personalities and intriguing backstories. What sets this game apart from others is its refreshing departure from the typical RPG formula, where you're not forced to engage in violence or combat, which is a welcome departure from the norm in the RPG genre. Drawing inspiration from the esteemed Earthbound, one of the most exceptional RPGs I've had the pleasure of playing, it's clear that this game is destined to be a standout. The soundtrack is, without a doubt, one of the most memorable and captivating I've had the pleasure of experiencing."
128,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"I am recommending this solely because it's free, and it may be a more enjoyable experience for others. As for my experience, the game didn't resonate with me. Half the story relies heavily on shock value, and I didn't find myself emotionally invested in the narrative. Perhaps I'm desensitized, or maybe it was too simplistic to elicit a reaction from me. The other half of the game attempts to paint a vivid picture of a person's mental decline, exploring themes such as obsession, hallucinations, depression, and other related issues. While the concept is intriguing, I found the experience to be underwhelming, taking around 10 minutes to complete, which is excessive considering the amount of information presented. Despite this, I appreciate the game's attempt to tackle complex themes, but I didn't find it to be a particularly impactful or engaging experience."
129,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"Here is a polished version of the original text:

""Is it really necessary to elaborate on why Portal is an extraordinary game? Portal is a puzzle game that initially presents a concept and then gradually unfolds. It is an innovative way to challenge your cognitive abilities while still being an entertaining experience. Although this game may not have a rich narrative, it gave rise to one of the most beloved games of 2011. I still enjoy playing this game and return to it when I'm feeling underwhelmed and I relish the opportunity to revisit the puzzle-solving experience and see what contributed to its legendary status. Gameplay: Portal's gameplay is surprisingly straightforward, yet deceptively complex. You utilize portals to your advantage, along with buttons that activate specific puzzle elements. Two buttons are present in the game, one that you press and one that requires a cube to be applied."

If you're in the market for a space exploration game, I can wholeheartedly recommend this setup. Since most reviews focus on technical specifications, I'll provide my own  i5-6600k processor, Radeon RX 480 graphics card, Z170 Pro gaming monitor, 16GB DDR4 RAM, and a total budget of approximately €650. While this setup is on the higher end of the medium price range, it's still a relatively new system. Notably, I achieved a consistent 60+ frames per second on high settings with vsync enabled, which is a testament to the capabilities of this rig. I'm astonished that 90% of the comments claim they're running an overkill setup and still achieving only 20 frames per second."

Divinity  Dragon Commander reaches awfully close to the borders of my personal most favorite RTS game. Combine this with a massive, risk-like grand strategy mode, and it hits the spot. I'm not (read  try not to be) overly biased due to the fact that this game allows you to transform into a dragon, aiding your troops by supporting, attacking, and even commanding unit production, direction, and spawning at the very same time. Honestly, I do like the complex RTS games nowadays. Think of Civilization V and so on. However, such games attempt to cram complex mechanics, charts, and resources all into one complicated game mode."

The graphics and music harmonize perfectly, crafting a nostalgic atmosphere that elevates the overall experience. The script masterfully navigates a wide range of emotions, effortlessly blending comedy, drama, heartbreak, and hope, often converging these elements in a single moment. This masterful storytelling approach turns RPG tropes on their head, creating a truly impactful and unforgettable experience. While the game's world, characters, story, and gameplay mechanics are all noteworthy, I could write an exhaustive analysis of each. Instead, I'll simply say this  if you're a fan of RPGs, you owe it to yourself to play this game. If you're a gamer, you won't want to miss this experience. If you have seven free hours before your mortality, seize the opportunity to indulge in this remarkable game."

The developers are incredibly active in the community, and it's evident in the various discussion forums and developer diaries. The game's mechanics can be complex, with a steep learning curve that I'm still navigating; however, this depth of strategy offers a multitude of ways to achieve goals and capitalize on specific situations. In my opinion, the game is almost infinitely replayable. I find myself becoming completely absorbed in every session I play, regardless of how the playthrough unfolds."

However, as the hours pass, the repetitive nature of the combat, enemies, and gameplay becomes apparent. The redeeming factor is the dedication of the developers, who consistently release regular updates that introduce significant changes, new warframes, and other improvements to the game's systems. This dedication ensures that the game remains enjoyable for casual players. While it may not retain its appeal beyond a few months for dedicated players, it is a worthwhile experience worth trying out. As a bonus, the game is free, making it an accessible option for those seeking a quick fix or a casual gaming experience."

I was underwhelmed by my purchase of this game, which I thought was a PC version of 'Katamari Damacy', a popular and charming PS2 game. Unfortunately, it falls short of my expectations. In this game, you find yourself absorbing increasingly massive objects to grow larger and absorb even more enormous entities. However, the gameplay is marred by rough edges, with levels that lack imagination and a surreal horror show that leaves you questioning the meaning of existence. I don't mean a thrilling horror show, but one that leaves you feeling melancholic and makes you wonder if being alive is all it's cracked up to be. Every living creature in this game, from small pets to human beings, raises the question whether the creators of this game have an interest in taxidermy."

I was very intrigued when I first heard about this game, thinking, 'Wow, a simulator of the road to becoming president! That sounds exciting!' However, it didn't quite live up to my expectations. The game starts by asking you to choose a side  Republican or Democrat, with no option for an independent or third party. A little disappointed, but still optimistic, I decided to continue playing to see what I could do. I will give the game credit, the character customization, although limited, is quite enjoyable to play around with. It's the only time it's an option to wear your head or not in a campaign.

Some features are hardcoded and cannot be rebound. Bugs are abundant. My Pip-Boy disappeared permanently at one point, and I had to research console commands to recover it. You don't have to work for power armor; it's essentially given to you from the beginning of the game, and power cores are abundant in trader shops. The value of power armor has diminished significantly from previous Fallout games. The story is mediocre, with everything about this game being average, except that it doesn't crash every 10 minutes like Fallout 3. Compared to Fallout 3, it's relatively stable. While it's not better than Fallout 3, it's not terrible either. This title was overhyped for how mediocre it actually is."

During this time, I managed to collect 10 out of 25 collectibles and earn zero achievements out of 15. What I enjoyed most about the game was the visuals, which remained engaging until the very end, particularly the ice caves level. While the story wasn't particularly impressive, the conclusion after the credits was satisfying enough to make me feel like I didn't regret spending my time playing this game. On the other hand, the visuals in the final level were underwhelming, and the gameplay became frustratingly repetitive in its repetition, making it a chore to complete. Furthermore, the achievements were excessively challenging, with only 13 (out of 15) achieved by less than 2.1% of players, making it a challenging experience for many players."

One major issue is the numerous bugs, particularly in the environment, which can cause frustration when you get stuck or your shots hit an invisible wall despite having a clear line of sight on the enemy. Another issue is the handholding/babysitting nature of the game, which can be annoying. The AI is also quite dumb, making it easy for enemies to locate you when you're spotted. The enemy's accuracy is almost godlike, which can be frustrating, similar to the first Ghost Warrior. Additionally, the checkpoints and save system are subpar. The story is also underwhelming, and I found it difficult to care about it. Unless it's 90% off, I wouldn't recommend it. Even then, playing this game feels like an extremely boring chore, and I only play it to finish it to move on to the next game in my library. Considering the time I wasted on the first Ghost Warrior, which was equally underwhelming, I probably won't play this game until the end."

One thing I have is a preference for more immersive, room-scale gaming experiences with controllers. Beyond the game's awe-inspiring universe scale, I felt that same scale hindered my enjoyment. The learning curve and the time required to do anything engaging at the beginning were too steep for me. Perhaps if I were more patient and had more time to dedicate to gaming, this might be more appealing to me. However, I lack the luxury of time and there are numerous other VR games I'd rather devote my time to."
144,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,game_review,"Hands down, my favorite first-person shooter of all time. The need for run-and-gun rambos is a thing of the past. Recoil and ballistics are remarkably realistic. Single hits to the chest, neck, or head from rifle-caliber weapons almost always result in death unless it merely grazes you. Rounds drop over distance and short, controlled bursts are essential if you wish to maintain a steady aim. There is no magical ammunition pool. If you reload halfway through your magazine, you'll find yourself with a pouch full of half-full mags. You can't sustain a sprint indefinitely. If you sprint for a while, your aim will suffer as you gasp heavily until you've caught your breath. Rest your weapon on your elbows while prone or on a windowsill to steady your aim. Accuracy suffers when standing, as the human body is not designed for sustained, prolonged periods of rapid movement."

I never experienced the issues that some players claim to have encountered with that game. I thoroughly enjoyed the game, despite its unforgiving nature in the early stages, which only made it more rewarding when I executed actions correctly. As for XCOM 2, I have a strong affection for it, and the game runs smoothly on medium settings on my system, which consists of a GTX 560 with 2GB of video RAM. Initially, the game was set to high settings, which resulted in a slightly sluggish performance, but not to the extent that it became unplayable. However, when I adjusted the settings to medium, the game ran smoothly without any issues. I'm not sure if I'm simply fortunate when it comes to avoiding problems with games or if it's a matter of circumstance, but it appears that most of the negative reviews seem to stem from an entitled mentality among some players."

While the game may have some drawbacks, such as limited equipment options and a non-branching leveling system, it still offers a fun and engaging experience. The game starts off quickly and maintains a steady pace, making it easy to get into the action. The variety of ships and skills to unlock keeps things fresh and exciting, and the game's ability to be modded adds a whole new level of replayability. The combat is the main attraction, but the addition of challenging battles against powerful enemies is also a major draw.

The Scottish midfielder himself scored the second goal when he met Saul Mikoliunas' precise cross at the back post, securing the win for the home side. Craig Easton headed in a contentious goal after an hour, but Hearts held their lead. The opening goal came after Gus Bahoken's clumsy foul on Miller from 35 yards out, allowing McAllister to float the free kick into the Livi box, where Miller outjumped the static visiting defense to loop his header from 10 yards over Meldrum. With just 10 minutes on the clock, the home side doubled their lead, with McAllister's pace and precision proving too much for the visitors to handle.

However, the effectively linear interaction between motion and light or electricity precludes access to the broader class of quantum states of motion, including cat states or energy squeezed states.

Unfortunately, these evaluations can be compromised by professional spammers who employ sophisticated and ever-evolving spamming tactics to evade detection. The spamming strategies are notoriously difficult to detect, as they can rapidly adapt to new detection methods, target various products, and remain largely unknown in most cases. Furthermore, existing detectors often prioritize detection accuracy over the trustworthiness of product evaluations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel game-theoretic approach where spammers and spam detectors engage in a dynamic competition with each other, driven by practical goals that are not solely focused on detection accuracy. The resulting Nash equilibria of this game lead to robust detectors that are agnostic to any mixed detection strategies, thereby promoting a more trustworthy and resilient review ecosystem."

Among this family, we identify a tracking solution with a single parameter to control simultaneously the fidelity of the transfer, the population of the excited state, and robustness. We define a measure of the robustness of an ultra-high-fidelity transfer as the minimum percentile deviation on the pulse areas at which the infidelity rises above 10^-4.

We demonstrate that all local minima share the same form of structure, which partially identifies the component centers of the true mixture. Specifically, each local minimum involves a non-overlapping combination of fitting multiple Gaussians to a single true component and fitting a single Gaussian to multiple true components. Our results apply to the setting where the true mixture components satisfy a certain separation condition, and remain valid even when the number of components is over- or under-specified. For Gaussian mixtures with three components, we obtain sharper results in terms of the scaling between the components, with a notable improvement in the separation between the components."

By employing a high-order MVS scheme, we enable the integration of large time steps, even in the presence of distant close encounters. We demonstrate the efficacy of this algorithm in resolving almost exact collisions, with a mutual separation of a fraction of the physical radius, using the same time-step as in weakly perturbed systems, such as the solar system. Our long-term simulations of six super-Earths experiencing strong scattering over 50,000 years reveal the stability and accuracy of our approach.

One widely employed tool for detecting entanglement is the entanglement witness, which guarantees a positive measurement outcome for separable states and can yield a negative result for certain entangled states. However, as the Hilbert space dimension exponentially increases with respect to the system size, constructing an efficient entanglement witness for general multipartite entangled states becomes increasingly challenging. For $n$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-like states, the most robust witness scheme necessitates $n+1$ local measurement settings and can tolerate up to $1/2$ white noise. In contrast, the most efficient witness for GHZ-like states requires only two local measurement settings and can withstand up to $1/3$ white noise, demonstrating a significant reduction in the number of measurement settings required for entanglement detection."

These latter can break the axial and equatorial symmetry of the Kerr metric, revealing a much richer multipolar structure, which provides a gateway to constrain fuzzball models phenomenologically. Our findings demonstrate that all multipole moments are typically larger in absolute value than those of a Kerr black hole with the same mass and spin.

Specifically, the restriction homomorphisms between the orthogonal, unitary, and symplectic groups of adjacent dimensions are naturally split epimorphisms. The interest in this splitting stems from equivariant stable homotopy theory. The equivariant stable homotopy groups of every global spectrum form a global Mackey functor, so the splittings imply that certain long exact homotopy group sequences decompose into short exact sequences. For the real and complex global Thom spectra $\mathbf{mo}$ and $\mathbf{mu}$, the splittings imply the regularity of various Euler classes related to the tautological representations of $o(n)$ and $u(n)$.

Furthermore, we develop an emulator to enable fast predictions of the baryonic power suppression, allowing us to perform a likelihood inference analysis for a standard LCDM cosmology with both cosmological and astrophysical parameters."
213,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"In order to analyze spontaneous conversations in real-world settings, such as those found in child-centered recordings, we have discovered that these types of audio files are amongst the most challenging to process. However, developing speech processing models capable of handling such a wide range of conditions would be particularly valuable for language acquisition studies, where researchers are interested in the quantity and quality of the speech that children hear and produce, as well as for early diagnosis and measuring the effects of remediation. In this paper, we present our approach to designing an open-source neural network to classify audio segments into vocalizations produced by the child wearing the recording device, vocalizations produced by other children, adult male speech, and adult female speech. We have gathered diverse child-centered corpora, which totals 260 hours of recordings and encompasses 10 languages."
214,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"The density-based clustering approach relies on the concept of grouping data points according to specific features of the underlying probability distribution. By referencing an unknown, true population structure, we can frame the clustering problem in a standard inferential framework, where the notion of ideal population clustering is defined as the partition induced by the true density function. The non-parametric formulation of this approach, known as modal clustering, establishes a correspondence between the clusters and the domains of attraction of the density modes. Operationally, a non-parametric density estimate is required, and the proper selection of the amount of smoothing, governing the shape of the density and hence the modal structure, is crucial to identify the final partition. In this work, we address the issue of density estimation for modal clustering from an asymptotic perspective, providing a comprehensive understanding of the underlying statistical principles and their application to the clustering problem."
215,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"The sensitivity of diboson production at the LHC to the interference between the standard model and higher-dimensional operators, parameterizing the effects of heavy new physics, is a crucial aspect of diboson phenomenology. However, the helicity selection rules for diboson scattering amplitudes impose an obstruction to the naive interference contributions of dimension-six operators, leading to a cancellation of the total diboson rate correction. In this scenario, carefully measuring the azimuthal decay angles effectively resurrects the interference, recouping sensitivity to the non-interfering operators. We thoroughly investigate these signatures in detail and find that the EFT uncertainties associated with higher-dimensional operators are uniquely well-suppressed by the construction of an asymmetry variable, which is solely generated by these non-interfering operators. Consequently, the effects of higher-dimensional, interfering operators are relegated to the same status as statistical errors in this observable, rendering them negligible."
216,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"Data science, as a field, aims to extract causal inferences from observational data, a goal shared by many in the health and social sciences. However, traditional academic statistics has historically been skeptical of data analysis with a causal objective. The introduction of the term ""data science"" presents a historic opportunity to redefine data analysis in a way that naturally incorporates causal inference from observational data. Like others before, we categorize the scientific contributions of data science into three classes of tasks  description, prediction, and counterfactual prediction, which includes causal inference. A clear classification of data science tasks is essential to discuss the data, assumptions, and analytics required to successfully accomplish each task. We contend that a failure to adequately describe the role of subject-matter expert knowledge in data analysis is a pervasive source of widespread misunderstandings about data science."
217,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"The weak gravity conjecture (WGC) demands the existence of super-extremal particles in any consistent quantum theory of gravity. This conjecture is crucial to ensure that extremal black holes are either unstable or marginally stable, but it remains unclear what would happen if this does not occur. This note highlights that, in a generic Einsteinian quantum theory of gravity in AdS, the stability of extremal black branes is in tension with rigorously proven quantum information theorems about entanglement entropy. To avoid this contradiction, a non-perturbative version of the WGC emerges, which reduces to the usual statement at weak coupling. The argument is general and does not rely on either supersymmetry or a particular UV completion, assuming only the validity of Einstein's gravity, effective field theory, and holography."
218,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"Understanding the profound correlations between two-dimensional (2D) systems is a major open problem in condensed matter physics, particularly in the quest to uncover the underlying mechanisms of unconventional superconductivity with high critical temperatures. Ultracold 2D Fermi gases have emerged as clean and controllable model systems to study the intricate interplay between strong correlations and reduced dimensionality. Despite their promise, direct evidence of superfluidity in these systems has remained elusive. In this work, we provide direct evidence of superfluidity in an ultracold 2D Fermi gas by dynamically introducing a periodic potential into the system and monitoring the absence of dissipation below a critical velocity, v_c. Our measurement of v_c as a function of interaction strength reveals a maximum in the crossover regime between bosonic and fermionic superfluidity. This finding establishes ultracold Fermi gases as a powerful tool for investigating the profound impact of reduced dimensionality on the behavior of strongly correlated superfluids."
219,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"The ordinary differential equation (ODE) is a mathematical model widely used in various application domains such as climatology, bioinformatics, and chemical engineering, owing to its intuitive appeal in modeling. Despite the widespread use of ODEs in modeling, the frequent absence of their analytical solutions poses a significant challenge in estimating ODE parameters from the data, particularly when the model involves numerous variables and parameters. This paper presents a Bayesian ODE parameter estimation algorithm that is both fast and accurate even for models with many parameters. The proposed method approximates an ODE model with a state-space model based on equations of a numerical solver. It enables fast estimation by avoiding the computation of a complete numerical solution in the likelihood. The posterior is obtained via a variational Bayes method, specifically, the approximate Riemannian conjugate gradient method (Höhnkel et al.)."
220,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"We investigate the transport properties and superconducting proximity effect in junctions formed by a time-reversal symmetry-breaking Weyl semimetal (WSM) in proximity to an s-wave superconductor. Our findings reveal that the differential conductance and induced pairing amplitudes strongly depend on the angle between the junction direction in real space and the axis separating the Weyl nodes in momentum space. Notably, we discover that a chiral chemical potential, i.e., the electron population imbalance between Weyl nodes of opposite chirality, significantly influences the transport characteristics of the junction. Interestingly, we observe a net spin polarization of Cooper pairs generated via Andreev reflection in the two WSM regions. The spin polarization exhibits an opposite sign in the two WSM regions and is highly sensitive to the chirality imbalance and excitation energy."
221,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"Metal ion implantation into ceramics has been demonstrated as an effective and controllable method for tailoring the surface electrical conductivity of ceramic pieces, with significant implications for a wide range of applications. Notably, this approach enables the grading of the voltage drop across high-voltage insulators, thereby increasing the maximum operational voltage that can be applied across the insulator without surface flashover. However, a key concern for the use of this method is the long-term stability of the implantation-induced conductivity, particularly when the implanted metal species is prone to oxidation. In this study, we report on our comprehensive examination of the long-term behavior of the surface conductivity of titanium-implanted alumina. Our findings indicate that, following an initial drop of up to 40% in the first few weeks post-implantation, the conductivity exhibits a remarkably slow decrease of approximately 10% over the subsequent year, demonstrating a promising stability and potential for long-term reliability in various industrial applications."
222,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"We introduce a groundbreaking concept for a novel Skyrme-like conserved current within the framework of the effective theory of pions and vector mesons, rooted in the paradigm of hidden local symmetry. The associated charge is analogous to the skyrmion charge for any smooth configuration. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of singular configurations that can be identified as n_f=1 baryons charged under the novel symmetry. Under this identification, the vector mesons assume the role of Chern-Simons vector fields residing on the quantum Hall droplet that constitutes the n_f=1 baryon. We propose that this current represents the correct effective expression for the baryon current at low energies. This proposal yields a unified framework for the two types of baryons, enabling a natural, continuous transformation between them. Moreover, Chern-Simons dualities on the droplet can be interpreted as a consequence of Seiberg-like duality between gluons and vector mesons."
223,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"Interfacial spin-orbit coupling in Josephson junctions presents a fascinating opportunity to merge anomalous Hall and Josephson physics within a single device. We theoretically investigate how the superposition of both effects influences the transport properties of superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator/superconductor junctions. The transverse momentum-dependent skew tunneling of Cooper pairs through the spin-active ferromagnetic insulator interface generates significant transverse Hall supercurrents, which we refer to as anomalous Josephson Hall effect currents. We extend the Furusaki-Tsukada formula, initially established to quantify traditional (tunneling) Josephson current flows, to evaluate the transverse current components and demonstrate that their amplitudes can be widely adjusted through the spin-orbit coupling strengths or the superconducting phase difference across the junction. Moreover, the well-localized subgap bound states that form around the interface serve as a clear spectroscopic fingerprint of Josephson junctions."
224,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"In a recent study published by Jimenez et al. in 2020, following the Monte Carlo experiments, it was found that dipoles play a crucial role in the dynamics of decaying two-dimensional turbulence. The kinetic energy of this flow is primarily carried by elongated streams formed by the concatenation of dipoles. These streams separate into two distinct families  small, fast-moving cores and larger, slowly moving ones that can be thought of as 'frozen' into a slowly evolving 'crystal'. The kinematics of these two families exhibit distinct characteristics, with the former being self-similar, while the latter is responsible for the majority of the kinetic energy in the flow. The vortices formed by the latter are the dipoles and the streams, and mechanisms are proposed for the growth of this slow-moving component."

The running time of quantum algorithms within this framework is typically characterized by the quantum hitting time  the time required for the quantum walk to find a vertex of interest with a high probability. In this article, we present improved upper bounds for the quantum hitting time that can be applied to several continuous-time quantum walk-based quantum algorithms. Specifically, we apply our techniques to the glued-trees problem, significantly improving their hitting time upper bound from O(n^5) to O(n^2 log n). Moreover, our methods also enable exponential improvements in the precision of the continuous-time quantum walk-based algorithm to locate a marked node on any ergodic, reversible Markov chain, as demonstrated by Chakraborty et al."

Dry (or the 'loss-cone') EMRIs, previously considered as the primary EMRI sources for the laser interferometer space antenna, are primarily produced by multi-body scattering in the nuclear star cluster and gravitational capture. In this letter, we highlight an alternative EMRI formation channel  wet EMRI formation assisted by the accretion flow around accreting galactic-center massive black holes (MBHs). In this channel, the accretion disk captures stellar-mass black holes that are initially moving on inclined orbits, and subsequently drives them to migrate towards the MBH, boosting the formation rate of EMRIs in such galaxies by orders of magnitude."

Under such circumstances, it is crucial for our recommender systems to effectively attract the users at the first interaction, so that the users decide to stay on the website and become active users. This problem falls under the category of new user cold-start, and it is crucial to the development and survival of a company. Existing works on user cold-start recommendation either require additional user efforts, such as setting up an interview process, or making use of side information, such as user demographics, locations, social relations, etc. However, users may not be willing to provide the interview and side information on cold-start users is usually not available, which can hinder the effectiveness of these methods."
228,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"Deep learning has successfully addressed numerous problems that were previously out of reach for heuristic algorithms. It has also been successfully applied in wireless communications, even in cases where the current radio systems are well-established and optimal algorithms exist for many tasks. While some gains have been achieved by learning individual components of a receiver, a more effective approach is to jointly learn the entire receiver. However, this often results in a challenging non-linear problem, for which the optimal solution is infeasible to implement. To address this, we propose a deep fully convolutional neural network, deeprx, which processes the entire receiver pipeline from frequency domain signal stream to uncoded bits in a 5G-compliant manner. We facilitate accurate channel estimation by constructing the input of the convolutional neural network in a very specific manner using both the data and pilot symbols, thereby ensuring optimal performance and reliability in wireless communications."
229,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"Mutation-based fuzzing typically employs an initial set of non-crashing seed inputs, a corpus, from which to generate novel inputs through mutation. To ensure efficient fuzzing, it is crucial to select a diverse set of seeds that effectively cover the same range of instrumentation data points as the comprehensive corpus. The lack of diversity in seed inputs can lead to wasted fuzzing effort, as exhaustive mutation from all available seeds can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. To address this, fuzzers often come equipped with distillation tools, such as afl-cmin, that enable the selection of the smallest subset of seeds that triggers the same range of instrumentation data points as the full corpus. Our research suggests that minimizing the number and cumulative size of the seeds leads to more efficient fuzzing, which we systematically investigate. We present the results of 34 CPU-years of fuzzing with five distillation approaches to understand their impact in identifying bugs in real-world software."

The agents can be categorized into several groups, each comprising agents with isomorphic state transition structures, which can be relabeled to the same template. To design a scalable supervisor whose state size and computational cost are independent of the number of agents, we propose a supervisor that does not require recalculation regardless of how many agents are added to or removed from the system. We generalize our earlier results to partial observation by deriving sufficient conditions for safety and maximal permissiveness of the scalable least restrictive supervisor on the template level. An illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the proposed scalable supervisory synthesis."

The approach utilizes a novel temporal windowing strategy based on the filter-bank Capon spectral estimator, which exploits the Toeplitz structure of the covariance matrix. The Goergen-Semencul factorization of the model covariance matrix is employed, providing a more efficient computation of the matrix inverse. Furthermore, this method innovatively employs Krylov matrices for fast implementation of matrix inversions. Notably, this approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in electric network frequency estimation when utilizing a short time window of 1 second in power recordings. In speech recordings, the proposed method achieves highly accurate results in terms of both time complexity and accuracy."

As a corollary, regularized regression estimators based on these reduced dimension spaces are also provided, ranging from classical principal component regression to sparse partial robust M-regression. The package also includes a suite of classical and robust pre-processing utilities, including generalized spatial signs, as well as dedicated plotting functionality and cross-validation utilities.

233,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"The nonlinear fluorescence emission has been extensively applied for high-resolution optical imaging, particularly in the spatial resolution domain. In this study, we investigated the fluorescence anomalous saturation effect of nitrogen vacancy defects in diamond. The fluorescence reduction was observed under high-power laser excitation, which increased the nonlinearity of the fluorescence emission and altered the spatial frequency distribution of the fluorescence image. We employed a differential excitation protocol to extract high-spatial-frequency information. By modulating the excitation laser's power, the spatial resolution of imaging was enhanced, approximately 1.6 times higher than that of confocal microscopy, due to the simplicity of the experimental setup and data processing. This method is expected to be applicable for improving the spatial resolution of sensing and biological labeling with defects in solids."
234,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"When we correlate random effects with sample design variables, the traditional approach of using individual survey weights, constructed to be inversely proportional to the unit survey inclusion probabilities, no longer yields asymptotically unbiased inference when employed. We develop a weight-exponentiated formulation for the random effects distribution that achieves unbiased inference for generating hyperparameters of the random effects. Our approach contrasts with frequentist methods that rely on numerical integration, revealing that only the Bayesian method attains both unbiased estimation with respect to the sampling design distribution and consistency with respect to the population generating distribution. Our simulations and real-data examples, including a survey of business establishments, demonstrate the versatility of our approach across various modeling formulations and sampling designs. This work serves as a culmination of recent developments that combine traditional survey estimation approaches with the Bayesian modeling paradigm, providing a bridge between the two distinct but complementary subfields."

The reduced symmetries of these emerging materials give rise to a plethora of inhomogeneous phenomena, including electron, optical, valley, and spin responses, as well as entirely novel properties such as ferroelasticity, ferroelectricity, magnetism, spin-wave phenomena, large nonlinear optical properties, photogalvanic effects, and superconductivity. Furthermore, novel electronic topological properties, nonlinear elastic properties, and structural phase transformations can occur due to the low symmetry.

For the first time, it was found that in a mesogenic polymer, in contrast to low-molecular-weight mesogens, the relaxation of the electric birefringence of a melt above the temperature of the nematic-isotropic phase transition can be described by a sum of several exponential processes, two of which play a decisive role. These primary processes exhibit a reciprocal relationship, replacing each other in a temperature range of approximately fifty degrees Celsius. Dielectric spectroscopy also enabled the distinction of two processes of orientational relaxation  the first is attributed to the rotation of the side mesogenic groups, and the second is associated with the motion of the main chain segments."
237,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"In deep hashing methods, the primary focus is on optimizing discrete hash bits for large-scale image retrieval. A common strategy employed in these methods is to adopt an activation function, such as the sigmoid or tanh function, and minimize a quantization loss to approximate discrete values. However, this paradigm may lead to a phenomenon where more and more hash bits become stuck in the saturated region of the activation functions and fail to escape. We refer to this issue as the 'dead bits problem.' Furthermore, the existing quantization loss exacerbates the 'dead bits problem.' In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective gradient amplifier that operates before activation functions to mitigate the 'dead bits problem'."

We consider both the possibility that the triplets are stable and contribute to the dark matter density, or that they decay via mixing with the standard model Higgs boson. The former is constrained by the absence of charged track searches at the LHC and by dark matter direct detection experiments, while the latter is constrained by existing multi-lepton collider searches. Our findings indicate that a two-step electroweak phase transition involving a stable triplet with a negative quadratic term is ruled out by direct detection searches, whereas an unstable triplet with a mass less than 230 GeV is excluded at 95% confidence level."
239,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,paper_abstract,"This paper demonstrates that the eccentric debris rings surrounding the stars Fomalhaut and HD 202628 are narrower than expected in the standard eccentric planet perturbation scenario, often referred to as the ""pericenter glow"" phenomenon. The standard scenario postulates an initially circular and narrow belt of planetesimals at semi-major axis a, whose eccentricity is increased to ef after the gas disc has dispersed by secular perturbations from an eccentric planet, resulting in a belt of width 2ae_f. In a minor modification of this scenario, narrower belts can arise if the planetesimals are initially eccentric, which could result from earlier planet perturbations during the gas-rich protoplanetary disc phase. Alternatively, a primordial eccentricity could be caused by instabilities that increase the disc eccentricity, without the need for any planets. This alternative scenario highlights the potential for the formation of narrow debris rings in the early stages of planetary system formation."

However, it is theoretically possible that it could have more, considering its spin and charge, or by exciting other electrons. In one dimension (1D), the physics of interacting electrons is well captured by the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) model at low energies. However, little has been experimentally observed beyond this linear regime. In this work, we report on measurements of many-body modes in 1D gated-wires using a tunnelling spectroscopy technique. Our results reveal two distinct Fermi seas at high energies, associated with spin and charge excitations, as well as the emergence of three additional 1D'replica' modes that strengthen with decreasing wire length. The effective interaction strength in the wires is modulated by varying the amount of 1D inter-subband screening by more than 45%."

It is likely that the globular cluster system of our galaxy has followed a similarly intricate formation path. To constrain this formation path, we explore the link between the globular clusters and the known merging events that the Milky Way has experienced. To this end, we combined the kinematic information provided by Gaia for almost all galactic clusters, with the largest sample of cluster ages available after carefully correcting for systematic errors. To identify clusters with a common origin, we analyzed their dynamical properties, particularly in the space of integrals of motion.

This few-get-richer effect arises in settings where there are only a few distinct classes of items (e.g., left-leaning news sources versus right-leaning news sources), and items are ranked based on their popularity. Our analysis demonstrates that this phenomenon emerges when individuals tend to click on top-ranked items and have diverse preferences for the classes of items. Using simulations, we examine how the strength of the effect changes under different assumptions about the setting and human behavior.

To address this issue, we introduce a novel sparsity dimension, namely pattern-based sparsity, which encompasses pattern and connectivity sparsity, and achieves both high accuracy and hardware friendliness. By designing carefully crafted patterns, our proposed pruning approach consistently and unprecedentedly enhances accuracy and improves feature extraction capabilities on various DNN structures and datasets, and our pattern-aware pruning framework also facilitates pattern library extraction, pattern selection, pattern, and connectivity pruning, as well as weight training, simultaneously. Our approach, grounded in the new pattern-based sparsity, naturally fits seamlessly into compiler optimization for highly efficient DNN execution on mobile platforms."

To mitigate this bias, constructing a more closely matched control group by selecting a subset of the overall control group that closely mirrors the treated group can result in a more accurate comparison. We investigate this phenomenon in simulation studies. In our study, we examine the impact of mountaintop removal mining (MRM) on mortality using a difference-in-differences analysis that leverages the increase in MRM following the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments. For a difference-in-differences analysis of the effect of MRM on mortality, we constructed a more closely matched control group and found a 95% confidence interval that encompasses substantial adverse effects, as well as small beneficial effects."

Growing up in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, the birthplace of Bethlehem Steel, I had a unique upbringing. My father, an engineer, would teach me about the inner workings of things. We would collaborate on projects, such as model rockets and slot cars. Here's a photo of the go-kart we built together. That's me behind the wheel, accompanied by my sister and my best friend at the time. And one day, when I was around 10 years old, he came home, and at the dinner table, he announced that for our next project, we were going to build a robot, a robot, a machine that would learn and adapt to its environment, a true marvel of engineering and innovation."

I desire to know the individuals behind my dinner choices. I desire to know how I impact them. I desire to know how they impact me. I desire to know why they thrive. I desire to know how they rely on the ocean's bounty for their survival. Understanding all of this enables us to shift our perspective of seafood away from a resource to an opportunity to restore our ecosystem. It allows for us to celebrate the seafood that we're fortunate to consume. I believe we can call this concept restorative seafood. Where sustainability is the capacity to endure and maintain, restorative is the ability to replenish and progress."

The spinster, lost in her tattered wedding dress, is a haunting figure from the works of Charles Dickens. The stone-hearted miser, haunted by the ghost of Christmas past, is another recognizable character from the author's body of work. More than a century after his death, these characters remain iconic figures from the work of Charles Dickens. So striking is his body of work that it has given rise to its own adjective - ""Dickensian"". But what are the features of Dickens's writing that make it so captivating? Dickens's fiction abounds with anticipation through brooding settings, plot twists, and mysteries. These features of his work kept his audience enthralled. When first published, his stories were serialized, meaning they were released a few chapters at a time in affordable literary journals and only later reprinted as books."

Before diving deeper into the details of this technology, let's first take a brief look at the current state of human characters in computer games. This is a clip from the game 'Grand Theft Auto 3,' which we briefly showcased yesterday. As you can see, it's a highly acclaimed game, and one of the most successful of all time."

The prospect of proving your innocence seems insurmountable, and the consequences of being found guilty are dire – execution hangs precariously in the balance. However, if you opt to confess, express remorse, and implicate others, you may be granted clemency. This was the agonizing dilemma faced by those accused of witchcraft in Salem, Massachusetts, between February 1692 and May 1693. These victims of mass hysteria, fueled by superstition and misdirected fervor, were subjected to a justice system that prioritized contrition over truth. The village of Salem, founded by Puritan settlers in 1626, was marked by strict and isolated living conditions. Ongoing conflicts with Native American tribes and French colonists only added to the sense of unease that pervaded the community."

Unfortunately, the number of available donor organs is woefully insufficient to meet the staggering demand. What if, instead of waiting for a match, we could create brand-new, custom-designed organs from scratch? That is the innovative concept behind bioprinting, a cutting-edge branch of regenerative medicine currently under development. While we are not yet able to print complex organs, we are making significant strides in creating simpler tissues, such as blood vessels and tubes responsible for facilitating nutrient exchange and waste elimination, which are crucial for the survival of the human body. Bioprinting is a biological cousin of 3D printing, a technique that deposits layers of material on top of each other to construct a three-dimensional object one layer at a time."

I'd like to share with you a phenomenon that's not only fascinating, but also has the power to transform the world - and its name is people power. I'll begin with a thought-provoking anecdote, reminiscent of a Monty Python-esque sketch. It's December 15, 2010. Someone offers you a bet  you're given a crystal ball, and you're promised that the future you see will be accurate; the only condition is that you must share it with the world. Your curiosity gets the better of you, and you take the bet. One hour later, you find yourself on the set of a national television show, recounting the story to a captivated audience."

However, a small but vocal minority raises a dissenting voice, accusing Dylan of plagiarizing the work of others. Fast-forward to 2004, Brian Burton, aka Danger Mouse, takes the Beatles' iconic ""White Album"" and Jay-Z's ""The Black Album"" and skillfully fuses them to create ""The Grey Album."" This innovative mashup, dubbed ""The Grey Album,"" sparks an immediate online sensation, prompting the Beatles' record label to send out a barrage of cease-and-desist letters, citing ""unfair competition and dilution of our valuable intellectual property."" The label insists that ""The Grey Album"" is, in fact, a remix."
265,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,speech,"While it may seem an obvious statement, I began pondering this issue about 12 years ago, initially in the context of developing countries. However, considering the global scope, I believe it's essential to recognize that every country on the planet has areas where good teachers are sorely needed. If you envision a world map, I think you'll agree that for each country, you could draw circles around regions where the need for quality education is most pressing. Moreover, these are often the very areas from which the greatest challenges arise. We have an intriguing paradox - good educators are often reluctant to venture to places where they are needed most urgently. In 1999, I embarked on an experiment to address this conundrum, starting with a simple initiative in New Delhi."

We account for over 60% of the global refugee population. As the majority of refugees settle in urban areas, there is a pressing need for a paradigm shift and innovative thinking. Rather than expending resources on constructing physical barriers, it would be more effective to allocate funds towards programs that empower refugees to become self-sufficient and contribute to the development of their host countries. (Applause) While we are forced to leave behind our material possessions, we must not abandon our skills and knowledge. If provided the opportunity to lead a productive life, refugees can not only help themselves but also contribute to the growth and prosperity of their host nations.

These queries are the opening prompts I use in my poetry workshops, as they often spark insightful discussions about the significance of one's identity and purpose. When I ask these questions, I share my own responses, which are as follows  I am the daughter of black writers, who are the descendants of freedom fighters who broke their shackles and revolutionized the world. These words are a personal mantra I repeat before each poetry performance, and I find solace in their power.

(laughs) Hello. I once painted myself white one day, stood on a box, placed a hat or a can at my feet, and when someone came by and dropped in money, I handed them a flower – and some intense eye contact.

This diminutive, roughly two-foot-diameter metal sphere sparked a protracted space race between the United States and the Soviet Union, a competition that would persist for nearly two decades and forever alter the trajectory of human history. Interestingly, Sputnik was not the first human-made object to venture into space. That distinction belongs to the V-2 rocket, developed by Germany during World War II as a desperate last resort to target Allied cities. Although the V-2 proved ineffective, both the United States and the Soviet Union seized the technology and the scientists behind it, incorporating their expertise into their own projects, setting the stage for a new era in space exploration."

In addition to music, my iPod also contains a variety of concertos and symphonies that I enjoy listening to during my daily commute. As an avid reader, I devour books from authors such as Ian McEwan and Stephanie Meyer, having read the entire Twilight tetralogy. When I'm not indulging in literature, I'm often found in my home theater, where I relish devouring DVDs, video-on-demand content, and a wide range of television shows.

Drawing from my personal experience and that of the women around me, I can attest that it's a grueling ordeal. It's exhausting to carefully extract a discreet pad from a brown paper bag, hastily stash it in one's pocket during a class, and rush to the washroom with an air of furtiveness. It's draining to sit through lessons and meetings, pretending to be utterly composed, while internally struggling to cope with the intense physical discomfort of period cramps."

Among them, one brother, Deminan, stood apart from the others, his body scarred by painful scabs that seemed to hold the secrets of his mysterious past. One day, while the supreme spirit, Yaya, was absent from his gardens, Deminan and his brothers slipped into Yaya's abode, their curiosity getting the better of them.

Essentially, Theranos aimed to revolutionize the medical device industry by creating a device that would enable individuals to run their entire blood panel tests on a finger-stick of blood, eliminating the need for a painful needle prick in the arm. This innovation was exciting not only because it promised to reduce patient discomfort, but also because it had the potential to open the door to more accurate and predictive diagnostic capabilities."

In this community, we didn't have the luxury of modern conveniences like television, computers, or radio. Instead, our days were filled with outdoor activities with the Inuit, playing in the snow and ice. The Arctic landscape became my playground, and the Inuit became my mentors. It was during this time that I became deeply fascinated with this polar realm, and my passion for it only grew stronger with each passing day."

We don't discriminate by gender, race, or any other factor; we accept anyone who has been failed by the system. We understand that our role is not only to contain and control those who come to us, but also to provide a second chance, a chance to rehabilitate and reintegrate into society. Over the years, we have honed our skills and expertise in this area, but our incarceration rates per capita remain higher than those of any other country in the world. It is a sobering reality that we have more black men in prison today than there were under slavery in 1850.

As a self-proclaimed outdoorsman, Roosevelt was drawn to the natural beauty of Yosemite, but Muir had invited him to the valley for a more pressing reason  the area was under threat. Although Yosemite had been protected since 1864, the valley remained vulnerable to overdevelopment in 1903. At the heart of a decades-long struggle to balance preservation and public use, the battle for Yosemite had its roots in the 1849 gold rush, when the discovery of gold in the Sierra Nevada foothills triggered a mass migration of miners westward."

As a novice journalist, I recognized the gravity of the situation and the need for a more impactful approach, as everyone was aware of the widespread corruption, yet nothing was being done to address it. I decided to adopt a different strategy, immersing myself in the situation by posing as a vendor myself. Through this undercover reporting, I was able to gather concrete evidence, which had a profound impact.

Headlines like these are published daily, often presenting opposite claims from one another. There can be a disconnect between the attention-grabbing headlines and the specific, incremental results of the medical research they cover. To avoid being misled by sensationalized headlines, it's essential to assess a headline's credibility by examining the original research it reports on.

288,hybrid,none,none,polish_slight_major,speech,"The origin of the carbon dioxide we release is a natural cycle, present in all living organisms  in the soil, oceans, atmosphere, and rocks deep beneath the Earth's surface. When plants and other living organisms die, a significant portion of their stored carbon is gradually released back into the atmosphere, where it is reabsorbed by new plant growth. However, over millions of years, some of the carbon stored in ancient trees and sea life becomes trapped in rock formations, and some is transformed into fossil fuels  coal, oil, and natural gas. Natural geological events, such as volcanic eruptions, release some of the carbon that has been trapped in the Earth's crust. Moreover, human activities, like the burning of fossil fuels, also release a substantial amount of prehistoric carbon dioxide. In fact, humans release approximately 60 times more carbon dioxide annually than all the volcanoes on the planet combined."

One of the most striking distinctions between natural and human technologies lies in their robustness. Robust systems exhibit remarkable stability in complex and uncharted environments, a trait that is particularly evident in the remarkable ability of cockroaches to self-stabilize while traversing rugged terrain. When equipped with a jet pack or subjected to perturbations such as earthquakes, we observed that their exquisitely tuned legs enable them to self-stabilize without relying on any cerebral processing. Notably, they can navigate intricate terrain like grass with ease, without experiencing destabilization. Our research has uncovered a novel behavior, wherein their unique shape allows them to automatically roll onto their side to traverse artificial grass obstacles. The significance of robust systems lies in their capacity to perform multiple tasks with a single structural framework. Our investigation has yielded a fascinating new behavior, highlighting the remarkable adaptability of these creatures."

Sperm donors are often referred to as ""biological fathers,"" but should we really be using the word ""father"" as a label? As a philosopher and social scientist, I have been studying these questions about the concept of parenthood. However, today, I will share with you what I learned from talking to parents and children.

However, it wasn't the punishment I faced as a teenager in adult prison or the harsh realities of our legal system that ultimately propelled me forward. Instead, it was an extraordinary learning environment in a classroom that opened my eyes to the possibility of redemption and transformation, something I never thought was feasible for me or our justice system as a whole. A few weeks before my release on parole, a counselor encouraged me to enroll in a new college course being offered within the prison walls, and that decision marked the beginning of a transformative journey that would forever alter the trajectory of my life."

Or maybe you're just someone who's simply going through a frustrating airport security check. I understand that some of your perceptions may be influenced by the media's portrayal of people who share your appearance. A study revealed that a staggering 80% of news coverage about Islam and Muslims is negative. Moreover, research shows that many Americans don't know a Muslim personally. Perhaps it's because people don't often engage in conversations with their Uber drivers, who may hold vastly different perspectives.

At the time, I was setting the stage for the questions I would be asked for the next decade. Like many of my peers in their early twenties, I was eager to solve the world's problems, particularly the pressing issue of water scarcity. I had a lot to learn. It was an alluring notion, believing that our most pressing water quality challenges persist because they're inherently difficult to detect.

These air vibrations are traveling to you, striking your eardrums, and then your brain converts those vibrations into thoughts. I hope that this process is indeed occurring. Due to this remarkable ability, humans are capable of transmitting our ideas across vast expanses of space and time, allowing us to share knowledge across minds."

The notion is not lost on me that there was a recent report suggesting that scientists considered replacing rats in their experiments with politicians. When asked why, the response was telling  ""Why not? There's no shortage of politicians, no one really cares about their well-being, and, let's be frank, there are certain things that rats simply won't do."" (laughter) As someone who thrives on data, I'm delighted to begin with a data-rich slide."
