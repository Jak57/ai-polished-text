1,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"Another week flew by me. I drove by the new house yesterday and the front window was covered in boxes. We may get the keys at closing, I am getting so excited. If all goes well this week, we will be set for closing a week from Wednesday. I was up until after 3:00 am last night watching movies with Bethany. There has been a lot of movie watching going on around here lately. Here's my rundown; last night we watched thirteen, a movie every mother of a teen should see. It was better than I expected. Then we watched Gigli, yeah it was just as bad as the media said it was, but we had to see for ourselves."
2,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"Summer TV used to be a dead zone, filled with repeats or reruns. However, there are now two exceptional new shows on TV, and I've been watching both devotedly for the past week. A peculiar concept has caught my attention: hairstylist Jonathan Antin wants to open a second location of his highly popular West Hollywood salon in Beverly Hills. Initially, I wouldn't have cared, but while flipping channels, I stumbled upon Jonathan, equally self-absorbed and unremarkable, gazing at an empty space on Rodeo Drive, proclaiming (in a public voice) ""I am going to build here the greatest salon in the history of the world!"" I was hooked. Not since Rocco have I found a character so captivating on TV."
3,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"What a week ago, my right shoulder had tendonitis. It's located under my shoulder blade. So, when I move my arm too much, mainly with a mouse on a computer, it kills me. I can barely get up the strength to draw anything. Lack of sleep adds to my pain. I'm not too happy right now, but I'll get better. My mom's surgery went okay. Her eyesight has come back some. She can see fuzzy shapes and make out colors. Other than that, she's still blind as all sight. Hopefully, she'll fully regain her vision soon."
4,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"Kindness of strangers... Attempted laundry with the kids in tow, I realized how quickly the simplest things can become a daunting ordeal. I also learned how remarkably sweet total strangers can be, simply because they feel like being kind. Trust me. It wasn't as if they were trying to get into my pants or anything. I had kid-drool all over me and was wearing my 'wash-day' outfit... Also, I'm not sure I'll ever be bathing again, so it's not like there was even an olfactory incentive there! I am doing two things right now. I am composing an post and I am also watching the collected no doubt videos. I am doing both of these things sitting at my desk in my room."
5,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"So it's 11:14 pm MST, and here I sit in my bedroom fixing the personal computer of the personnel director from my job. Not that I mind doing it, but I wonder sometimes at how often I find myself fixing someone else's computer as a favor. I'm glad to be able to love and minister to people this way, but where is the line drawn where it comes to the point that you are being taken advantage of? The last couple of weeks, I've been staying up late reading and such, so I was looking forward to hitting the sack early, until I realized it would be more prudent to get this computer out of my bedroom and back into its owner's hands. *laughs* No rest for the weary, right? So I found myself watching Joe Schmo 2 again tonight."
6,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"Remind me, what did I write about before this? Or, a continuation in the 'is this a date?' saga, so after the weird lunch, my confidence shook, I forgot to tell you guys an important piece of the story. Before Pat shows up to lunch, Dustin starts talking about what a nice guy Pat is and how he's trying to find a girlfriend for him. I'm listening and nodding, realizing that we're talking more about finding Dustin's best friend a girl than discussing whatever it is you discuss with a stranger over pink lemonade. I excused myself to the bathroom, looked in the mirror, and then silently asked myself  Am I being pawned off to the other guy? Is this what happens now?"
7,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"I would like everyone to think before they act. Actually, I'd like each and every person in the world to think before they get out of bed in the morning, and make a commitment to keep thinking all day. If they're not prepared to, I'd like them to take a moment to reflect and adjust their actions. I'm tired of people who act impulsively. I'm not the smartest person in the world, but I'm not talking about complex concepts. I think it's fair to call out the thoughtless actions of some individuals. Let's focus on specific behaviors today, and save other topics for another day, sound good?"
8,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"Two problems with the scenario outlined in my previous post  1. True, bush is stimulating the economy, but in the wrong way. Robert Rubin told NPR's Marketplace today that Bush could have achieved the same stimulus effect without the long-term debt hangover by enacting different tax cuts, temporary tax cuts that would benefit low and middle-income persons. Ah, Robert Rubin. The sound of his name is music to our ears. Quick  name one Bush administration cabinet official with Rubin's gravitas. Still thinking? It'll come to you... 2. We cannot give the Republicans control only in wartime because they've ingeniously concocted an endless, global 'war on terror'."
10,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"Do you ever have those moments when you begin to reflect on life? Like you're sitting in math class, bored out of your skull, and you wonder what exactly goes on in your brain that makes you understand math? And you realize that you exist, and you're in math class, and you wonder why. Then you realize how amazing existing is. And suddenly it hits you - the fact that you're going off on this random train of thought is incredibly pathetic. Ever had that happen? I hate that. You know what else I hate? Block schedules. Who would ever come up with that idea? Anyone can see that sitting through a two and a half hour class in any subject is cruel and unusual punishment."

Tonight, Andy beat me by a few small dollars and won the Farqu game, or maybe I let him win on account of him leaving in a few short hours and me wanting him to feel good on his last night here. Well, how the story goes, it can't compare to this Texas-sized headache I have at the moment, I've taken some Aleve and I must say that they are doing the trick; all I need now is some well-deserved R&R."
12,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"Well, today has been a long day. We drove home from Indiana. I guess I'll have to be choosy about what I write about because I could take up a lot of time and space, and I just don't have enough energy. First, I have to say that camp was awesome, even better than I could have expected. God has been doing so much in my life lately, and it's just awesome. I've sort of turned over a new leaf, but anyway, back to the beginning. We arrived at the Twiggs' house on Friday evening and stayed until we left for camp on Monday. Most of what we did was visit the fair, attend church, watch a parade, shop at Walmart, and watch movies."

I dislike that, but I'd rather get it over with than try to schedule it during the first month of my surgery rotation. I'm definitely nervous, scared, and anxious about the prospect. This is going to be a whole new challenge for me. As a perfectionist, I love excelling at everything I do. But starting new things is challenging. I dislike being a pawn and I dislike not knowing what's going on."
14,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"Arun Shourie discusses how the current governor of Uttar Pradesh, as far back as 1996, warned about the looming threat of a ""third Islamic State"" emerging in the subcontinent. T. V. Rajeswar, the former head of the Intelligence Bureau and current governor of Uttar Pradesh, had predicted this dire threat in a series of articles published in the Hindustan Times in 1996. Shourie raises a pertinent point when he asks, does the fact that you now know that Rajeswar, not I, and certainly not Mr. Advani, authored these warnings make them more credible? Or do you conclude that because Rajeswar wrote repeatedly about this threat, he is a closet communalist and unfit to continue as governor of Uttar Pradesh?"
15,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"Attitude  indifferent, looking forward to tonight after a long, hard day in the trenches here, folks, I've had little time to write anything for you readers. However, it's good to see Tigger taking up the reins herself and making an appearance, talking about things. Not much to say about things, yesterday was a lovely play, but I had to leave before the curtain closed, which was a bit disappointing. But I digress. Acron is right about the problems with the shower, it's indeed a bit frustrating, in terms of laughing at her in the shower, you have to admit, the look people get when committing self-torture can be quite amusing."
16,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"All of a sudden, for the past two days, I have been overcome with terrible bouts of exhaustion. Bone-deep exhaustion. Last evening, I went home, and just slept off, and only got up when my mother called me around 8 30. And when I woke up, it was all dark, and I hadn't switched the lights on, so I couldn't figure out what time or date it was, for a few seconds, it was just my mother's voice in the darkness and me grappling with reality. Wonder why I'm feeling so drained... Nice weather this morning. It was drizzling when I came. Although in Kolkata, I hear it's been raining for the past three days."
17,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"Last night was the worst. I discarded the sweater I was knitting. I only had about 14 inches. I lost probably $10 worth of yarn (it's $8 a skein). But it had too many stitches by the time I got to the armholes and the mohair was knotting itself together as I knitted, so frogging (ripping out rows) didn't work well. The yarn broke a lot. I didn't even swear, which is unusual for me. I just morosely ripped and listened to season two of Sex and the City (way to go, library!). And then I got sick of it and discarded it. I suppose I could say I learned a lot while trying to do this sweater."
18,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"Last night in class, we discussed the week's assigned reading, ""Toward a Renewed Study of the Place-World"" by Edward S. Casey. The first chapter focuses on ""implacement"" and the second, ""displacement."" In the first chapter, Casey makes the distinction that our contemporary world and culture revolve around time as the situating force  we are running out of time, we have saved time, we are just in time. He attempts to argue that using place as the center of culture provides a more grounded community. So far, this book is the first reading that has captivated me by the proverbial shoulders."

And while giggling is good, one wonders if we would have found ourselves up that fire escape drinking beer in the fierce wind had we not been eating them earlier. Finding ourselves in a doorway to a bar sadly closed for business, we stopped to examine an office-supplies catalogue that had arrived in the post. Lucky we did. Who could possibly have guessed that within these pages were the special offers of a lifetime? Not I, for certain. I list but a few  buy 36 permanent marker pens, get a stunt kite."
20,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"Currently listening to  The Little Drummer Boy by Stevan Pasero...and now my post... Senate Republicans okay, hands up - who watched the 39-hour judicial nomination marathon last week? I know I didn't. Well, okay - I did tune in once or twice. The entire colossal waste of time was perpetrated by Republicans who, peeved off that Democrats wouldn't roll over and nominate four of Bush's unorthodox justices, were trying to score political points by holding a multi-day spectacle. Never mind the fact that the Democrats have already approved 168 of Bush's judicial nominees - no, that's not good enough for the power-hungry Republicans who are for some reason laboring under the misapprehension they have a huge mandate for this kind of nonsense."
21,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"This was an excellent weekend. I accomplished a lot of outdoor activities, after a long time, I indulged in a lot of reading, something I should have started doing much earlier. I finished three books over the weekend - Bruce Sterling's Heavy Weather, Larry Niven's World of Ptavvs, and Octavia Butler's Parable of the Sower. Heavy Weather was a thrilling cyberpunk adventure through a near-future USA, ravaged by global warming and general anarchy. While it was clever, well-paced, and altogether very convincing, I must confess that I failed to come away with any truly profound sensations about the story or the characters. Not that both aren't well-constructed and vividly etched - it's a good book, but not a remarkable one, I suppose."
22,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"Coz, this is the aftermath of the first week back from practicum, which was a struggle, but it is only in the second week that the smoke has really started to clear. Post-practicum trauma was a hidden epidemic that is only now coming to light. I was struck, but with the eventual meeting with the course co-ordinator, I was able to release my burden, and by doing so, I prevented another person from being stuck with such a pedagogically deficient practicum school. Yesterday, I bumped into another agrieved classmate who was quite determined to go to the student who was due to go to her school in the next practicum and tell him how terrible it will be. I calmed her down and suggested that we should go to the administrator first."
23,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"Well, things are incredibly busy here at times, but there's always time for stress-relieving activities. I've found that I really struggle with 8-ball and ping pong! Rick, the Canadian, beats me on a regular basis - we have a ping-pong table in the front lobby of our building, always time for a 'quick round'. Last night, I participated in an 8-ball tournament at the hot spot, our recreation tent, complete with a popcorn machine, numerous TVs, jukebox, DVD rental, pool table, dartboard, and ever-present ping-pong table. Anyway, I was doing pretty well throughout my one entire game - until I scratched on the eight ball. I still had a fairly good time; the most fun was the two Dutch soldiers who joined in the tournament."
24,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"Fall 1974  I was attempting, for what felt like the 13th time, to fight my way through the second chapter of my high school algebra book. I wasn't then, nor am I now, a math person. I hate math; I am math-phobic. You get the picture. So, as I struggled to make sense out of algebra, the doorbell rang. I put down my book and went to open the door. No one was there. Great. I returned to my studies and, just as I was finding a little glimmer of understanding buried in my subconscious, the doorbell rang again. Began, just like my breakthrough disappeared. I went to the door and, once again, no one was there. Just what a struggling math student needs, an uninvited, practical joker."
25,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"This past week has been nothing short of exhausting. I spent Tuesday-Thursday finishing the move to my new classroom. The new room is bigger and closer to my grade-level team, these are the things I need to consider as I spend hours upon hours preparing my room for this year. Had I known I was going to move prior to the end of my school year, I would have discarded much of the books and supplies I no longer use. Unfortunately, it all came with me. So this week was spent moving, unpacking, and purging profusely. I have to thank my teammate, Jill, for helping with all of this. You see, she was still teaching this month in my old room. So she and her lovely students moved almost my entire room for me!"

Forever will I always be reminded of the very few nights we spent together, hearts and limbs entwined in a soul-embrace, drenched in the salty darkness of an evening by the beach... Or a kiss under the rain. Whenever I get the feeling of a dark glass puncturing my heart, you will be there. That piece of you... And still remains."

Or let me rephrase that, the article I'm doing and its consequences isn't something I'm comfortable with. Perhaps it's because I don't believe in it enough, so I cannot really get the complete feel for it. The angst behind it. The full-out passion towards it to question. I've grown up in a country where you don't ask questions. Really, you just don't. They shoot you for that. They put you in jail with all these internal security acts. I'm not used to this freedom of speech - not used to questioning out loud. Sure, I'm not the easiest person to get along with."
28,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,blog,"We had an outing yesterday with my colleagues from the bank. We ventured to Guinubiran, La Carlota. It was the first time for most of us. We trekked to the falls. The 30-minute walk was moderately challenging. We were all catching our breath. Whew! But we made it. The water was icy cold. You can feel your body numbing due to the chill. We only stayed less than an hour because we headed for the nearby waterfalls. Another 30 minutes of trekking followed. However, the trip was worth it because the falls looked serene and the entire scene was breathtaking. It was as if you could hear yourself becoming one with nature. Soaking myself in the cold water was like communing with Mother Earth. The cold air and water lulled us into a state of deep relaxation."

So we have a month left before Ed leaves. I think it's starting to sink in with Ed and all of us. I think it sank in with me a long time ago. I just hope that Ed will be here for Bailey's surgery. We've been keeping an eye on his swelling, and there definitely is quite a bit of swelling."

Thank goodness I brought a bag of eggs with me, just in case. So Connor had a great time finding eggs out in the park. Sunday morning when he woke up, he was so excited the Easter bunny had come. There's nothing better than seeing the excitement on your child's face. After egg hunting, we all went to church. Even though the Easter bunny is fun and all, we do make sure our kids know the true meaning of the holidays. This was Megan's first Easter, she looked so cute in her jean dress and stockings."

However, I believe too much energy was spent on the set, and not enough on creating a solidifying tone, theme, etc. It retold the story, but it was not particularly gripping, and I don't feel like I gained anything from watching it. The character development was rather weak. Additionally, I thought the score was poor, and was basically a knock-off of the Gladiator. The Gladiator used the background music of a moaning woman and it worked because it backed up and complemented a genuinely gripping narrative."

Why a person who has 1.74m can't become as good in shooting as a person with 1.71m? I'm 1.87m in RL, made my first player with this height and noticed then I can't reach a higher skill than 89. Why? That's a pure discrimination! And why the game doesn't tell me that before I create a character and not even then when I reach the skill limit after weeks of playing?!"
101,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"I think this assassin's creed nailed the mechanics down on all fronts, including ship battles, sailing, hunting, parkour, etc. I felt much more attached to this character as well. The story starts out extremely rough but does get much better as you play, I think this is true for every AC game personally. Edward was quite the interesting character, and so were all the side characters. I felt like all the collectibles actually meant something in this AC game, which I never got from any of the previous ones, and maybe it's because I felt like they had a bigger purpose in the game. They were not required but were fun to get, and you got rewarded in a very balanced way."
102,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"While I personally cannot recommend this game, it wasn't absolutely terrible. The gunplay is alright, so long as you have the money to purchase gun parts, which would be my main complaint with this game: it's pay-to-win. If I could get past that, the game would be enjoyable, as the hard suit is fun to use and HRV is an excellent idea. I'd take this game over any Call of Duty title any day, but its pay-to-win microtransaction format is off-putting for me. If you are alright with this model, then by all means, have fun."
103,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"While not perfect, this game has been greatly enjoyable. The save system and possibility of sudden death leads to some frustration. I'm on my first playthrough, and I lost my main character around the 10-hour mark of 20 hours. I would have really liked a save to reload at that point. I've since picked up a third-party mod/save tool to avoid catastrophic failures. Plus, the aiming reticle is on the small side, and zoom is underpowered. With all that said, it's been a blast. I'm not normally a zombie fan, but the combination of strategy, missions, first-person shooter/beat-em-up is great. I've been playing it as often as I can get away... Just one more mission, just one more supply run – or I'm running away and want to get safe before shutting the game down."
104,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"An absolute great strategy game! Having played every single other wargame (European escalation, and Alpha), I have to say this one fits well. The number of units is great. Not sure exactly how many units there are, but there's a significant amount. Graphics are just beautiful, sounds are great, and the gameplay overall is epic. The in-game chat box at the main menu is very entertaining, I am not kidding. However, if you think this game is 'easy', or if you're new to the strategy genre, it could take you quite some time to get it down. Don't get upset, you will lose a lot of units. Just make sure you plan ahead, always have anti-air, and anti-tank."
105,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"I was initially skeptical about this game before I played it. Wasn't even sure about buying. I wasn't convinced by the whole portal gun and portals concept, even though I appreciate science fiction. Boy was I wrong. The humor and voice acting in this game are phenomenal. Just amazing. It's not overly cheesy (okay, it's sometimes cheesy). And the various story characters all have their own sense of humor. Those distinct characters do really have different personalities. And the level design; it's just rad."
107,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"Yes, this is a nostalgia trip for thirty-somethings who remember watching the ever-irritating Transformers cartoon. The voice actors for Optimus, Megatron, Bumblebee, and many others are back, instantly recognisable. The distinctive cartoon transformation sound effects are there. Graphically, the cell-shaded presentation is perfect, and very, very Generation One. But aside from that, it's actually a very fun, action-packed game. The combat mechanics are extremely well done, with transforming mid-fight seamlessly integrated into combos."
108,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"So I downloaded the game and played it for a little while, and it was nothing exceptional. I spent more time trying to log in than actually playing the game. There is a bug where it says there was an update to the terms of service or whatever, and whenever you clicked 'accept', it would just pop up again. You have to restart the client for it to work. Now, that's not that bad, but why do I need to link my Steam and GFACE accounts? They say it's for DLC, but why is that even necessary? It's also not reversible, so now I know that a company I don't care about has access to my Steam information. Now, the game itself is somewhat mediocre. It is easily recognizable as a Cod clone, except somehow they managed to make the gunplay worse... How is that even possible?"

What's not to love? https //www.youtube.com/watch?v=nygsb617tmo is an excellent port and a great entry point for new players to the series. Keep in mind that there is a significant amount of (skip-able) dialogue. As usual, I recommend using a gamepad, but I had no issues with a keyboard and mouse setup, which is both completely rebindable. The price is reasonable, and I wouldn't have been unhappy with a purchase. More than half the DLC is included for free, providing plenty to play with.

110,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"I experienced no performance issues even at release, and after all these patches, it plays really well. In my opinion, this is a great and fun game, although the format may be somewhat annoying (where the free-roam city area repopulates with new enemies every time you progress the story). I particularly enjoyed the 'dual play' segments (where you can play as Batman + 1 more) and the ability to use the controller for most segments of the game, but the mouse and keyboard for the tank combat segments was greatly appreciated. Driving your Batmobile around the free-roam city, including when chasing the APC commanders, is actually quite enjoyable once you figure out how to use the brakes to slide around corners (and when you master that, driving around the city is really quite enjoyable!)."
111,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"Damn fine FPS shooter - that's the bottom line. It's looks, sounds, and plays great - great FPS mechanics, nice story, cool characters, flawless voice acting, and a badass soundtrack. Not for the faint-hearted, though - some of those cutscenes were pretty darn cruel and vivid. But when a game overall is so great, it's easier to spot the flaws, and here they are as I saw 'em  no SLI support - what the heck? I had to put the game away until I upgraded my card, as it ran too poorly on my old dual GPU GTX 590. Make sure you have a fairly decent single GPU card. - stupidly small obstacles are often unclimbable."

I will break down this review into a few categories  graphics, controls, sound, and replayability. Graphics  the game has been set in a comic-like style, with very slick graphics and nice color schemes. It totally works for this game. The graphics can be set on 'high' without stressing your system. I run this game on an i5 Pentium processor, with an Nvidia GeForce 710M card and 8GB memory, and it runs like clockwork (Windows 8.1). Controls  the game can be played with a keyboard and mouse, but also with an Xbox controller."
113,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"You can see by the hours I've put into this game that I truly enjoy it. This is everything I wished a search game from Cod would be. But don't buy this game thinking it's like Cod, Battlefield, or any other shooter game. It's a game in its own class and should be treated as such. Can't tell you how many times I've heard new players ♥♥♥♥♥ and complain about getting killed really fast. Oh, God forbid you get shot in the face and ♥♥♥♥ing die. It's not like that doesn't happen in real life or anything. Okay, so I've been playing this game for a while now. I've thrown all kinds of money at it. One of the best MP games around. A good thing to play when you're not feeling CS GO."
114,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"I'm two hours in and I'm dying from this game. So, so funny. Gameplay is solid, art design is beautiful, music is surprisingly high-quality and fitting, the story/world has me interested, and the puzzles are fun. But the best thing about this game beyond all that is the comedy. If you've played any RPG since the dawn of video game RPGs, you'll laugh at the various jokes, parodies, and references; if you've never played an RPG before, you should still enjoy the game for its humor. If you played Final Fantasy 7 or X, you absolutely need to play this game; I had to stop playing after two hours to give my cheeks a break from laughing and smiling so much. What a delight so far."
115,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"I'm really sorry, I try to be supportive of free-to-play games and indie developers, but I didn't enjoy this game. The description sounded right up my alley, but the execution has done nothing for me. I love puzzle and exploration games, but I found this game to be unintuitive, and even after looking up how to progress, I still didn't find the gameplay fun. It lacks a pause button, which seems like a critical oversight, especially considering timed sequences. I feel like this game is more cut scene than it is game, and I end up just sitting around."
116,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"This game was where to even start. It was absolutely beautiful, from story to graphics, I was hooked. The story wasn't just some story, but actually felt like I was that person, trying to figure out what came next in the story that my character was telling. Gameplay was great and I learned a lot about myself through this game (mainly my fear of heights which I never had a problem with until the ice caverns). My gut churned the whole time, but I kept through for Uncle Fred! If you guys made a DLC or second game, I would be the first to buy it and recommend it to everyone I know. Thanks to everyone who was involved in making this, you made a truly beautiful game."
117,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"Sid Meier's Civilization Beyond Earth is a turn-based game where you build your civilization to a certain goal or 'victory'. In previous games, you were set on the earth's timeline, traversing periods like the Stone Age, Medieval Age, and the Modern Age; however, in this game, you are set in the future on a mission to colonize a new planet. What I enjoy about this game is that 2K took a new approach, adding new mechanics such as the affinity system and orbital layer. I didn't enjoy that with these new mechanics, the game could be overwhelming at times. I think what could be improved is incorporating some new artwork in the game, such as the environment you experience when communicating with another leader."
118,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"Great game! Tons of replayability and very fun zombie survival game! In my top 5 zombie games ever played. After playing 60+ hours, I can honestly say this is one of the better, more realistic zombie games. It's very much designed like a survival horror as you must save up your ammo, heal your own wounds when you bleed out, take pills when you're infected, etc. Also, I find zombies to feel very natural to be well-animated for a free-to-play game. P.S.  I would recommend getting 1 or 2 friends to play with, but the community is super friendly and you can usually make friends/talk with the people in the chat or over voice comms."
119,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"It's a shame I can't thoroughly recommend or enjoy this game, as from the short time I've played it, I know I'd be addicted if it didn't have the following two game breakers. No Aussie servers; one red bar puts you at a severe disadvantage, and creates unbearable lag. Mind you, I played through the offline training mode, and it was stuttering and lagging as well (how does that even happen?). Couple that with the poor ping, and it just ruins the game. Everything's like crazy - the menus, backgrounds, training, and in-game. I've never had this happen before with this card, and thought it might not like my OC."
120,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"Very late last night, I finished this story. The story is not very deep or interesting, but what makes it stand out is the storytelling. The atmosphere is filled to the brim, and the many collectibles do a great job at fleshing it out. I learned a lot about the world of Batman, so it was a little disappointing that so few bosses were in the game. Oh well, there's enough future games to rectify that. The combat is the right amount of challenge, but it's more on the easy side. Levelling up Batman wasn't very satisfying. It's the gadgets you upgrade and acquire during the campaign which add for nice new gameplay mechanics. Getting access to previously unreachable places makes for a nice sense of progression."
122,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"Bastion is a brilliant game, with a truly great storyline. Set after some calamity has occurred, you begin to rebuild on the bastion. There's quite a lot of choice in the game, with the choice of what to build to give you an advantage, what weapons to use and what power-ups to have on those weapons as well as what drinks to use to give you a bonus effect. The art style and music in the game is fantastic, everything looks so colorful at times, who says the apocalypse has to be dull. Best of all, the game has narration based on what you, the player, do. So if you end up picking up a weapon then switch it for another in the armory, the narration would say something about you taking along the new weapon."
123,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"I originally purchased this game during its early development, when the primary currency was spacebux, and there was no 'tech tree'. This was when the game was enjoyable. All the weapons at this point were equally overpowered, so there were no issues with imbalance; everyone could kill anyone at any time. Also, the game used to provide unlimited gun slots and five loadouts. You would expect that for a game with 'billions of guns', they would at least offer more than six weapon slots and three loadouts before you had to pay to acquire more. At one point, I had about three pages worth of guns, and was planning on new ideas for more, because personally, that's where I found it enjoyable."
124,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"This game was a surprising gem. One often sees rave reviews of certain products that are often misleading. In this case, the reviews reflect the fun of this neat little game. It is an odd mix between a classic 2d platformer and an MOBA, and does it with style. I found myself enjoying characters that I wouldn't enjoy in other MOBA games. I had expected this trait to continue, but decided to give a melee tank a go anyway. I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome and ended up trying out more as they were unlocked from playing games. The art style and interface is oddly charming. As such, I now use one of the characters as my avatar and a wallpaper from creating a card set for the game."
125,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"I just started playing, but I love this game. I put on my headphones and lose myself in the game for hours at a time. It's been a while since a game has had that effect on me. The music sets the mood, the sound effects are spot on, and the controls are perfect. I look forward to every combat, and they've optimized combat extremely well. I had my doubts about the naval combat system, but it's so much fun to lay waste to multiple fleets at a time! The only way to lose in this game is to fail to retreat. If the combat looks overwhelming, just get out of there, regroup, and counter-assault. Thanks, devs, for an amazing experience!"
126,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"The reboot of the Devil May Cry franchise has brought about many changes for the series, particularly for its protagonist, Dante. While fans of the original series may be upset at the change to their beloved character, it's certainly for the better; and this new game by Ninja Theory proves it. DMC serves as the perfect point for newcomers to jump into the series. It shows the origins of an arrogant, cynical Dante, and it chronicles his journey from cynicism to selflessness. Throughout, the game weaves a clear, narrative arc for the new Dante, making him a compelling character to watch."
127,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"Where do I start on this absolutely beautiful game? Its story is absolutely charming. It has so much detail put into it, and it is a bundle of happiness, bad puns, and annoying dogs, secrets. It is serious when it needs to be, but isn't a stranger to funny moments. The character design is on point, with there being various characters with various personalities and secrets to them. It stands out from other RPGs because you don't have to kill anyone, which is an unused concept in RPGs. With lots of inspiration from Earthbound, one of the best RPGs I've seen, you can tell that it is going to be good."
128,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"I recommend this solely because it's free and might be a more enjoyable experience for others. As for my experience, the game did nothing for me. Half the story relies on shock factor, but I was not shocked or emotionally moved in any way by this. Maybe I'm desensitized, or maybe it was too simple to warrant a reaction out of me. As for the other half of the game, it attempts to paint a picture of a person in mental decline. It deals with obsession, hallucinations, depression, and a few other things. In theory, it is a cool idea, but the game took me 10 minutes to complete, and that was with reading and taking in every little bit of information I could."
129,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"Do I even need to explain why Portal is amazing? Portal is a puzzle game that presents a concept then disappears. It's an amazing way to challenge your mind while still being fun. Although this game isn't as story-driven, it gave birth to one of the most popular games of 2011. I still play this game and beat it when I'm feeling bored, and I love to come back and see what gave birth to a legend and what is a legend. The gameplay is quite simple  use portals to your advantage, along with buttons that activate a part of the puzzle, and two buttons are in the game, one that you press and one that you need a cube to put on."

One fix increased my FPS from 60-90 to 80-120, and I can definitely recommend this. Since most of these reviews are about specs, I'll include mine  i5 6600k, Radeon RX480 (~200€), Z170 Pro - Gaming (~150€), 16GB DDR4 RAM (~70€), and ~650€ is definitely within the medium price range, though, granted, this rig is quite new. Almost constant 60+ FPS on high settings vsync enabled; I genuinely can't believe 90% of the comments saying they're rocking an overkill setup and getting 20fps."
131,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"Remember age of mythology? Yeah, it's been a long time since there's been an RTS game of such quality. Divinity  Dragon Commander reaches awfully close to these borders of my most favorite RTS game. Combine this with a huge risk-like grand strategy mode, and it hits the spot. I am not (read  try not to be) overly biased due to the fact that this game allows you to turn into a dragon, aiding your troops by supporting, attacking, and even commanding unit production, direction, and spawning at the very same time. Honestly, I do like the complex RTS games nowadays. Think of Civ V and so on. However, such games attempt to cram complex mechanics, charts, and resources all into one complicated game mode."

The devs are very active in the community, really showing in various discussion forums and dev diaries. The game's mechanics have a steep learning curve, but this breadth of strategy allows you a myriad of ways to reach goals and take advantage of certain situations. The game is almost infinitely replayable."
135,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"Warframe is a fun game for the initial hours of play. After those few enjoyable hours, you'll begin to see that the only thing left the game has to offer is repetition in its combat, enemies, and game play. The one major high point for the game is that the developers are working hard and do semi-frequent updates that generally include a lot of content from sweeping changes to some of the game's systems, new Warframes, and other tweaks/ features. It's a good game to play casually. Though I doubt it will hold your attention beyond a few months unless you just really like grinding. The upside to all of this is that the game is free, so I'd recommend trying it out."
136,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"This game is so. Very. Boring. I bought this game because I believed it was a PC version of 'Katamari Damacy', a popular and nice PS2 game. Sadly, it's far from it. In this game, you go about absorbing ever bigger things to grow bigger and absorb bigger things. But the gameplay isn't as smooth as it could be; the levels aren't inventive, and what's in it is a surreal horror show. I don't mean an entertaining horror show, but one that makes you rather depressed and rethink whether being alive is all it should be. Every 'living' creature in this game, from small pets to human beings, makes me wonder if the creators of this game had an interest in taxidermy."
137,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"Alright, let me explain a few things, as a person very interested in politics, I was very interested in this game when I first heard about it. I thought, ""Oh wow! A simulator of the road to becoming president! That sounds fun!"" Well, it really wasn't. The game starts you off and says you need to pick a side  Republican or Democrat, there is no independent, or third party. A little disappointed, but still optimistic, I carried on to see what I could do. I will give the game credit, the character customization, although limited, is pretty fun to mess around with."

Some keys are hard-coded and cannot be rebound. Bugs galore. My Pip-Boy disappeared permanently at one point and had to research console commands to get it back. You don't have to work for power armor; it's basically given to you from the beginning of the game, and power cores are everywhere in trader shops. The value of power armor has diminished greatly from previous Fallout games. The story is mediocre, everything about this game is mediocre except it doesn't crash every 10 minutes like Fallout 3. Very stable compared to Fallout 3."

What I liked  visuals up until the last level (ice caves), story is not that great, but the ending (after the closing credits) kind of made me not regret so much spending my time playing this game. What I disliked  visuals in the last level are uninteresting, gameplay in the last level gets much harder, making it become a frustrating experience of having to do a lot of things over and over again until you get it right."

Considering the time I wasted on the first Ghost Warrior (which was equally boring and I feel liberated when I finished it), I probably won't play it until the end."

For one thing, I have a vive and I'm much more interested in playing room-sized games with controllers. Beyond that, the game is initially awe-inspiring in the scale of its universe, but I also felt that same scale was a hindrance to my enjoyment. The learning curve was too steep for me, and the time to do anything interesting was too great."
144,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,game_review,"Hands down, my favorite first-person shooter of all time. Run and gun playstyles need not apply. Recoil and ballistics are realistic. Single hits to the chest, neck, or head from rifle-caliber weapons almost always result in death unless it just grazes you. Rounds drop over distance and short, controlled bursts are required if you wish to remain on target. There is no magical ammunition pool. If you reload halfway through your magazine all the time then you will have a pouch full of half-full mags. You can't run forever. If you sprint for a while, your aim will suffer as you gasp heavily until you have caught your breath. Rest your weapon on your elbows while prone or on a window sill to steady your aim. Accuracy suffers when standing."

I loved that game, however, it was unforgiving in the early stages, but rewarding when you did things right. As for XCOM2, I love it; the game plays pretty well for me on medium and I am running a GTX560 with 2GB of VRAM. At first, the game set it to high and it was running a bit sluggishly, but not to the point of being unplayable; but when I dropped it down to medium, it smoothed out. Not sure if I am just lucky when it comes to having issues with games or what, but it seems that most of the negative reviews sound like they are coming from some really entitled people."

The game has a low variety of equipment types and leveling skills, but still offers some variety and strategy to be had. It starts off quickly and maintains its pace. Despite its limitations, the game is still enjoyable. The best way to enhance this game is through mods. The fight for universe is easily the star, but the big fight for beef is also very good."

GM, whose own European operations are losing money, no longer wants to own the unprofitable Fiat unit.

The US firm is thought to be offering around $2 billion (£1.06 billion) to extricate itself from the arrangement.

Gordon Brown reallocated £512m from central to local government budgets in his pre-budget report on Thursday. Mr Raynsford said he had held some ""pretty frank discussions"" with fellow ministers over the plans. But he said local governments had to deliver good services without big council tax rises. The central government cash is part of a £1bn package to help local authorities in England keep next year's council tax rises below 5%, in what is likely to be a general election year."

University College London research claims cutting the limit from 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood to 50mg would save 65 lives a year. The findings are being published by the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety as MPs are due to vote on the government's road safety bill. The bill includes changes to speeding fines but not to the drink-drive limit. The research, carried out by transport expert Professor Richard Allsop, says cutting the limit would also lead to 230 fewer serious injuries on the UK's roads compared to 2003. He estimates that this would save the country £119 million a year. A previous estimate, contained in a 1998 Department of Transport document, suggested such a move could save 50 lives a year."
198,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"This paper presents a millimeter-scale CMOS 64x64 single charged particle radiation detector system for external beam cancer radiotherapy. A 1x1 μm² diode measures energy deposition by a single charged particle in the depletion region, and the array design provides a large detection area of 512x512 μm². Instead of sensing the voltage drop caused by radiation, the proposed system measures the pulse width, i.e., the time it takes for the voltage to return to its baseline. This eliminates the need for using power-hungry and large analog-to-digital converters. A prototype ASIC is fabricated in TSMC 65 nm LP CMOS process and consumes an average static power of 0.535 mW under 1.2 V analog and digital power supply. The functionality of the entire system is successfully verified in a clinical 67.5 MeV proton beam setting."

200,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"Optomechanics and electromechanics have made it possible to prepare macroscopic mechanical oscillators in their quantum ground states, in quadrature squeezed states, and in entangled states of motion. In addition to coaxing ever larger and more tangible objects into a regime of quantum behavior, this new capability has encouraged ideas of using mechanical oscillators in the processing and communication of quantum information and as precision force sensors operating beyond the standard quantum limit. But the effectively linear interaction between motion and light or electricity precludes access to the broader class of quantum states of motion, such as cat states or energy squeezed states. Indeed, early optomechanical proposals noted the possibility to escape this restriction by creating strong quadratic coupling of motion to light. Although there have been experimental demonstrations of quadratically coupled optomechanical systems, these have not yet accessed nonclassical states of motion."

Unfortunately, the evaluations can be manipulated using fake reviews (""spams"") by professional spammers, who have learned increasingly insidious and powerful spamming strategies by adapting to deployed detectors. Spamming strategies are hard to capture, as they can vary quickly over time, across spammers and target products, and more critically, remain unknown in most cases. Furthermore, most existing detectors focus on detection accuracy, which is not well-aligned with the goal of maintaining the trustworthiness of product evaluations. To address the challenges, we formulate a minimax game where the spammers and spam detectors compete with each other on their practical goals that are not solely based on detection accuracy."
202,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"We developed single-shot shaped pulses for ultra-high fidelity population transfer on a 3-level quantum system in lambda configuration. To ensure high fidelity, we employ the Lewis-Riesenfeld (L-R) method to derive a family of solutions leading to an exact transfer, where the solutions follow a single dynamical mode of the L-R invariant. Among this family, we identify a tracking solution with a single parameter to control simultaneously the fidelity of the transfer, the population of the excited state, and robustness. We define a measure of the robustness of an ultra-high-fidelity transfer as the minimum percentile deviation on the pulse areas at which the infidelity rises above 10^(-4). The robustness of our shaped pulses is found superior to that of Gaussian and adiabatically-optimized pulses for moderate pulse areas."
203,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"In this paper, we study the landscape of the population negative log-likelihood function of Gaussian mixture models with a general number of components. Due to non-convexity, there exist multiple local minima that are not globally optimal, even when the mixture is well-separated. We show that all local minima share the same form of structure, which partially identifies the component centers of the true mixture, in the sense that each local minimum involves a non-overlapping combination of fitting multiple Gaussians to a single true component and fitting a single Gaussian to multiple true components. Our results apply to the setting where the true mixture components satisfy a certain separation condition, and are valid even when the number of components is over-or under-specified. For Gaussian mixtures with three components, we obtain sharper results in terms of the scaling with the separation between the components."

This orbifold is defined as a quotient by some suitable subgroup g of the phase symmetries of the hypersurface x_m in the weighted projective space, cut out by a quasi-homogeneous polynomial w_m. The first, Berglund-Hubsch-Krawitz (BHK) construction, uses another weighted projective space and the quotient of a new hypersurface x_mt inside it by some dual group g^t. In the second, Batyrev construction, the mirror partner is constructed as a hypersurface in the toric variety defined by the reflexive polytope dual to the polytope associated with the original Calabi-Yau orbifold. We give a simple evidence of the equivalence of these two constructions, demonstrating that they are equivalent."

In this hybrid model, a metabolic energy minimization strategy is combined in a race process, with a non-linear description of mass center movement, trying to reproduce walk-run transition behavior. The results of experimental data, for different speed regimes, indicate that the perimeter of the trajectory of the mass center is a relevant quantity in quantifying this dynamic."
206,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"We introduce a novel mixed-variable symplectic (mvs) integrator for planetary systems, which fully resolves close encounters. The method is based on a time regularization that maintains the stability properties of the symplectic integrators while reducing the effective step size during close encounters. We employ a high-order mvs scheme, enabling integration with large time steps far from close encounters. We demonstrate that this algorithm can resolve almost exact collisions (i.e., with a mutual separation of a fraction of the physical radius) using the same time-step as in weakly perturbed problems, such as the solar system. We show the long-term behavior of systems with six super-Earths experiencing strong scattering over 50,000 years. We compare our algorithm to hybrid methods, such as Mercury, and find that for an equivalent cost, we achieve much better energy conservation."
207,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"Entanglement is a key resource for quantum information processing. A widely used tool for detecting entanglement is entanglement witness, where the measurement of the witness operator is guaranteed to be positive for all separable states and can be negative for certain entangled states. In reality, due to the exponentially increasing Hilbert-space dimension with respect to the system size, it is very challenging to construct an efficient entanglement witness for general multipartite entangled states. For n-partite GHZ-like states, the most robust witness scheme requires n+1 local measurement settings and can tolerate up to 1/2 white noise. As a comparison, the most efficient witness for GHZ-like states only needs two local measurement settings and can tolerate up to 1/3 white noise."
208,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"Within general relativity, the unique stationary solution of an isolated black hole is the Kerr spacetime, which has a peculiar multipolar structure depending only on its mass and spin. We develop a general method to extract the multipole moments of arbitrary stationary spacetimes and apply it to a large family of horizonless microstate geometries. The latter can break the axial and equatorial symmetry of the Kerr metric and have a much richer multipolar structure, which provides a portal to constrain fuzzball models phenomenologically. We find numerical evidence that all multipole moments are typically greater (in absolute value) than those of a Kerr black hole with the same mass and spin. Current measurements of the quadrupole moment of black-hole candidates could place only mild constraints on fuzzballs, while future gravitational-wave detections of extreme mass-ratio inspirals with the space mission LISA will improve these bounds by orders of magnitude."
209,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"Reasoning about graphs evolving over time is a challenging concept in many domains, such as bioinformatics, physics, and social networks. We consider a common case in which edges can be short-term interactions (e.g., messaging) or long-term structural connections (e.g., friendship). In practice, long-term edges are often specified by humans. Human-specified edges can be both expensive to produce and suboptimal for the downstream task. To alleviate these issues, we propose a model based on temporal point processes and variational autoencoders that learns to infer temporal attention between nodes by observing node communication. As temporal attention drives between-node feature propagation, using the dynamics of node interactions to learn this key component provides more flexibility while simultaneously avoiding issues associated with human-specified edges."

The PCW consists of two parallel nanobeams with a 240-nanometer vacuum gap between the beams. Models are developed and validated for transducing beam motion to phase and amplitude modulation of a weak optical probe propagating in a guided mode of the PCW for probe frequencies far from and near to the dielectric band edge. Since our PCW has been designed for near-field atom trapping, this research provides a foundation for evaluating possible deleterious effects of thermal motion on optical atomic traps near the surfaces of PCWs. Longer-term goals are to achieve strong atom-mediated links between individual phonons of vibration and single photons propagating in the GMs of the PCW, thereby enabling opto-mechanics at the quantum level with atoms, photons, and phonons."

In particular, the restriction homomorphisms between the orthogonal, unitary, and symplectic groups of adjacent dimensions are naturally split epimorphisms. The interest in the splitting comes from equivariant stable homotopy theory. The equivariant stable homotopy groups of every global spectrum form a global Mackey functor, so the splittings imply that certain long exact homotopy group sequences separate into short exact sequences. For the real and complex global Thom spectra $\mathbf{mo}$ and $\mathbf{mu}$, the splittings imply the regularity of various Euler classes related to the tautological representations of $o(n)$ and $u(n)$."

Nevertheless, building speech processing models that handle such a wide variety of conditions would be particularly useful for language acquisition studies, where researchers are interested in the quantity and quality of the speech that children hear and produce, as well as for early diagnosis and measuring the effects of remediation. In this paper, we present our approach to designing an open-source neural network to classify audio segments into vocalizations produced by the child wearing the recording device, vocalizations produced by other children, adult male speech, and adult female speech. To this end, we gathered diverse child-centered corpora, which sums up to a total of 260 hours of recordings and covers 10 languages."
214,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"Density-based clustering relies on the idea of linking groups to specific features of the probability distribution underlying the data. The reference to a true, yet unknown, population structure allows framing the clustering problem in a standard inferential setting, where the concept of ideal population clustering is defined as the partition induced by the true density function. The nonparametric formulation of this approach, known as modal clustering, draws a correspondence between the groups and domains of attraction of the density modes. Operationally, a nonparametric density estimate is required, and a proper selection of the amount of smoothing, governing the shape of the density and hence possibly the modal structure, is crucial to identify the final partition. In this work, we address the issue of density estimation for modal clustering from an asymptotic perspective."
215,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"The tails of diboson production at the LHC are sensitive to the interference between the standard model and higher-dimensional operators parameterizing the effects of heavy new physics. However, helicity selection rules for the diboson scattering amplitudes set an obstruction to the naive interference contributions of dimension six operators, causing the total diboson rate correction's leading contribution to cancel. In this case, carefully measuring the azimuthal decay angles ""resurrects"" the interference, recouping sensitivity to the ""non-interfering"" operators. We explore these signatures in detail, and find that the EFT uncertainties associated with higher-dimensional operators are uniquely well-suppressed by the construction of an asymmetry variable which is only generated by these non-interfering operators, relegating the effects of higher-dimensional, interfering operators to the same status as statistical errors in this observable."

However, academic statistics has often frowned upon data analyses with a causal objective. The introduction of the term ""data science"" provides a historic opportunity to redefine data analysis in such a way that it naturally accommodates causal inference from observational data. Like others before, we organize the scientific contributions of data science into three classes of tasks  description, prediction, and counterfactual prediction (which includes causal inference). An explicit classification of data science tasks is necessary to discuss the data, assumptions, and analytics required to successfully accomplish each task. We argue that a failure to adequately describe the role of subject-matter expert knowledge in data analysis is a source of widespread misunderstandings about data science."
217,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"The weak gravity conjecture (WGC) demands the existence of super-extremal particles in any consistent quantum theory of gravity. The standard lore is that these particles are introduced to ensure that extremal black holes are either unstable or marginally stable, but it is unclear what is wrong if this doesn't happen. This note shows that, for a generic Einstein quantum theory of gravity in AdS, exactly stability of extremal black branes is in tension with rigorously proven quantum information theorems about entanglement entropy. Avoiding the contradiction leads to a non-perturbative version of the WGC, which reduces to the usual statement at weak coupling. The argument is general, and it does not rely on either supersymmetry or a particular UV completion, assuming only the validity of Einsteinian gravity, effective field theory, and holography."
218,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"Understanding how strongly correlated two-dimensional (2D) systems can give rise to unconventional superconductivity with high critical temperatures is one of the major unsolved problems in condensed matter physics. Ultracold 2D Fermi gases have emerged as clean and controllable model systems to study the interplay of strong correlations and reduced dimensionality, but direct evidence of superfluidity in these systems has been missing. Here, we demonstrate superfluidity in an ultracold 2D Fermi gas by moving a periodic potential through the system and observing no dissipation below a critical velocity v_c. We measure v_c as a function of interaction strength and find a maximum in the crossover regime between bosonic and fermionic superfluidity. Our measurement establishes ultracold Fermi gases as a powerful tool for studying the influence of reduced dimensionality on strongly correlated superfluids, with a clear understanding of the underlying physics."
219,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"Ordinary differential equation (ODE) is a mathematical model used in many application areas, including climatology, bioinformatics, and chemical engineering, with its intuitive appeal to modeling. Despite ODE's wide usage in modeling, frequent absence of their analytic solutions makes it difficult to estimate ODE parameters from the data, especially when the model has many variables and parameters. This paper proposes a Bayesian ODE parameter estimating algorithm, which is fast and accurate even for models with many parameters. The proposed method approximates an ODE model with a state-space model based on equations of a numeric solver. It allows fast estimation by avoiding computations of a whole numerical solution in the likelihood. The posterior is obtained by a variational Bayes method, specifically, the approximate Riemannian conjugate gradient method (Hönkelä et al."

We find that the differential conductance and induced pairing amplitudes strongly depend on the angle between the junction direction in real space and the axis separating the Weyl nodes in momentum space, which strongly influences the transport properties. We identify the influence of a chiral chemical potential, i.e., the electron population imbalance between Weyl nodes of opposite chirality, on the transport characteristics of the junction. Remarkably, we observe a net spin polarization of Cooper pairs that are generated via Andreev reflection in the two WSM regions. The spin polarization is opposite in the two WSM regions and highly sensitive to the chirality imbalance and excitation energy."
221,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"Metal ion implantation into ceramics has been demonstrated to be an effective and controllable technique for tailoring the surface electrical conductivity of the ceramic piece, and this approach has been used in a number of applications. Importantly, it provides a method for grading the voltage drop across high-voltage insulators, thereby increasing the maximum operational voltage that can be applied across the insulator without surface flashover. However, a concern for the use of the method is the long-term stability of the implantation-induced conductivity, especially if the implanted metal species is readily oxidized. Here, we report on our examination of the long-term behavior of the surface conductivity of titanium-implanted alumina. The results indicate that after an initial drop of up to 40% in the first few weeks after implantation, the conductivity shows only a very slow decrease of around 10% over the following year."
222,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"We introduce a novel Skyrme-like conserved current in the effective theory of pions and vector mesons, rooted in the concept of hidden local symmetry. The associated charge is equivalent to the skyrmion charge for any smooth configuration. Moreover, singular configurations can be identified as n_f=1 baryons charged under the new symmetry. Under this identification, vector mesons assume the role of Chern-Simons vector fields residing on the quantum Hall droplet that forms the n_f=1 baryon. We propose that this current is the correct effective expression for the baryon current at low energies. This proposal provides a unified picture for the two types of baryons, enabling a natural transformation between them. Furthermore, Chern-Simons dualities on the droplet can be viewed as a consequence of Seiberg-like duality between gluons and vector mesons."

We theoretically investigate how the superposition of both effects influences superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator/superconductor junctions' transport properties. Transverse momentum-dependent skew tunneling of Cooper pairs through the spin-active ferromagnetic insulator interface generates sizable transverse Hall supercurrents, which we refer to as anomalous Josephson Hall effect currents. We generalize the Furusaki-Tsukada formula, initially established to quantify usual tunneling Josephson current flows, to evaluate the transverse current components and demonstrate that their amplitudes are widely adjustable via the spin-orbit coupling strengths or the superconducting phase difference across the junction. As a clear spectroscopic fingerprint of Josephson junctions, well-localized subgap bound states form around the interface."
224,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"Following the suggestion from the Monte Carlo experiments in Jimenez (2020), that dipoles are as important to the dynamics of decaying two-dimensional turbulence as individual vortex cores, it is found that the kinetic energy of this flow is carried by elongated streams formed by the concatenation of dipoles. Vortices separate into a family of small fast-moving cores, and another family of larger slowly moving ones, which can be described as `frozen' into a slowly evolving `crystal'. The kinematics of both families are very different, and only the former is self-similar. The latter is responsible for most of the kinetic energy of the flow, and its vortices form the dipoles and the streams. Mechanisms are discussed for the growth of this slow component, and the dynamics of the flow are studied in detail."

In this article, we provide improved upper bounds for the quantum hitting time that can be applied to several continuous-time quantum walk-based quantum algorithms. In particular, we apply our techniques to the glued-trees problem, improving their hitting time upper bound by a polynomial factor  from o(n^5) to o(n^2log n).

This, however, often results in a challenging nonlinear problem, for which the optimal solution is infeasible to implement.

A corpus of potential seeds will often contain thousands of similar inputs. This lack of diversity can lead to wasted fuzzing effort by exhaustive mutation from all available seeds. To address this, fuzzers come with distillation tools that select the smallest subset of seeds that triggers the same range of instrumentation data points as the full corpus. Common practice suggests that minimizing the number and cumulative size of the seeds leads to more efficient fuzzing, which we explore systematically. We present results of 34 CPU-years of fuzzing with five distillation approaches to understand their impact in finding bugs in real-world software."

The agents can be divided into several groups, each of which has similar state transition structures, and can be relabeled into the same template. Based on the template, a scalable supervisor, whose state size and computational cost are independent of the number of agents, is designed for the case of partial observation. The scalable supervisor under partial observation does not need to be recomputed regardless of how many agents are added to or removed from the system. We generalize our earlier results to partial observation by proposing sufficient conditions for safety and maximal permissiveness of the scalable least restrictive supervisor on the template level. An example is provided to illustrate the proposed scalable supervisory synthesis."

Moreover, this approach uses, for the first time in the field of ENF, a temporal window, not necessarily rectangular, at the stage preceding spectral estimation. Krylov matrices are employed for fast implementation of matrix inversions. The proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in ENF estimation, when a short time window of 1 second is employed in power recordings.

Here, we studied the fluorescence anomalous saturating effect of the nitrogen vacancy defect in diamond. The fluorescence reduction was observed with high power laser excitation. It increased the non-linearity of the fluorescence emission, and changed the spatial frequency distribution of the fluorescence image. We used a differential excitation protocol to extract the high spatial frequency information. By modulating the excitation laser's power, the spatial resolution of imaging was improved approximately 1.6 times compared to the confocal microscopy. Due to the simplicity of the experimental setup and data processing, we expect this method can be used for improving the spatial resolution of sensing and biological labeling with defects in solids."
234,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"When random effects are correlated with sample design variables, the usual approach of employing individual survey weights (constructed to be inversely proportional to the unit survey inclusion probabilities) no longer produces asymptotically unbiased inference. We construct a weight-exponentiated formulation for the random effects distribution that achieves unbiased inference for generating hyperparameters of the random effects. We contrast our approach with frequentist methods that rely on numerical integration, revealing that only the Bayesian method achieves both unbiased estimation with respect to the sampling design distribution and consistency with respect to the population generating distribution. Our simulations and real data example for a survey of business establishments demonstrate the utility of our approach across different modeling formulations and sampling designs, serving as a capstone for recent developmental efforts that combine traditional survey estimation approaches with the Bayesian modeling paradigm, providing a bridge across the two rich but disparate sub-fields."

For the first time, it was found that in a mesogenic polymer, in contrast to low-molecular-weight mesogens, the relaxation of the electric birefringence of a melt above the temperature of the nematic-isotropic phase transition can be presented by a sum of several exponential processes, two of which play a decisive role. These main processes replace each other in a temperature range of about 50 degrees. Dielectric spectroscopy also made it possible to distinguish two processes of orientational relaxation  the first is due to rotation of the side mesogenic groups, and the second is associated with motion of the main chain segments."

How to optimize discrete hash bits is always the focus in deep hashing methods.

However, this paradigm may make more and more hash bits stuck into the wrong saturated area of the activation functions and never escaped. We call this problem ""dead bits problem."" Besides, the existing quantization loss will exacerbate dbp as well. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective gradient amplifier which acts before activation functions to alleviate dbp."

The former is constrained by disappearing charged track searches at the LHC and by dark matter direct detection experiments, while the latter is constrained by existing multilepton collider searches. We find that a two-step electroweak phase transition involving a stable triplet with a negative quadratic term is ruled out by direct detection searches, while an unstable triplet with a mass less than 230 GeV is excluded at 95% confidence level."
239,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"This paper demonstrates that the eccentric debris rings observed around the stars Fomalhaut and HD 202628 are narrower than expected in the standard eccentric planet perturbation scenario, referred to as the pericenter glow. The standard scenario assumes an initially circular and narrow belt of planetesimals at semi-major axis a, whose eccentricity is increased to ef after the gas disc has dispersed by secular perturbations from an eccentric planet, resulting in a belt of width 2ae_f. In a minor modification of this scenario, narrower belts can arise if the planetesimals are initially eccentric, which could result from earlier planet perturbations during the gas-rich protoplanetary disc phase. However, a primordial eccentricity could alternatively be caused by instabilities that increase the disc eccentricity, without the need for any planets."
240,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"An electron typically possesses only one type of kinetic energy, but could it have more, due to its spin and charge, or by exciting other electrons? In one dimension (1D), the physics of interacting electrons is captured well at low energies by the Tomonaga-Luttinger-liquid (TLL) model, yet little has been observed experimentally beyond this linear regime. Here, we report on measurements of many-body modes in 1D gated-wires using a tunnelling spectroscopy technique. We observe two separate Fermi seas at high energies, associated with spin and charge excitations, together with the emergence of three additional 1D'replica' modes that strengthen with decreasing wire length."
241,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"The assembly history of the Milky Way is currently being unveiled thanks to the data provided by the Gaia mission. It is likely that the globular cluster system of our galaxy has followed a similarly intricate formation path. To constrain this formation path, we explore the link between the globular clusters and the known merging events that the Milky Way has experienced. To this end, we combined the kinematic information provided by Gaia for almost all galactic clusters, with the largest sample of cluster ages available after carefully correcting for systematic errors. To identify clusters with a common origin we analyzed their dynamical properties, particularly in the space of integrals of motion. The results show that about 40% of the clusters likely formed in situ."
242,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"The estimation of the intrinsic dimension of a dataset is a fundamental step in many dimensionality reduction techniques. This article illustrates intrinsic, an R package that implements novel state-of-the-art likelihood-based estimators of the intrinsic dimension of a dataset. In detail, the methods included in this package are the two-nn, gride, and Hidalgo models. To allow these novel estimators to be easily accessible, the package contains a few high-level, intuitive functions that rely on a broader set of efficient, low-level routines. Intrinsic encompasses models that fall into two categories  homogeneous and heterogeneous intrinsic dimension estimators. The first category contains the two-nn and gride models. The functions dedicated to these two methods carry out inference under both the frequentist and Bayesian frameworks. In the second category, we find Hidalgo, a Bayesian mixture model, for which an efficient Gibbs sampler is implemented."

Here, two physical RC systems based on a single magnetic skyrmion memristor (MSM) and 24 spin-torque nano-oscillators (STNO) were proposed and modeled to process image classification tasks and nonlinear dynamic system prediction, respectively. Based on our micromagnetic simulation results on the nonlinear responses of MSM and STNO with current pulses stimulation, handwritten digits recognition tasks domesticates that an RC system using one single MSM has outstanding performance on image classification. Additionally, complex unknown nonlinear dynamic problems can also be well solved by a physical RC system consisting of 24 STNO confirmed in a second-order nonlinear dynamic system and narma10 tasks."
244,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"Ranking algorithms play a crucial role in online platforms, ranging from search engines to recommender systems. In this paper, we identify a surprising consequence of popularity-based rankings  the fewer items reporting a given signal, the higher the share of overall traffic they collectively attract. This few-get-richer effect emerges in settings where there are few distinct classes of items, such as left-leaning news sources versus right-leaning news sources, and items are ranked based on their popularity. We demonstrate analytically that the few-get-richer effect arises when people tend to click on top-ranked items and have heterogeneous preferences for the classes of items. Using simulations, we analyze how the strength of the effect changes with assumptions about the setting and human behavior. We also test our predictions experimentally in an online experiment with human participants. Our findings have important implications for understanding the spread of misinformation."
245,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,paper_abstract,"Weight pruning has been widely acknowledged as a straightforward and effective method to eliminate redundancy in deep neural networks (DNNs), thereby achieving acceleration on various platforms. However, most of the pruning techniques are essentially trade-offs between model accuracy and regularity which lead to impaired inference accuracy and limited on-device acceleration performance. To solve the problem, we introduce a new sparsity dimension, namely pattern-based sparsity that comprises pattern and connectivity sparsity, and becoming both highly accurate and hardware-friendly. With carefully designed patterns, the proposed pruning unprecedentedly and consistently achieves accuracy enhancement and better feature extraction ability on different DNN structures and datasets, and our pattern-aware pruning framework also achieves pattern library extraction, pattern selection, pattern and connectivity pruning and weight training simultaneously. Our approach on the new pattern-based sparsity naturally fits into compiler optimization for highly efficient DNN execution on mobile platforms."

Constructing a more closely matched control group by matching a subset of the overall control group to the treated group may result in less bias. We study this phenomenon in simulation studies. We study the effect of mountain removal mining on mortality using a difference-in-differences analysis that makes use of the increase in mountain removal mining following the 1990 clean air act amendments. For a difference-in-differences analysis of the effect of mountain removal mining on mortality, we constructed a more closely matched control group and found a 95% confidence interval that contains substantial adverse effects along with no effect and small beneficial effects."

Carbon works in a natural cycle, present in all living things  in the soil, oceans, atmosphere, and rocks deep underground.

Natural events like volcanic eruptions release some of the carbon trapped in rock. Humans release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere through activities like burning fossil fuels, which is around 60 times more than volcanic activity each year."
289,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,speech,"Even nature's most reviled creatures possess important secrets, but who would desire a swarm of cockroaches approaching them? Yet, one of the greatest differences between natural and human technologies lies in robustness. Robust systems are stable in complex and novel environments. Remarkably, cockroaches can self-stabilize while running over rough terrain. When we attached a jet pack to them or subjected them to a perturbation like an earthquake, we found that their wonderfully tuned legs enable them to self-stabilize without utilizing any brainpower. They can traverse complex terrain like grass effortlessly, without becoming destabilized. We discovered a new behavior where, due to their shape, they automatically roll onto their side to navigate this artificial test section of grass. Robust systems can perform multiple tasks with the same structure. Here's a new behavior we've discovered."

And so, I'd like to cheer you up with one of the great, albeit largely unknown, commercial success stories of the past 20 years. Comparable, in its own very peculiar way, to the achievements of Microsoft or Google. And it's an industry that has bucked the current recession with equanimity. I refer to organized crime. Now, organized crime has been around for a very long time, I hear you say, and these would be wise words, indeed. But in the last two decades, it has experienced an unprecedented expansion, now accounting for roughly 15 percent of the world's GDP. I like to call it the global shadow economy, or MCMafia, for short. So, what triggered this extraordinary growth in cross-border crime?"
291,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,speech,"If you ask people about what part of psychology do they think is hard, and you say, ""well, what about thinking and emotions?"" most people will say, ""emotions are terribly hard. They're incredibly complex. They're incredibly complex. They're incredibly complicated. They can't — I have no idea of how they work. But thinking is really very straightforward  it's just sort of some kind of logical reasoning, or something. But that's not the hard part. ""So here's a list of problems that come up."
293,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,speech,"When I look in the mirror today, I see a justice and education scholar at Columbia University, a youth mentor, an activist, and a future New York State senator. (Cheering!) I see all of that and a man who spent a quarter of his life in state prison – six years, to be exact, starting as a teenager on Rikers Island for an act that nearly cost a man his life. But what got me from there to here wasn't the punishment I faced as a teenager in adult prison or the harshness of our legal system. Instead, it was a learning environment of a classroom that introduced me to something I didn't think was possible for me or our justice system as a whole; a few weeks before my release on parole, a counselor encouraged me to enroll in a new college course being offered within the prison."
294,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,speech,"What do you think when you look at me? A woman of faith, an expert, maybe even a sister, or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist, or just an airport security line delay. That one's actually true. If some of your perceptions were negative, I don't really blame you. That's just how the media has been portraying people who look like me. One study found that 80% of news coverage about Islam and Muslims is negative. And studies show that Americans say that most don't know a Muslim. I guess people don't talk to their Uber drivers well, for those of you who have never met a Muslim, it's great to meet you."
295,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,speech,"We need to build a weather service for water. Yet, until we collectively demand accountability, the incentives to fund it will not exist. The first time I spoke at a conference was here at TED, eight years ago. Fresh out of grad school, little did I know that in those few minutes onstage, I was framing the questions I was going to be asked for the next decade. And, like many 20-somethings, I expected to solve the world's problems – more specifically, the world's water problems – with my technology. I had a lot to learn. It was seductive, believing that our biggest water quality problems persist because they're so hard to identify. And I presumed that we just needed simpler, faster, and more affordable solutions. I was wrong."
296,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,speech,"Indeed, for 20 years, I worked in finance. I knew everything about finance, for sure. I knew the global economy because it was my life. All the topics that you could bring up about ecology, the end of the world, etc., that I knew like the back of my hand, I didn't really believe in them. In 2007, an extremely unusual event occurred, one that you may remember, the subprime crisis, the collapse of big American banks. It was an electric shock. I had a few stormy conversations with my wife about the matter, about my job, on the limits of the model. Besides the crisis, I realized that I was completely wrong, that we were heading for disaster."
297,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,speech,"So, I'll be speaking to you using language because I can. This is one of the magical abilities that we humans have. We can transmit really complicated thoughts to one another. So, I'm doing right now, I'm making sounds with my mouth as I'm exhaling. I'm making tones and hisses and puffs, and those are creating air vibrations in the air. Those air vibrations are traveling to you, they're hitting your eardrums, and then your brain takes those vibrations from your eardrums and transforms them into thoughts. I hope that's happening. So, because of this ability, we're able to transmit our ideas across vast reaches of space and time."
298,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,speech,"There's a quote by activist and punk rock musician Jello Biafra that I adore. He says, ""Don't hate the media; be the media."" As an artist, I appreciate working with media and technology because A, I'm familiar with them and I'm drawn to their power. And B, I abhor them and I'm intimidated by their power. (laughter) I recall watching an interview in 2003 between Fox News host Tony Snow and then-US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. They were discussing the recent invasion of Iraq, and Rumsfeld was asked, ""We're hearing about our body counts, but we never hear about theirs, why?"" His response was, ""We don't release body counts on other people."""
299,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,speech,"Baking apple pie? The discount orange warehouse has you covered! A fruit's a fruit, right? It's 1988, and scientist James Hansen has just testified to the United States Congress that global warming trends are caused by human activity, and will pose an increasing threat to humanity in the future. Well, well. That's unusually prescient for a human. Looking for a wedding dress? Try a new take on a timeless classic. It's sleek, flattering, and modest—just like the traditional dress. It's 1997, and the United States Senate has called a hearing about global warming. Some expert witnesses point out that past periods in Earth's history were warmer than the 20th century."
300,hybrid,none,none,polish_10,speech,"Someone once said that politics is, of course, ""showbiz for the unsavory."" So, on that basis, I feel like I've really arrived. The other thing to consider is what an honor it is, as a politician, to give a TED Talk, particularly here in the UK, where the reputation of politics, following the expenses scandal, has sunk so low. There was even a story recently that scientists had thought about replacing rats in their experiments with politicians. And someone asked, ""Why?"" And they said, ""Well, there's no shortage of politicians; no one really minds what happens to them, and, after all, there are some things that rats just won't do."" (laughter) Now, I know you all love data, so I'm starting with a data-rich slide."
