1,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"Another week flew by. I drove past the new house yesterday, and the front window was covered in boxes. We might receive the keys at closing, which is exciting. If everything goes well this week, we will be set for closing a week from Wednesday. I was up until after 3:00 a.m. last night watching movies with Bethany. There's been a lot of movie-watching going on around here lately. Here's my rundown: last night we watched ""Thirteen,"" a movie every mother of a teen should see. It was better than I expected. Then we watched ""Gigli,"" and it was just as bad as the media said, but we had to see for ourselves."
2,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"Summer television used to be a dead zone filled with reruns, but now there are two great new shows that I have been watching religiously for the past week. One of them is ""Blow Out,"" which astonishingly lacks any gay presence despite its flamboyant concept. In this show, hairstylist Jonathan Antin aims to expand his immensely popular West Hollywood salon by opening a second location in Beverly Hills. Normally, I wouldn't care, but as I was channel surfing, I glimpsed Jonathan, with his intriguing blend of narcissism and dullness, surveying an empty space on Rodeo Drive. He declared, ""I am going to build here the greatest salon in the history of the world!"" Instantly, I was captivated. Not since Rocco have I found someone so compelling to watch on TV."
3,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"What a week... My right shoulder has tendinitis, right under my shoulder blade. When I move my arm too much, especially using a computer mouse, it causes a lot of pain. I can't move it much now because I was updating my website and working on other online tasks. I can barely muster the strength to draw anything. Lack of sleep worsens my pain. I'm not too happy right now, but I'll get better. My mom's surgery went okay. Some of her eyesight has returned, and she can now see fuzzy shapes and distinguish colors. Other than that, she's still quite blind. Hopefully, she'll fully regain her vision soon."
4,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"Attempted laundry today with the kids in tow and quickly realized how the simplest tasks can become quite an ordeal. Remarkably, I discovered how sweet total strangers can be, just because they feel like it. Trust me, it wasn't because they were trying for anything more; I had kid drool on me and was wearing my 'wash-day' outfit. Plus, I'm pretty sure I won't be bathing for a while, so there wasn't even an olfactory incentive! Currently, I'm doing two things: composing a post and watching the collected No Doubt videos, both while sitting at my desk in my room."
5,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"It's 11:14 PM MST, and I'm sitting in my bedroom repairing the personal computer of my job's personnel director. I don't mind doing it, but I sometimes wonder how often I end up fixing someone else's computer as a favor. I'm happy to help people this way, but where do you draw the line to avoid being taken advantage of? In the past couple of weeks, I've stayed up late reading and such, so I was looking forward to going to bed early—until I realized it would be more prudent to return this computer to its owner. *laugh* No rest for the weary, right? So, I found myself watching Joe Schmo 2 again tonight."
6,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"Remind me, what did I write about before this? Or, a continuation in the ""is this a date?"" saga. After the weird lunch, my confidence was shaken, and I realized I forgot to share an important part of the story. Before Pat showed up for lunch, Dustin started talking about what a nice guy Pat is and how he’s trying to find a girlfriend for him. I was listening, nodding, and realizing that we were talking more about finding Dustin’s best friend a girl than discussing whatever you discuss with a stranger over pink lemonade. I excused myself to the bathroom, looked in the mirror, and silently asked myself: Am I being pawned off to the other guy? Is this what happens now?"
7,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"I would like everyone to think before they act. Specifically, I'd like each person in the world to think before they get out of bed in the morning and commit to thoughtful behavior all day. If someone isn't prepared to do so, I wish they'd just stay in bed. I'm really tired of dealing with foolishness. I'm not claiming to be the smartest person around, but I'm not talking about anything that requires a lot of intelligence, so I think it's fair to criticize the exceptionally thoughtless. Let's see if I can keep this rant focused on a few specific types, and we can save the rest for another day. Sound good? Great."
8,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"Two problems with the scenario outlined in my previous post: 1. Bush is indeed stimulating the economy, but in an ineffective manner. Robert Rubin, speaking to NPR's Marketplace, mentioned that Bush could have achieved similar stimulus effects without the burden of long-term debt by enacting different, temporary tax cuts that would aid low- and middle-income individuals. Ah, Robert Rubin—the mere mention of his name delights us. Quick: can you name a Bush administration cabinet official on the domestic side who has Rubin's gravitas? Still thinking? It’ll come to you... 2. We can't entrust Republicans with control only in wartime, as they've cleverly invented an endless global 'war on terrorism.'"

On Saturday, went to work and then out with Joe and Rach; met up with Steve, Tiago, and Tom. Came home at about 11:45 and woke up the next morning at 6:45 for a meet. Got there a little late, but it's all good. I did my full routine on the floor and didn't fall. Finished second in floor and vault, third on beam, with a 29.45 all-around score, which isn't bad since my meets improve as the season progresses."
10,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"Have you ever had one of those moments when you start reflecting on life? Like you're in math class, bored out of your mind, and you wonder how your brain comprehends math? Then you realize you're in math class and question why. Suddenly, you recognize how incredible existing is. Yet it hits you—going off on this random train of thought feels incredibly aimless. Has that happened to you? I can't stand it. You know what else bothers me? Block schedules. Who thought of that idea? Clearly, enduring a two-and-a-half-hour class in any subject is borderline cruel and unusual punishment."

Tonight, Andy beat me by a few small dollars and won the game—or maybe I let him win because he's leaving in a few hours, and I wanted him to feel good on his last night here. However the story goes, it can't compare to this Texas-sized headache I have at the moment. I've taken some Aleve, and I must say they're doing the trick. All I need now is some well-deserved rest and relaxation."
12,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"Today's been a long day; we drove home from Indiana. I'll need to be selective about what I write since I could easily go on for quite some time, and I don’t have enough energy. First of all, I must say that camp was incredible, even better than I had anticipated. God has been working in my life lately, and it's amazing. I feel like I've turned over a new leaf. Back to the beginning, we arrived at the Twiggs' house on Friday evening and stayed until we left for camp on Monday. We went to the fair, church, a parade, Walmart, and watched movies."
13,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"Today is the last day of my summer vacation, and I have a dentist appointment at 9. I hate that, but I'd rather get it over with than try to schedule it during the first month of my surgery rotation. I'm definitely nervous, scared, jittery, and any other words you can think of for not wanting to go back to school. This is going to be a whole new experience for me. As a perfectionist, I love excelling at everything I do, but starting new things is challenging. I hate being a pawn (like I told Cassie: 'I'm going to be the only pawn on the chessboard who insists on moving like a knight'), and I hate not knowing what's going on."
14,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"Arun Shourie discusses how the current Governor of Uttar Pradesh had forewarned, as early as 1996, about the looming threat of a ""third Islamic state"" emerging in the subcontinent. T.V. Rajeswar, the former head of the Intelligence Bureau and the present Governor of Uttar Pradesh, had forecasted this serious concern in a series of articles published in the Hindustan Times in 1996. Shourie raises a pertinent question when he asks, does discovering that Rajeswar, rather than himself or Mr. Advani, authored these warnings make them more credible? Or do you conclude that because Rajeswar sounded this alarm, he is a closet communalist who should not continue as Governor of Uttar Pradesh?"
15,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"Attitude: Bored; Mood: Indifferent. Looking forward to tonight—it's been a long, hard day in the trenches here, folks. Almost no time to write anything for you readers. However, it's good to see Tigger (now Akcron) taking up the reins herself, making an appearance, and discussing things. Not much to say about yesterday; it was Shakespeare on the Green—a lovely play. Unfortunately, I had to leave before the final curtain, which was disappointing. Hopefully, someday I'll see an entire Shakespeare play. But I digress. Akcron is right about the shower problems; it’s frustrating. The humor, though, in seeing someone struggling can be surprisingly entertaining."
16,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"Suddenly, over the past two days, I've been overwhelmed with intense exhaustion—utterly bone-tired. Last evening, I went home and immediately fell asleep, only waking when my mother called around eight-thirty. Upon waking, it was completely dark; I hadn't turned on the lights, so I couldn't tell the time or date for a few seconds. It was just my mother's voice in the darkness and me grappling with reality. I wonder why I'm feeling so drained. The weather is pleasant this morning; it was drizzling when I arrived. However, I've heard it’s been raining in Calcutta for the last three days."
17,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"Last night was the worst. I discarded the sweater I was knitting. I only had about 14 inches completed. I lost around $10 worth of yarn (it's $8 a skein). But I ended up with too many stitches by the time I reached the armholes, and the mohair was tangling, making frogging (ripping out rows) difficult. The yarn broke often. I didn't even swear, which is unusual for me. I just gloomily ripped and listened to season two of Sex and the City (thanks to the library!). Eventually, I got fed up and threw it away. I suppose I learned a lot while attempting to make this sweater."
18,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"Last night in class, we discussed that week's assigned reading, ""Getting Back into Place: Toward a Renewed Study of the Place-World"" by Edward S. Casey. The first chapter deals with “implacement,” while the second focuses on “displacement.” In the first chapter, Casey highlights that our contemporary world revolves around time as the central force: we feel we are running out of time, saving time, and being just in time. He argues that centering culture around place fosters a more grounded community. (This is a very rough summary—just a disclaimer in case my professor or classmates read this post.) So far, this book is the first reading to truly captivate me."
19,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"Whatever they put into freeze pops to achieve those vibrant colors should come with a warning: may cause unexpected adventures. And although laughing is healthy, it makes one wonder if we would have found ourselves climbing that fire escape to drink beer in the strong wind had we not indulged earlier. As we stood in a doorway of a bar sadly closed for business, we paused to sift through an office-supplies catalog that had arrived by mail. Fortunately, we did. Who would have imagined that within these pages were the deals of a lifetime? Certainly not I. Here are just a few: buy 36 permanent marker pens, receive a stunt kite; buy 30 lever arch files, receive a barbecue."
20,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"Currently listening to: ""The Little Drummer Boy"" by Stevan Pasero. And now my post... Senate Republicans, hands up—who watched the 39-hour judicial nominations marathon last week? I know I didn't. Well, okay—I did tune in once or twice. The entire colossal waste of time was orchestrated by Republicans, annoyed that Democrats wouldn't nominate four of Bush's controversial justices, who were trying to score political points by holding a multi-day event. Never mind the fact that Democrats have already approved 168 of Bush's judicial nominees—that's not good enough for the Republicans who seem to believe they have a huge mandate for this kind of behavior."
21,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"This was a good weekend. I enjoyed nature, listened to a lot of Nevermore (something I should have started doing much earlier), and read extensively. I finished three books: Bruce Sterling's ""Heavy Weather,"" Larry Niven's ""World of Ptavvs,"" and Octavia Butler's ""Parable of the Sower."" ""Heavy Weather"" was a good cyberpunk romp through a near-future USA, devastated by global warming and general anarchy. While it was clever, well-paced, and altogether convincing, I must confess that I failed to come away with any really significant impressions about the story or the characters. Not that both aren't well constructed and vividly etched—it's a good book, but not a great one, I guess."
22,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"After the first week back from practicum, overcoming the challenges was tough, but only in the second week has the fog truly begun to clear. Post-practicum trauma was an overlooked issue now gaining attention. I was affected, but meeting with the course coordinator allowed me to unburden myself, thus preventing another individual from being placed in a pedagogically deficient practicum school. Yesterday (Monday), I encountered a fellow classmate who was determined to warn the student assigned to her former school about its flaws. I calmed her down, suggesting that we approach the administrator first to address the concerns."

Rick, the Canadian, beats me regularly. We have a ping pong table in the front lobby of our building, so there's always time for a quick round. Last night, I participated in an 8-ball tournament at the hot spot, our recreation tent complete with a popcorn machine, numerous TVs, a jukebox, DVD rentals, a pool table, dartboard, and always the ping pong table. I was doing well in my one entire game until I scratched on the eight ball. I still had a good time, especially with the two Dutch soldiers joining the tournament."
24,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"In the fall of 1974, I was attempting, for what felt like the 13th time, to navigate the second chapter of my high school algebra book. I wasn’t then, nor am I now, a math person. Math has always been a challenge for me. You get the picture. As I struggled to make sense of algebra, the doorbell rang. I put down my book and opened the door; no one was there. Frustrated, I returned to my studies, just as a little glimmer of understanding emerged. The doorbell rang again, disrupting my breakthrough. Once more, no one was there—a perfect prank for a struggling math student."
25,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,blog,"This past week has been nothing short of exhausting. I spent Tuesday to Thursday finishing the move to my new classroom. The new room is bigger and closer to my grade-level team. These are important considerations as I spend hours preparing my room for this year. Had I known I was going to move prior to the end of the school year, I would have discarded many books and supplies I no longer use. Unfortunately, it all came with me. So, this week was spent moving, unpacking, and purging extensively. I have to thank my teammate Jill for helping with everything. She was still teaching this month, in my old room. She and her wonderful students moved almost my entire room for me!"

Even if I never carried your child, even if I was never married to you, even if I was never an official pair with you, I loved you immensely, and to this day, the feeling echoes through my heart. I will forever be reminded of those few nights we spent together, hearts and limbs entwined in a soul-embrace, drenched in the salty darkness of an evening by the beach, or a kiss under the rain. Whenever I feel a dark glass puncturing my heart, you will be there. That piece of you... bleeding the eternal love that once lived in me and still remains."

To rephrase, the article I'm working on and its consequences aren't something I'm entirely comfortable with. Perhaps it's because I don't fully believe in it, which prevents me from truly understanding its essence. The angst behind it. The full-on passion required to question. I grew up in a country where you don't ask questions. Really, you just don't. They punish you for that. They imprison you with internal security acts. I'm not used to this freedom of speech... not accustomed to questioning openly. Sure, I am not the easiest person to get along with."

We embarked on a 30-minute trek to the falls, leaving us breathless, but we persevered. The water was icy, and you could feel your body going numb from the chill. We stayed for less than an hour before heading to a nearby waterfall—another 30-minute trek. The trip was worth it, as the falls presented a calming and breathtaking scene. It felt as if you could hear yourself becoming one with nature. Soaking in the cold water was like communing with Mother Earth, as the cold air and water lulled us into serenity."

There's nothing better than seeing the excitement on your child's face. After the egg hunt, we all attended church.

Somehow, I managed to get a flat tire. Luckily, I'm at work, so the guys are going to inflate it for me and make sure it holds air. If not, they'll change the tire and put the spare on.

Parents often assume they know us so well, even thinking they can read our emotions. The truth is, they can't. Parents really don't understand us. For example, when I head upstairs after arguing with Nicole about Kelli, like I did a few minutes ago, they often ask what's wrong. Honestly, sometimes I wish they'd just leave it alone. I shouldn't have to explain everything to them. Here's the situation with Nicole and Kelli: they really don't get along. At all."

Basically, I'm just happy to be sitting here instead of still being stuck in my car.

The movie was great; I give it 4 1/2 stars because they left out some important details. Overall, the movie was good.

Meanwhile, a group of congressional Democrats, including four New Yorkers, has petitioned U.N.

Just before the new citizens departed the June 29 event, an immigration official overseeing the swearing-in encouraged them to visit a voter registration table—a common feature at naturalization ceremonies. However, this table was unusual: Republican volunteers were distributing forms, with the party affiliation box pre-checked to register all new voters as GOP members.

There's nothing like 48 hours of daydreaming to rejuvenate one's creative energy. For a foreigner, I have it good, and my timing was fortunate too. The illustration work is the icing on the cake. I’d probably complain more if this opportunity hadn’t fallen into my lap. I know I'm being taken advantage of, though; I'm not oblivious to that. Feeling hungry now.

As a non-American blogger, I've been somewhat hesitant to engage in some of these discussions, especially those involving flags. However, since I initiated it (the topic, not the flag-burning), I suppose it's important to comment. Firstly, I believe the idea of having a law against flag-burning is completely absurd. The moment you start granting a symbol—any symbol—that kind of automatic reverence and protection, you've taken a small yet significant step towards totalitarianism. Symbols are inherently fickle; they don't inherently represent anything. It's what they are perceived to mean or what they are made to represent that's important."

Re: Loss of Continuity in PX Day-Ahead Auction Due to ISO Rule Changes  

The emergency tariff filing by the California ISO last Friday has adversely affected the PX day-ahead auction market. The combination of soft and hard caps creates a disconnect and poses unacceptable risks to all participants and likely will not achieve the ISO's goal of reducing real-time energy sales and procurement. As a result, suppliers will continue to defer to the higher realized price opportunities offered by the ISO. The PX is petitioning Terry Winter of the ISO to promptly allow for adjustment bids on any submitted schedule at any price level."

In the event that Grays Harbor Paper experiences a unit derate or outage, RT should promptly notify BPA dispatch and adjust the schedule accordingly. For example, if the Grays unit trips at 13:33, RT is to inform BPA immediately. The schedule should then be reduced to zero by the top of the hour at 14:00.

I have nothing negative to say about this game as it has exceeded my expectations and will likely exceed yours too. The movement is fluid, it’s free of bugs and crashes, and there’s an abundance of story and content to engage with. You have daily options like multiple practices, events (sponsorships), and even games. This review is purely based on playing MyCareer, and so far, it's a 10/10. FaceScan worked really well for me.

97,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Magic fans beware... Wizards seems hesitant to create a decent digital game. At its core, Magic: The Gathering is a social game—a game to enjoy with friends or frenemies, sharing laughs, talking smack, and achieving game-winning moves. Wizards of the Coast appears to have forgotten this. If you choose to play with friends, you can't earn gold, which is crucial. Gold is so important that they've implemented a daily cap, understandable since it unlocks everything in the game. Instead, prepare for a long and dull 1v1 grind against the computer or random opponents, whom you can't even communicate with. If you choose to play for free, expect to spend roughly 4 hours a day, for at least a month, to unlock the cards."
98,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"As the third installment in the trilogy, I'll address the drawbacks first. I quite dislike prequels because they technically go backward in the story rather than forward, which is an issue for every prequel. However, they do offer more story development. The combat feels sloppy and lacks the sharpness that Arkham City achieved. As of writing this recommendation (26/10/2013), there is a game-breaking bug that prevents the completion of a side mission (the main story is not affected). Some gadgets are assigned to an inconvenient hotkey, requiring your hand to travel across the keyboard. It might seem minor, but during combat, it could potentially disrupt your combo."
99,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Shadow Warrior (2013) has been significantly improved. The boss fights are amazing, and the weapons feel impressive—perhaps not quite at the level of Doom 2016’s, but still robust. Enemies aren't overly tough if you manage elemental and upgrade features wisely. The upgrade system is well-balanced and becomes less tedious once you understand it. Elemental features and limited ammo encourage you to use different weapons. There are many unique, interesting weapons—unlike the procedurally generated ones in Borderlands—that remain useful throughout most of the game. The music is fantastic, particularly the main theme and Stan Bush’s contributions."
100,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"So many things were done wrong. I'm not even sure where to start this review. This all pertains to MyCareer. My player is an outside scorer, PG, 1.71m tall, with maxed stats and all necessary perks. Now, tell me, why does shooting skill depend on a person's height? Why can't someone who is 1.74m be as good at shooting as someone who is 1.71m? In real life, I'm 1.87m. I made my first player with this height and noticed I can't reach a skill higher than 89. Why? That's pure discrimination! And why doesn't the game inform me of this before I create a character or even when I reach the skill limit after weeks of playing?!"
101,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"In this installment of Assassin's Creed, the game truly excels in mechanics across all aspects, including ship battles, sailing, hunting, parkour, and more. I found myself more connected to the main character. Initially, the story begins roughly but improves significantly as the game progresses—something I've noticed with every AC game. Edward is a fascinating character, as are the side characters. The collectibles in this game felt meaningful, a sentiment I didn’t experience with previous entries. Perhaps it's because they seemed to have a more significant purpose in this game. While not required, they were fun to obtain, offering balanced rewards."
102,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"While I personally cannot recommend this game, it wasn't absolutely terrible. The gunplay is decent, provided you have the funds to purchase gun parts. This leads to my main complaint: it's pay-to-win. If I could overlook that, the game would be enjoyable. The hardsuit is fun to use, and HRV is an excellent concept. I'd choose this game over any Call of Duty title, but its pay-to-win microtransaction model is discouraging. If you don't mind this approach, then enjoy it. However, if you're like me and oppose pay-to-win schemes, let this one go; it's not our cup of tea."
103,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Although not flawless, this game has been highly enjoyable. The save system and the possibility of sudden death can be frustrating. During my first playthrough, I lost my main character around hour 10 out of approximately 20. I would have appreciated a save option to reload at that point. I've since used a third-party mod/save tool to prevent catastrophic failures. Additionally, the aiming reticle is small and the zoom is underpowered. Despite these issues, the game has been a blast. I'm not usually a zombie fan, but the blend of strategy, missions, and first-person shooter/beat-em-up elements is fantastic. I play it as often as possible, always telling myself—just one more mission, one more supply run—or escaping to safety before shutting the game down."
104,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"An absolutely great strategy game! Having played every single other wargame (European Escalation, and ALB), I have to say this one fits well. The number of units is impressive. Not sure exactly how many, but there’s a ton! The graphics are beautiful, the sounds are great, and the overall gameplay is epic. The in-game chat box at the main menu is very entertaining, no kidding. However, if you're new to the strategy genre, it could take time to master. Don’t get discouraged; you will lose units. Just plan ahead, and always have anti-air and anti-tank."
105,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"I was initially skeptical about this game before I played it. I wasn't even sure about buying it. The whole portal gun and portal concept seemed odd to me, even though I enjoy science fiction. Boy, was I wrong. The jokes and voice acting in this game are phenomenal. Simply amazing. It's not cheesy (well, occasionally), and each character has their own unique sense of humor and personality. The level design is superb. By the way, I never played the first Portal game. One of these days, I'm planning to, if I can spare the time. I would never have considered it if I hadn't played the sequel."
106,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Let's start with the pros (+) and cons (-), followed by my thoughts on this game. 

Pros: 
+ Some of the best characters 
+ Good story 
+ Loads of content 
+ Customizable character (you can be male or female, whatever you like) 
+ You can have a relationship with most of your companions (yes fangirls, you can have a love interest) 

Cons: 
- Poor graphics (I don't think graphics really matter anyway) 
- Awkward love scenes 
- Invisible walls 
- One mission was boring, in my opinion, but everyone has different tastes 

Neutral: 
+- The protagonist you create can't talk; whether that's good or bad depends on personal preference. 

My thoughts: I love this game. This is probably one of the best RPGs or games in general I've ever played. If you're an RPG fan, you probably already have this game."
107,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Yes, this is a nostalgic trip for thirty-somethings who remember watching the ever-irritating Timmy Mallett (at least in the UK) just for the five-minute Transformers cartoon. The voice actors for Optimus, Megatron, Bumblebee, and many others are back and instantly recognizable. The distinctive cartoon transformation sound is there. Graphically, the cel-shaded presentation is perfect and very, very Generation One. Aside from that, it's a very fun game. The combat mechanics are extremely well done. Transforming mid-fight is often necessary and seamlessly integrated into combos, making it quite different from High Moon's excellent War for/Fall of Cybertron games. There's a heavy focus on melee combat, but some enemies require a switch to a ranged blaster."
108,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"I downloaded the game and played it briefly, and it felt quite ordinary. I spent more time trying to log in than actually playing. There's a bug where, after an update to the terms of service appears and you click 'accept', the prompt just returns. You have to restart the client for it to function properly. While that's not too severe, why must I link my Steam and Gface accounts? They claim it's for DLC, but is that really necessary? It's irreversible, so now a company I don't care about has access to my Steam information. The game itself is average. It's clearly recognizable as a COD clone, but somehow, they've made the gunplay worse. How is that even possible?"

110,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"I experienced no performance issues even at release, and after all these patches, it plays exceptionally well. In my opinion, this is a truly great and fun game, although the format can be somewhat annoying, where the free-roam city area repopulates with new enemies every time you progress the story. I particularly enjoyed the 'dual play' segments, where you can play as Batman and another character. Using the controller for most parts of the game, and the mouse and keyboard for the tank combat segments was greatly appreciated. Driving the Batmobile around the free-roam city, especially when chasing the APC commanders, is quite enjoyable once you master skidding around corners."
111,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"This is an excellent FPS shooter—impressive in every way. It looks, sounds, and performs exceptionally well: engaging FPS mechanics, a compelling story, intriguing characters, flawless voice acting, and an outstanding soundtrack. It's not for the faint-hearted, though—some cutscenes are quite intense. When a game is this great overall, its flaws become more noticeable. Here's what stood out to me: - No SLI support, which was disappointing. I had to wait until I upgraded my card, as it struggled on my old dual GPU GTX 590. Ensure you have a decent single GPU card. - Annoyingly small obstacles are often unclimbable."

Graphics: The game is designed with a comic-like style. The graphics are very sleek with no unnecessary details and feature nice color schemes. It totally works for this game. The graphics can be set on 'high' without stressing your system. I run this game on an i5 Pentium processor with an NVIDIA GeForce 710M card, 8GB memory, and it runs like clockwork (Windows 8.1).

Controls: The game can be played with a keyboard and mouse or with an Xbox controller."
113,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"You can see by the hours I've put into this game that I enjoy it. This is everything I wished a search game from CoD would be. But don’t buy this game thinking it's like CoD, Battlefield, or any other shooter game. It's a game in its own class and should be treated as such. I can't tell you how many times I hear new players complain about getting killed really fast. Oh, heaven forbid you get shot in the face and die. It's not like that doesn’t happen in real life or anything. Edit: I've been playing this game for a while now. I've invested a lot in it. One of the best multiplayer games around. A good choice when you’re not in the mood for CS:GO."
114,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"I'm two hours in, and this game is hilarious. The gameplay is solid, the art design is beautiful, and the music is surprisingly high quality and fitting. The story and world have captured my interest, and the puzzles are enjoyable. The standout feature is the comedy. If you've played any RPG since the genre began, you'll appreciate the jokes, parodies, and references. Even if you're new to RPGs, you'll find the humor entertaining. If you've played Final Fantasy VII or X, this game is a must-play. Without giving too much away, I had to stop after two hours to rest my cheeks from all the laughter and smiles. What a delight!"
115,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"I'm really sorry. I try to be supportive of free-to-play games and indie developers, but I didn't enjoy this game. The description sounded appealing, but the execution didn't work for me. I love puzzle and exploration games, but I found this one completely unintuitive. Even after searching for guidance, I didn't find the gameplay fun. It also lacks a pause button, or if there is one, I couldn't find it. Considering that many sequences are timed, this seems like a critical oversight. Additionally, this game feels more like a series of cut scenes than gameplay, leaving me just sitting around, drumming my fingers."
116,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"This game... Phew, where to even start? It was absolutely beautiful. From the story to the graphics, I was hooked. The story wasn't just any story; it felt like I was the character, trying to figure out what came next. The gameplay was excellent, and I learned a lot about myself through this game (especially my fear of heights, which I discovered in the ice caverns). My gut churned the whole time, but I persevered for Uncle Fred! If you guys made a DLC or a sequel, I’d be the first to buy it and recommend it to everyone I know. Thanks to everyone involved in making this; you created an absolutely beautiful game."

Unlike previous games where you progressed through Earth's historical eras like the Stone Age, Medieval Age, and Modern Age, this game is set in the future, focused on colonizing a new planet. I appreciate that 2K took a fresh approach with new mechanics, such as the affinity system and orbital layer. However, these additions can sometimes make the game feel overwhelming. One area for improvement could be incorporating new artwork, particularly in the environments encountered during interactions with other leaders."
118,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Great game! Tons of replayability, and a very fun zombie survival experience! Definitely in my top 5 zombie games. Edit: after 60+ hours of playing, I can honestly say this is one of the better, more ""realistic"" zombie games. It's designed as a survival horror—you must conserve ammo, heal your wounds, and take pills if you're infected. I find the zombies well animated for a free-to-play game. P.S.: I recommend playing with 1 or 2 friends, but the community is super friendly, and you can usually make friends or chat with people through voice comms."
119,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"02/07/2014 - It's a shame I can't thoroughly recommend or enjoy this game. From the short time I've played it, I know I'd be addicted if it didn't have two major issues. No Australian servers - one red bar puts you at a severe disadvantage, creating unbearable lag. Mind you, I played through the offline training mode, and it was stuttering or lagging as well. How does that even happen? Coupled with the poor ping, it just ruins the game. Everything artifacts like crazy - the menus, backgrounds, training, and in-game. I've never had this happen before with this card and thought it might not like my overclocking. Set my GPU back to stock, and sure enough, it didn't make a difference."
120,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Late last night, I finished this. The story itself may not be very deep or captivating, but the storytelling truly stands out. The atmosphere is rich, and the numerous collectibles do an excellent job of fleshing it out. I learned a lot about the world of Batman, though I was somewhat disappointed by the limited number of bosses in the game. However, future games provide an opportunity to address this. The combat offers a suitable challenge, albeit leaning towards the easier side. Leveling up Batman was not particularly satisfying. The gadgets you upgrade and acquire during the campaign introduce enjoyable new gameplay mechanics. Gaining access to previously unreachable areas adds a pleasing sense of progression."
121,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"To the Moon"" is not just a game; it is a profound experience and one of the best of my life. Think Telltale's ""The Walking Dead"" is sad? It doesn't hold a candle to ""To the Moon""! Never have I been so profoundly moved by something fictional. This masterpiece epitomizes storytelling, and the soundtrack is a beautifully charming accompaniment. Yes, the controls can be a bit tricky, and gameplay isn't its strong suit, but the story is so exceptional that I didn't mind. Additionally, the humor is delightful and doesn't detract from the story's distinguished nature. Plus, the ""Doctor Who"" references are endless."
122,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Bastion is an outstanding game with an engaging storyline. Set in the aftermath of a calamity, you begin rebuilding on the bastion. The game offers numerous choices, including what structures to build for advantages, which weapons to use, and which power-ups and drinks provide bonus effects. The art style and music are superb, with vibrant visuals that defy the notion that the apocalypse must be dull. Most impressively, the game features narration that responds to your actions. For example, if you pick up a weapon and later swap it for another in the armory, the narration remarks on your choice of the new weapon."
123,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"I originally bought this game during its early development, back when the only currency was spacebux and there wasn't a ""tech tree."" At this stage, the game was great. All the guns were equally overpowerful, creating no imbalance; anyone could defeat anyone at any time. Back then, the game offered unlimited gun slots and five loadouts. You would expect that a game boasting ""bajillions of guns"" would provide more than six weapon slots and three loadouts without additional cost. At one time, I had about three pages' worth of guns and was brainstorming new ideas for more because, personally, that's where I found it entertaining."
124,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"This game was a surprising gem. Often, rave reviews can be misleading, but in this case, they genuinely reflect the enjoyment of this neat little game. It's an unusual blend of a classic 2D platformer and a MOBA, executed with style. I found myself enjoying characters that I wouldn't typically enjoy in other MOBA games. Despite my initial hesitations, I decided to try a melee tank. I was pleasantly surprised with the result and ended up trying more characters as they were unlocked through gameplay. The art style and interface are charming. Now, I use one of the characters as my avatar and a wallpaper from creating a card set for the game."
125,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"I just started playing, and I love this game. When I put on my headphones, I lose myself in the gameplay for hours. It's been a while since a game has captivated me like this. The music sets the perfect mood, the sound effects are spot on, and the controls are flawless. I eagerly anticipate each combat encounter, and they've optimized combat very well. I had doubts about the naval combat system, but it’s so exciting to defeat multiple fleets at once! The only way to lose is to fail to retreat. If combat looks overwhelming, just retreat, regroup, and counter-assault. Thanks to the developers for an amazing experience!"
126,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"The reboot of the Devil May Cry franchise has introduced many changes, particularly for the series’ protagonist, Dante. While fans of the original may be upset by the changes to their beloved character, it’s arguably for the better, as this new game by Ninja Theory demonstrates. DMC serves as the perfect entry point for newcomers. It explores the origins of an arrogant, cynical Dante and chronicles his transformation from cynicism to selflessness. The game weaves a clear narrative arc for this new Dante, making him a compelling character to follow. The story follows Dante as he is introduced to the corrupt world he once willfully ignored."
127,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Where do I begin with this absolutely beautiful game? Its story is utterly charming, filled with detail, happiness, bad puns, annoying dogs, and secrets. It balances seriousness with humor seamlessly. The character design is outstanding, featuring a variety of personalities and hidden depths. This game stands out from other RPGs because you don't have to kill anyone, an uncommon concept in the genre. Drawing inspiration from Earthbound, one of the best RPGs I've experienced, it’s evident this game is exceptional. Additionally, it boasts the best soundtrack I've heard in a long time."
128,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"I am recommending this solely because it's free and might offer a more enjoyable experience for others. As for my experience, the game did nothing for me. Half the story relies on shock factor. I was neither shocked nor emotionally moved in any way by this. Perhaps I'm desensitized, or maybe it was too simple to evoke a reaction from me. The other half of the game attempts to portray a person in mental decline, dealing with obsession, hallucination, and depression. In theory, it's a cool idea, but the game took me 10 minutes to complete, even with reading and absorbing every detail."
129,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Do I even need to explain why Portal is amazing? Portal is a puzzle game that presents you with a concept and then lets you explore it. It’s an excellent way to challenge your mind while still having fun. While the game isn't heavily focused on story, it did pave the way for one of the most popular games of 2011. I still play and complete it when I'm bored, and I love revisiting the game to see what laid the foundation for a legend. Gameplay: Portal's gameplay is quite simple to explain. You use portals to your advantage, combined with buttons that activate parts of the puzzle. There are two types of buttons: one you press and one that requires a cube."
130,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"If you're able to overlook the bugs (I personally encountered two: one minor and the other quite annoying—edit: both bugs are resolved), and are seeking a space exploration game, I can definitely recommend this. Since most reviews discuss specifications, I'll include mine: i5 6600k (~€200), Radeon RX480 (~€200), Z170 Pro - Gaming (~€150), 16GB DDR4 RAM (~€70). ~€650 is certainly within the medium price range, though this rig is quite new. It achieves almost constant 60+ fps on high settings with V-Sync enabled. I find it hard to believe that 90% of the comments claim to have an overkill setup and get only 20 fps."
131,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Remember Age of Mythology? It's been quite a while since we've seen an RTS game of such quality. Divinity: Dragon Commander comes remarkably close to my personal favorite RTS. It combines a grand strategy mode reminiscent of Risk, hitting the spot perfectly. I try not to be overly biased, even though this game allows you to transform into a dragon, supporting your troops by attacking and commanding unit production and direction simultaneously. Honestly, I appreciate complex RTS games today. Think of Civilization V, for instance. However, such games often cram intricate mechanics, charts, and resources into a single, complicated mode."
132,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Undertale comes together to create something greater than the sum of its parts. The graphics are solid for a retro title, and the music is beautiful; together, they create truly impactful moments. The script ranges from comedic to dramatic to heartbreaking to hopeful, sometimes all at once, while cleverly subverting RPG tropes.

If you enjoy video games, play this game. If you have seven free hours between now and your final breath, play this game."

The developers are very active in the community, as evident in various discussion forums and dev diaries. There is a steep learning curve to the game's mechanics, which I am still trying to master; however, this extensive strategy provides numerous ways to achieve goals and capitalize on situations. The game, in my opinion, is almost infinitely replayable. I find myself completely engaged in every session I play, regardless of how the playthrough is progressing."

However, the developers actively update the game with substantial content changes, new warframes, and other features. It's a good game for casual play, though it might only capture your interest for a few months unless you particularly enjoy grinding. The significant advantage is that the game is free, so I recommend giving it a try. If you're seeking a quick gaming fix, it's worth exploring."
136,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"This game is very boring. I purchased it thinking it was a PC version of 'Katamari Damacy,' a popular PS2 game. Sadly, it falls short. You go around absorbing increasingly larger objects to grow bigger, but the gameplay lacks smoothness, and the levels aren't inventive. Instead, it presents a surreal horror show—not the entertaining kind, but one that leaves you feeling depressed, questioning if life is what it ought to be. Every creature, from pets to humans, makes me wonder if the creators had an interest in taxidermy."
137,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Certainly, let me provide a polished version with the required changes:

Alright. Let me explain a few things. As someone deeply interested in politics, I was eager to try this game when I first heard about it. I thought, ""Oh, wow! A simulator of the road to becoming president! That sounds fun!"" Unfortunately, it wasn't. The game starts by asking you to pick a side: Republican or Democrat. There's no option for independent or third party. A bit disappointed but still optimistic, I continued to explore what I could do. I must give the game credit; the character customization, although limited, is quite enjoyable to experiment with. It's amusing that it's the only time it's an option to wear your head or not in a campaign."
138,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"The story of Fallout 3 was superior. Settlements interfere with the narrative to the point where you'll end up resenting managing them instead of engaging with the story. Some keys are hardcoded and can't be reassigned. The game is riddled with bugs. At one point, my Pip-Boy vanished permanently, and I had to research console commands to retrieve it. Power armor is essentially handed to you at the start, with power cores readily available in trader shops. This significantly devalues power armor compared to previous Fallout games. The story is mediocre, as is the game overall, but it doesn't crash every 10 minutes like Fallout 3. It is far more stable in comparison. Is it better than Fallout 3? No. Is it better than New Vegas? No. This title was overhyped given how disappointing it truly is."

Only less than 2.1% of players have achieved 13 out of 15 achievements!"
140,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Pros: + great graphics    
Cons: - bugs (especially environmental issues, such as getting stuck or your shots hitting an invisible wall despite having a clear line of sight to the enemy)  
- the game feels like it is handholding or babysitting you  
- poor AI  
- enemies always seem to know your location once spotted  
- the enemy's accuracy is frustratingly high, similar to the first Ghost Warrior  
- terrible checkpoints and save options  
- uninteresting story that was hard to engage with  
I wouldn't recommend this game unless it's heavily discounted, even then, I find playing it a tedious chore. Finishing it just feels like a task to move on to the next game in my library. Given my experience with the first Ghost Warrior, I likely won't finish this one."

The learning curve and the time required to do anything interesting at the outset were both too steep for me. Perhaps if I were more patient and had more time for gaming, I would find it compelling. However, I lack both, and there are many other VR games I'd prefer to spend my time on."
144,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,game_review,"Hands down, this is my favorite first-person shooter of all time. Run-and-gun players need not apply. The recoil and ballistics are realistic. Single hits to the chest, neck, or head from rifle-caliber weapons nearly always result in death unless they graze you. Rounds drop over distance, and short, controlled bursts are necessary to stay on target. There is no magical ammunition pool; if you reload halfway through your magazine frequently, you'll end up with a pouch full of half-full mags. You can't run indefinitely; sprinting too long affects your aim as you gasp heavily until you catch your breath. Rest your weapon on your elbows while prone or on a window sill to steady your aim. Standing accuracy suffers."

I loved that game; it was unforgiving in the early stages but rewarding when you succeeded. As for XCOM 2, I love it. The game plays well for me on medium settings, and I am using a GTX 560 with 2GB of VRAM. Initially, the game was set to high, and it ran a bit sluggishly, but not to the point of being unplayable. When I lowered it to medium, it smoothed out. I'm not sure if I'm simply lucky regarding game issues, but most negative reviews seem to come from some very entitled individuals."

Fiat and General Motors (GM) must reach an agreement by midnight on 1 February to resolve their disagreement over a potential takeover. At this deadline, Fiat gains the right to sell its car division to GM, as outlined in the alliance formed in 2000. GM, which is facing losses in its European operations, no longer wishes to own the unprofitable Fiat unit. Reports of stalled negotiations caused Fiat shares to drop 1.2% on Tuesday, following a 4% rise on Monday due to hopes of a resolution. It is believed the U.S. firm is offering approximately $2 billion (£1.06 billion) to end the agreement. GM contends the deal was nullified by Fiat's decision to sell off its finance arm and reduce GM's stake through a capital-raising initiative.

A group of MPs has sought to increase pressure on Tony Blair regarding reform of the House of Lords by unveiling a detailed plan for change. This cross-party group has introduced a draft bill that suggests a smaller second chamber with 70% of its members elected. Since 1999, MPs and peers have struggled to reach an agreement on reform, particularly after 600 hereditary peers lost their seats. The group believes it can garner support to remove the last 92 hereditary peers. The government postponed plans to remove the remaining hereditary peers, citing opposition in the Lords. Tony Blair has emphasized the need for consensus on reforms, and there have been indications that Labour's manifesto will propose changes, at least to the powers of the Lords."

Rather than detecting the voltage drop caused by radiation, the proposed system measures pulse width—the time required for the voltage to revert to its baseline. This eliminates the need for power-intensive and large analog-to-digital converters. A prototype ASIC is developed using the TSMC 65 nm LP CMOS process, consuming an average static power of 0.535 mW under a 1.2 V analog and digital power supply.

Additionally, most existing detection tools prioritize accuracy, which does not necessarily align with maintaining the credibility of product reviews. To tackle these challenges, we propose a minimax game in which spammers and detectors compete based on their practical goals, beyond just detection accuracy. The Nash equilibria of this game result in stable detectors that are resilient to a range of mixed detection strategies."

Our findings are applicable when the true mixture components meet a specific separation condition, remaining valid even with over-or under-specified component numbers. For Gaussian mixtures with three components, we achieve sharper results concerning the scaling with component separation."

For $n$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-like states, the most robust witness scheme requires $n+1$ local measurement settings and can tolerate up to $1/2$ white noise.

These geometries can disrupt the axial and equatorial symmetry of the Kerr metric, resulting in a more complex multipolar structure, offering a pathway to phenomenologically constrain fuzzball models. We provide numerical evidence indicating that all multipole moments tend to be larger (in absolute value) than those of a Kerr black hole with the same mass and spin.

This note indicates that, within a generic Einstein quantum theory of gravity in AdS, exact stability of extremal black branes conflicts with rigorously proven quantum information theorems concerning entanglement entropy.

224,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,paper_abstract,"Following the suggestion from the Monte Carlo experiments in Jiménez (J. of Turbul. 2020), which highlight that dipoles are as crucial to the dynamics of decaying two-dimensional turbulence as individual vortex cores, it has been found that the kinetic energy of this flow is carried by elongated streams formed by the concatenation of dipoles. Vortices separate into a family of small, fast-moving cores and another family of larger, slowly moving ones, which can be described as 'frozen' into a slowly evolving 'crystal'. The kinematics of both families differ significantly, with only the former being self-similar. The latter accounts for most of the kinetic energy of the flow, as its vortices form the dipoles and streams. Mechanisms for the growth of this slow component are discussed."
225,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,paper_abstract,"Continuous-time quantum walks have proven to be an invaluable framework for designing various quantum algorithms. Typically, the running time of these quantum algorithms is characterized by the quantum hitting time: the duration required by the quantum walk to locate a vertex of interest with high probability. This article presents enhanced upper bounds for the quantum hitting time, applicable to multiple CTQW-based quantum algorithms. Specifically, we apply our methods to the glued-trees problem, improving the hitting time upper bound by a polynomial factor from $o(n^5)$ to $o(n^2\log n)$. Moreover, our approaches significantly improve the precision dependence of the continuous-time quantum walk-based algorithm to identify a marked node on any ergodic, reversible Markov chain, as demonstrated by Chakraborty et al."
226,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,paper_abstract,"Extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) can be classified as dry EMRIs and wet EMRIs based on their formation mechanisms. Dry, or ""loss-cone,"" EMRIs, previously considered the main sources for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, are primarily produced by multi-body scattering in nuclear star clusters and gravitational capture. Here, we highlight an alternative formation channel: wet EMRI formation assisted by accretion flow around accreting galactic-center massive black holes (MBHs). In this channel, the accretion disk captures stellar-mass black holes initially on inclined orbits and drives them to migrate towards the MBH. This process significantly boosts the formation rate of EMRIs in such galaxies."

Despite this, we aim for our recommender systems to captivate users at first sight, encouraging them to remain on the website and become active participants. This challenge, known as the new user cold-start problem, is vital for a company's growth and even its survival. Existing solutions for user cold-start recommendations either demand additional user involvement, such as an interview process, or rely on supplementary information like user demographics, locations, or social relationships. However, users may be reluctant to participate in interviews, and such side information is often unavailable for cold-start users."
228,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,paper_abstract,"Deep learning has resolved numerous issues beyond the capabilities of heuristic algorithms. It has been successfully applied in wireless communications, despite current radio systems being well-understood with optimal algorithms for many tasks. Although gains have been achieved by learning individual receiver components, a better strategy involves jointly learning the entire receiver. This often leads to a challenging nonlinear problem, making the optimal solution difficult to implement. To address this, we propose a deep fully convolutional neural network, Deeprx, which executes the entire receiver pipeline from frequency domain signal stream to uncoded bits in a 5G-compliant manner. We ensure accurate channel estimation by carefully constructing the convolutional neural network's input, utilizing both data and pilot symbols."
229,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,paper_abstract,"Mutation-based fuzzing typically employs a set of non-crashing seed inputs (a corpus) to generate new inputs by mutation. Often, a corpus includes thousands of similar inputs, resulting in a lack of diversity that can lead to inefficient fuzzing efforts due to exhaustive mutations from all available seeds. To tackle this, fuzzers offer distillation tools (e.g., afl-cmin) that select the smallest subset of seeds triggering the same range of instrumentation data points as the complete corpus. Common practice indicates that minimizing the number and cumulative size of the seeds enhances fuzzing efficiency, which we systematically explore. We present the results from over 34 cpu-years of fuzzing using five distillation approaches to understand their impact on discovering bugs in real-world software."
230,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,paper_abstract,"In this paper, we investigate multi-agent discrete-event systems with partial observation. The agents can be divided into distinct groups, each of which possesses similar (isomorphic) state transition structures. As such, they can be relabeled into a common template. Based on this template, we design a scalable supervisor whose state size and computational cost remain independent of the number of agents, even under partial observation. This scalable supervisor does not require recomputation, regardless of changes in the number of agents within the system. We extend our earlier results to partial observation by proposing sufficient conditions for safety and maximal permissiveness of the scalable least restrictive supervisor at the template level. An example is provided to illustrate the proposed scalable supervisory synthesis."

An efficient approach for ENF estimation is introduced using temporal windowing, based on the filter-bank Capon spectral estimator. The method uses a Gohberg-Semencul factorization of the model covariance matrix due to the Toeplitz structure. Notably, it employs a temporal window, not necessarily rectangular, before spectral estimation, marking a first in ENF. Krylov matrices enable fast matrix inversions. This method surpasses state-of-the-art ENF estimation techniques, especially with a short time window of 1 second in power recordings. In speech recordings, it delivers highly accurate results in terms of time complexity and accuracy."

Additionally, it offers regularized regression estimators utilizing these reduced dimensions, from classical principal component regression to sparse partial robust m-regression. The package includes both classical and robust pre-processing tools, such as generalized spatial signs, along with specialized plotting and cross-validation features.

233,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,paper_abstract,"Nonlinear fluorescence emission is widely used for high spatial resolution optical imaging. We examined the fluorescence anomalous saturating effect of the nitrogen vacancy defect in diamond, where fluorescence reduction occurs with high-power laser excitation. This increases fluorescence emission nonlinearity and alters the spatial frequency distribution of the image. Employing a differential excitation protocol, we extracted high spatial frequency information. By modulating the laser power, the spatial resolution improved approximately 1.6 times compared to confocal microscopy. Owing to the simplicity of the experimental setup and data processing, we anticipate this method can enhance spatial resolution in sensing and biological labeling using defects in solids."
234,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,paper_abstract,"When random effects correlate with sample design variables, using individual survey weights (constructed to be inversely proportional to the unit survey inclusion probabilities) in forming a pseudo-likelihood fails to deliver asymptotically unbiased inference. To address this, we develop a weight-exponentiated formulation for the random effects distribution to achieve unbiased inference when generating hyperparameters of the random effects. Our approach contrasts with frequentist methods that depend on numerical integration, showing that only the Bayesian method offers unbiased estimation regarding the sampling design distribution and consistency with the population generating distribution. Our simulations and real data example, based on a survey of business establishments, highlight the effectiveness of our method across diverse modeling formulations and sampling designs. This work concludes recent developmental efforts that integrate traditional survey estimation strategies with the Bayesian modeling approach, providing a bridge between these two rich, yet distinct, sub-fields."

These materials’ reduced symmetries lead to inhomogeneous electron, optical, valley, and spin responses, alongside novel properties such as ferroelasticity, ferroelectricity, magnetism, spin-wave phenomena, significant nonlinear optical properties, photogalvanic effects, and superconductivity.

For the first time, it was discovered that in a mesogenic polymer, unlike low-molecular-weight mesogens, the relaxation of the electric birefringence of a melt above the nematic-isotropic phase transition temperature can be described as a combination of several exponential processes, two of which are crucial. These primary processes succeed each other over a temperature range of about fifty degrees. Dielectric spectroscopy also allowed differentiation of two orientational relaxation processes: the first is due to the rotation of the side mesogenic groups, and the second is related to the motion of the main chain segments."

The optimization of discrete hash bits remains a core focus in these methods. Typically, an activation function like $\operatorname{sigmoid}(\cdot)$ or $\operatorname{tanh}(\cdot)$ is used, with a quantization loss minimized to approximate discrete values. However, this approach can lead to hash bits becoming trapped in the saturated regions of the activation functions, a phenomenon we term the ""dead bits problem (DBP)."" Furthermore, traditional quantization loss can exacerbate DBP. In response, we introduce a straightforward yet effective gradient amplifier that operates prior to the activation functions to mitigate DBP."

The stable case faces constraints from disappearing charged track searches at the LHC and dark matter direct detection experiments, while the decaying triplets are limited by existing multilepton collider searches. A two-step electroweak phase transition with a stable triplet and negative quadratic term is ruled out by direct detection, while an unstable triplet with a mass under $230\ \mathrm{GeV}$ is excluded at $95\%$ confidence level."

This scenario proposes an initially circular and narrow belt of planetesimals at semi-major axis $a$, which gains eccentricity $e_f$ after the gas disc disperses due to secular perturbations from an eccentric planet, forming a belt of width $2ae_f$. However, narrower belts might occur if the planetesimals start with eccentricity, possibly due to earlier planet perturbations during the gas-rich protoplanetary disc phase. Alternatively, primordial eccentricity might result from instabilities that increase disc eccentricity without planet involvement."

In one dimension (1D), the physics of interacting electrons is effectively described at low energies by the Tomonaga-Luttinger-Liquid (TLL) model. However, experimental observations beyond this linear regime are limited. We present measurements of many-body modes in 1D gated-wires using a tunneling spectroscopy technique. We identify two distinct Fermi seas at high energies, linked to spin and charge excitations, along with the emergence of three additional 1D 'replica' modes that intensify as the wire length decreases. The effective interaction strength in the wires is varied by altering the extent of 1D inter-subband screening by over 45%."

To constrain this formation path, we explore the link between the globular clusters and the known merging events the Milky Way has experienced. To this end, we combined the kinematic information provided by Gaia for almost all galactic clusters with the largest sample of cluster ages available, after carefully correcting for systematic errors. To identify clusters with a common origin, we analyzed their dynamical properties, particularly in the space of integrals of motion. We find that about 40% of the clusters likely formed in situ."

In this paper, we uncover a surprising result of popularity-based rankings: the fewer items that report a given signal, the higher the share of overall traffic they collectively attract. This ""few-get-richer"" effect occurs in contexts with few distinct item classes (e.g., left-leaning versus right-leaning news sources) and where items are ranked by popularity. We analytically show that this effect arises when people predominantly click on top-ranked items and exhibit diverse preferences for item classes. Through simulations, we assess how the effect’s strength varies with different assumptions about the environment and human behavior. We further test our predictions in an online experiment with human participants. Our findings hold significant implications for understanding the spread of misinformation."

To address this issue, we introduce a new sparsity dimension, called pattern-based sparsity, which includes pattern and connectivity sparsity, achieving both high accuracy and hardware efficiency. With meticulously designed patterns, our proposed pruning consistently enhances accuracy and improves feature extraction across different DNN structures and datasets. Our pattern-aware pruning framework also includes pattern library extraction, pattern selection, pruning, and weight training simultaneously. Our approach to pattern-based sparsity naturally integrates into compiler optimization for efficient DNN execution on mobile platforms."

Your influence and ideas can help accelerate momentum for a carbon-neutral world by 2050. That is the only way to avert the worst impacts of global heating. We have the tools, the science, and the resources. Let us now enter this race with political will and energy."
272,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"Menstruation—a simple word describing a natural biological process—has been weighed down by centuries of stigma, transforming it into a topic most of us only speak about in whispers. But why? As I speak to you now, more than 800 million women worldwide are experiencing their period. None of us would exist without it, yet it remains an ""embarrassing"" subject. From my experience and that of the women around me, I can tell you it's exhausting. It's exhausting to discreetly take out a pad, hide it in your pocket during class, and rush to the washroom. It's exhausting to sit through lessons and meetings, pretending to be normal while suffering intense cramps."
273,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"The world's largest and most devastating environmental and industrial project is situated in the heart of Canada's boreal forest, the largest and most intact forest in the world. It spans across northern Canada, including Labrador, where it hosts the largest remaining wild caribou herd: the George River caribou herd, numbering around 400,000 animals. Unfortunately, during my visit, I couldn't spot any, but antlers serve as proof. The boreal forest is blessed with an incredible abundance of wetlands, which are globally one of the most endangered ecosystems. These critical ecosystems clean air and water, sequester large amounts of greenhouse gases, and are home to a vast diversity of species."
274,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"Before the world of humans began, there was the realm of the gods, consisting of fields, plains, and gardens. Four brothers roamed this celestial domain. They had no family except each other and didn’t even know their parents. One of the brothers, Deminan, looked different. His skin was covered with painful scabs, and he wondered why he alone had this affliction. One day, when the supreme spirit Yaya was out in his gardens, Deminan and his brothers snuck into Yaya’s house. After feasting and exploring, they noticed a giant gourd hanging in the corner. While trying to look inside the gourd, they accidentally dropped it."
275,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"I graduated seven years ago from Berkeley with a dual degree in Molecular and Cell Biology and Linguistics. I attended a career fair on campus, where I secured an interview with a start-up called Theranos. At that time, there wasn't much information available about the company, but what little there was seemed impressive. Essentially, the company aimed to create a medical device that would allow you to run your entire blood panel with just a finger-stick of blood. This technology was intriguing not only because it was less painful than traditional blood tests, but also because it had the potential to revolutionize predictive diagnostics."
276,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"My journey to becoming a polar specialist, focusing on photography in the polar regions, began when I was four. My family moved from southern Canada to northern Baffin Island, near Greenland. We lived in a tiny Inuit community of 200 people, one of only three non-Inuit families there. Without a television, computers, or even a radio, and no telephone, I spent all my time outside with the Inuit, playing. The snow and ice were my sandbox, and the Inuit were my teachers. It was there that I developed a deep fascination with the polar realm."
277,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"We are perceived as the organization that catches those affected by failed social policies. I can't determine who comes to us or how long they stay. We receive individuals for whom nothing else has worked, those who have slipped through all other social safety nets. Others cannot contain them, so we must. That is our role: to contain and control them. Over the years, as a prison system, as a nation, and as a society, we've excelled at this, but it shouldn't be a point of pride. Today, we incarcerate more people per capita than any other country globally. We have more Black men in prison today than were enslaved in 1850."
278,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"I'd like to invite you on the epic quest of the Rosetta spacecraft. To escort and land the probe on a comet has been my passion for the past two years. To accomplish this, I need to explain something about the origin of the solar system. Four and a half billion years ago, there was a cloud of gas and dust, where our sun eventually formed and ignited. Along with it, planets, comets, and asteroids came into existence. According to theory, after Earth cooled down, comets massively impacted it, delivering water and possibly complex organic material. This may have initiated the emergence of life on Earth."
279,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"Chris Anderson: Hello, TED community, welcome back for another live conversation. It's a significant one today, as important as they come. When we created this ""Build Back Better"" series, our thought was how we could address issues arising from the pandemic and imagine how to rebuild from that. However, the events of this past week, particularly the horrific death of George Floyd and the ensuing daily protests, have given this moment new urgency, which we must address. Can we build back better from this? I believe before we begin to answer that question, we must seek to understand the magnitude of this moment. Whitney Pennington Rodgers: That's right, Chris."
280,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"In 1903, the President of the United States embarked on a three-day camping trip in California's Yosemite Valley. President Theodore Roosevelt slept among a grove of towering sequoia trees, camped during a snowstorm, and spent hours in conversation around the campfire with his host and guide, conservationist John Muir. Roosevelt famously cherished the outdoors, but Muir's invitation had a purpose beyond leisure: Yosemite was under threat. Although it became protected land in 1864, the valley faced potential overdevelopment in 1903. It lay at the center of a long-standing struggle to designate land for both preservation and public enjoyment—two objectives easier in theory than practice. The conflict over Yosemite began with the 1849 Gold Rush, as miners surged westward in search of riches in the Sierra Nevada foothills."
281,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"Hello. This is my first trip, my first time outside the walls of Gaza. I'm so happy to be here. (applause) My dream was always to be a pilot, to fly a plane, to feel freedom in the sky, to touch the sky. But that didn’t happen. Simply put, I live in Gaza, and there is no airport. All borders are closed on every side. We live in one of the largest prisons in the world. The only thing I can do is gaze upward. On some days, we're lucky to have electricity for four or five hours. When it’s cold, we make a fire outside or on the roof."
282,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"I'm sorry I cannot show you my face because, if I do, the bad guys will come for me. My journey started 14 years ago. I was a young reporter, having just graduated from college. Then I got a scoop—a simple story. Police officers were taking bribes from hawkers on the streets. As a young reporter, I aimed to report it uniquely for maximum impact, since everyone knew it was happening, yet nothing was being done. So I decided to act as a seller. By doing so, I documented hardcore evidence. The impact was significant; it was fantastic. This approach is known as immersion journalism or undercover journalism."
283,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"One simple vitamin can reduce your risk of heart disease. Eating chocolate reduces stress in students. A new drug prolongs the lives of patients with a rare disease. Health headlines like these are published every day, often making opposite claims. There can be a disconnect between broad, attention-grabbing headlines and the specific, incremental results of the medical research they cover. How can you avoid being misled by such headlines? The best way to assess a headline’s credibility is to examine the original research it reports. We've created a hypothetical research scenario for each of these headlines. Keep watching for the explanation of the first example; then, pause at the headline to consider the question. These are simplified scenarios."
284,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"When I was 14, my family was in the process of adopting my younger brothers from Ethiopia. One day, my mom asked, ""What day should we choose for their birthday?"" I replied, ""The day they were born, obviously!"" I thought it was a ridiculous question. Then my mom explained, ""Kristen, neither of your brothers has a birth certificate. How can we find out when that was?"" My mind was blown. Now, 20 years later, I’m still working on it. Instead of just solving my brothers' missing birth certificates, I tackle this issue globally. So, what do birth certificates have to do with international development?"
285,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"Imagine if you could connect your brain to a machine that would provide ultimate pleasure for the rest of your life. If given the option to choose such an existence, would you take it? This is the question posed by philosopher Robert Nozick in his thought experiment called the Experience Machine. The experiment invites us to consider a world where scientists have created a machine that simulates real life, ensuring experiences of only pleasure and no pain. The catch? You must permanently leave reality behind, though you'll barely notice the difference. Your experiences will be indistinguishable from reality, with life's natural ups and downs replaced by an endless series of highs. Tempting, isn't it?"
286,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"I'd like to share the most embarrassing incident from my career as a palliative care physician. It occurred a few years ago when I was consulted to see a woman in her 70s—a retired English professor with pancreatic cancer. My consultation was requested due to her pain, nausea, and vomiting. During our discussion about her symptoms, she inquired if medical marijuana might alleviate her condition. Reflecting on my medical school education regarding medical marijuana was brief because I realized I had learned absolutely nothing."
287,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"For the past 24 years, I have been a firefighter in Huntington, West Virginia. As firefighters, my team and I are dedicated to saving lives and property from disasters such as car accidents, house fires, and life-threatening medical emergencies. I am a woman leading a department in a male-dominated field. Ten years ago, I chose to expand my medical expertise by earning a nursing degree. This decision was driven by the realization that the next significant threat facing not just my city but others nationwide wasn't a singular disaster where firefighters arrive, extinguish the fire, and depart, assured that everything is resolved."
288,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"Where does all the carbon we release go? Carbon participates in a natural cycle, present in living things, soil, oceans, the atmosphere, and deep underground rocks. When organisms die, much of their stored carbon eventually returns to the atmosphere until new plants grow and reabsorb it. Over millions of years, some carbon from ancient trees and sea life becomes rock, while some becomes fossil fuels: coal, oil, and natural gas. Natural events like volcanic eruptions release some of the carbon trapped in rocks. Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, also release this prehistoric carbon. Today, humans emit around 60 times more carbon than all the planet's volcanoes combined each year."
289,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"Even nature's most unappealing creatures possess important secrets, but who would welcome a swarm of cockroaches approaching them? One of the key differences between natural and human technologies is robustness. Robust systems remain stable in complex and unfamiliar environments. Remarkably, cockroaches can self-stabilize while running over rough terrain. When we attached a jet pack to them or exposed them to disturbances like an earthquake, we found their finely tuned legs enabled them to self-stabilize without engaging their brainpower. They can move over complex terrains such as grass with ease, remaining undisturbed. We discovered a behavior where, due to their shape, they automatically roll to their side to navigate this artificial test bit of grass. Robust systems can perform multiple tasks with the same structure."
290,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"These are challenging economic times, fellow TEDsters, challenging times indeed. However, I wish to uplift your spirits with one of the significant, yet mostly unrecognized, commercial success stories of the last two decades. This story is comparable, in its unique way, to the accomplishments of Microsoft or Google. It is an industry that has defied the current recession with resilience: organized crime. Now, organized crime has existed for a very long time, you might say, and indeed, these words hold wisdom. Yet, in the past 20 years, it has experienced remarkable expansion, accounting for around 15 percent of the world's GDP. I like to call it the global shadow economy, or McMafia, for short. So, what triggered this extraordinary growth in cross-border crime?"
291,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"If you ask people which part of psychology they find difficult and mention ""thinking and emotions,"" most will say, ""Emotions are terribly hard. They're incredibly complex, and I have no idea how they work. But thinking is straightforward: it's just some form of logical reasoning."" However, that's not the real challenge. Here's a list of issues that arise. A notable problem is, what do we do about health? Recently, I read something suggesting that handshaking is probably the largest single cause of disease in the West."
292,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"What is a parent? It's not an easy question. Today, with adoption, stepfamilies, and surrogate mothers, many parents face complex decisions. Should we tell our child about the sperm donation? If so, when and how? Sperm donors are often called ""biological fathers,"" but should we use the word ""father""? As a philosopher and social scientist, I have studied these questions about the concept of parenthood. But today, I will share insights from speaking with parents and children. They understand what truly matters within a family, even if their family looks a little different."
293,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"When I look in the mirror today, I see a justice and education scholar at Columbia University, a youth mentor, an activist, and a future New York State senator. I see all of that and a man who spent a quarter of his life in state prison—six years, to be exact, starting as a teenager on Rikers Island for an act that nearly cost a man his life. But what got me from there to here wasn't the punishment I faced as a teenager in adult prison or the harshness of our legal system. Instead, it was a learning environment that introduced me to something I didn't think was possible for me. A few weeks before my release on parole, a counselor encouraged me to enroll in a new college course being offered in the prison."
294,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"What do you see when you look at me? A woman of faith, an expert, or maybe a sister? Or perhaps you see someone who is oppressed, brainwashed, even a terrorist. Or just an airport security delay, which is actually true. (laughter) If some of your perceptions were negative, I can't really blame you. That's how the media often portrays people who look like me. One study found that 80 percent of news coverage about Islam and Muslims is negative. Research shows many Americans say they don't know a Muslim. I guess people don't talk to their Uber drivers. (laughter) Well, for those of you who have never met a Muslim, it's nice to meet you."
295,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"We need to build a weather service for water. Yet, until we collectively demand accountability, the incentives to fund it will not exist. The first time I spoke at a conference was here at TED, eight years ago. Fresh out of grad school, little did I know that in those few minutes on stage, I was framing the questions I would be asked for the next decade. Like many 20-somethings, I expected to solve the world's problems—specifically, the water issues—with my technology. I had a lot to learn. It was seductive, believing that our biggest water quality problems persist because they’re hard to identify. I presumed we just needed simpler, faster, and more affordable sensors. I was wrong."
296,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"For 20 years, I worked in finance and understood it thoroughly. The global economy was my world. Topics like ecology and the end of the world, which I knew extensively, didn't seem credible to me. In 2007, however, an unprecedented event occurred—the subprime crisis and the collapse of major American banks. It was a wake-up call. I had numerous intense discussions with my wife about the situation and my career, questioning the limits of the model. Beyond the crisis, I realized my assumptions were wrong and that we were headed for disaster."
297,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"So, I'll be speaking to you using language because I can. This is one of these magical abilities that we humans have. We can transmit really complicated thoughts to one another. What I'm doing right now is making sounds with my mouth as I exhale. I'm producing tones, hisses, and puffs, creating vibrations in the air. These vibrations travel to you, hitting your eardrums. Then your brain transforms these vibrations into thoughts. I hope that's happening. Because of this, we humans can transmit our ideas across vast reaches of space and time. We're able to share knowledge across minds."
299,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"Baking apple pie? Discount Orange Warehouse has you covered! A fruit's a fruit, right? It's 1988, and scientist James Hansen has just testified to the United States Congress that global warming trends are caused by human activity and will pose an increasing threat to humanity in the future. That’s unusually prescient for a human. Looking for a wedding dress? Try a new take on a timeless classic. It’s sleek, flattering, and modest—just like the traditional dress. Commercials. Could anything be more insufferable? It’s 1997, and the United States Senate has called a hearing about global warming. Some expert witnesses noted that past periods in Earth’s history were warmer than the 20th century."
300,hybrid,none,none,polish_75,speech,"Someone once said that politics is ""showbiz for ugly people."" On that basis, I feel like I've truly arrived. Another thing to consider is the honor it is, as a politician, to give a TED Talk, especially here in the U.K., where the reputation of politics has suffered due to the expenses scandal. There was even a story recently about scientists considering replacing rats in experiments with politicians. When asked why, they said, ""There's no shortage of politicians, no one really minds what happens to them, and, after all, there are some things rats just won't do."" (Laughter) I know you all love data, so I'm starting with a data-rich slide."
