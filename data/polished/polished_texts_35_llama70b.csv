1,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Another week just flew by. I drove by the new house yesterday and noticed the front window was covered in boxes. We may receive the keys at closing, and I'm getting increasingly excited. If all goes well this week, we will be set for closing a week from Wednesday. I was up until after 3:00am last night watching movies with Bethany. There has been a lot of movie watching going on around here lately. Here's my rundown: last night we watched Thirteen, a movie every mother of a teen should see. It exceeded my expectations. Then we watched Gigli, and it was just as disappointing as the media said it was, but we had to see for ourselves."
2,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Summer TV used to be a dead zone filled with repeats, but now there are two great new shows on TV that I've been watching religiously for the last week. One of them is ""Blow Out,"" a show with a concept that seems to have zero gay people in sight, despite its title. The show revolves around hairstylist Jonathan Antin, who wants to build a second location for his popular West Hollywood salon, this time in Beverly Hills. Normally, I wouldn't care, but as I was flipping through the channels, I caught a glimpse of Jonathan, who appears equally narcissistic and dull, standing in an empty space on Rodeo Drive, proclaiming in a public voice, ""I'm going to build the greatest salon in the history of the world ever!"" I was hooked. Not since ""Rocco"" have I found such a moron so compelling to watch."
3,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"What a week... I've developed tendonitis in my right shoulder, just under my shoulder blade. When I move my arm excessively, particularly when using a computer mouse, it's excruciating. I've had to limit my movement due to a recent website update and other online tasks. I'm struggling to muster the strength to draw anything. Lack of sleep is exacerbating the pain. I'm not too happy right now, but I'll recover. On a positive note, my mom's surgery went well. Her eyesight has partially returned, allowing her to see fuzzy shapes and distinguish colors. Although she's still largely blind, hopefully, she'll fully regain her vision soon."
4,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Kindness of strangers... I attempted laundry today with the kids in tow and realized how quickly the simplest tasks can become a chaotic ordeal. I also learned how remarkably kind total strangers can be, simply because they feel like being sweet. Trust me, it wasn't like they had ulterior motives. I had kid drool all over me and was wearing my casual 'wash-day' outfit... Also, I'm not sure I'll ever be bathing again, so there wasn't even an olfactory incentive. Currently, I'm multitasking - composing this post and watching the collected No Doubt videos, both from the comfort of my desk in my room."
5,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"It's 11:14pm MST, and I'm sitting in my bedroom, fixing the personal computer of our personnel director from work. I don't mind doing it, but I often wonder how frequently I end up fixing someone else's computer as a favour. I'm glad to be able to show love and care for people in this way, but where is the line drawn before it becomes an imposition? The last couple of weeks, I've been staying up late reading, so I was looking forward to an early night, until I realized it would be more prudent to return this computer to its owner. *laugh* No rest for the weary, right? I found myself watching Joe Schmo 2 again tonight, instead of getting the rest I had been hoping for."
6,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Remind me, what did I write about before this? Or, a continuation in the 'is this a date?' saga. So, after the weird lunch, my confidence took a hit. I forgot to share an important part of the story with you guys. Before Pat arrived for lunch, Dustin started talking about what a great guy Pat is and how he's trying to find him a girlfriend. I listened and nodded, realizing we were discussing finding Dustin's best friend a partner more than engaging in typical small talk with a stranger over pink lemonade. I excused myself to the bathroom, looked in the mirror, and silently asked myself: am I being set up with the other guy? Is this what happens now?"
7,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"I would like everyone to think before they act. Ideally, I'd like each person in the world to think before they start their day, and make a commitment to keep thinking throughout. If they're not prepared to, I'd prefer they reconsider their daily activities. I'm frustrated with people who act impulsively. I'm not claiming to be the most intelligent person, but I'm not referring to complex issues. I believe it's reasonable to expect basic thoughtfulness. Let's focus on a few specific examples for now, and save others for another time, sound good? Great."
8,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Two problems with the scenario outlined in my previous post: 1. True, Bush is stimulating the economy, but in the wrong way. Robert Rubin told NPR's Marketplace today that Bush could have achieved the same stimulus effect without the long-term debt burden by enacting different tax cuts - temporary ones that would benefit low- and middle-income individuals. Ah, Robert Rubin - the sound of his name is music to our ears. Quick: name one Bush administration cabinet official on the domestic side with Rubin's stature. Still thinking? It'll come to you... 2. We can't give the Republicans control only in wartime because they've ingeniously concocted an endless, global 'war on terrorism.'"
10,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Do you ever have one of those moments when you begin to reflect on life? Like you're sitting in math class, feeling utterly bored, and you wonder what exactly goes on in your brain that enables you to comprehend math? You realize that you exist, and you're in math class, and you wonder why. Then you realize how amazing it is to exist. And suddenly it hits you - the fact that you're going off on this random train of thought is somewhat embarrassing. Ever had that happen? I dislike that feeling. You know what else I dislike? Block schedules. Who would ever conceive such an idea? It's clear that sitting through a two-and-a-half-hour class in any subject is a form of cruel and unusual punishment."
11,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"I think that Monopoly has run its course in my life, and I vow to never lay my hands on that iron piece again. Tonight, Andy beat me by a few small dollars and won the game, or maybe I let him win since he's leaving in a few short hours and I wanted him to feel good on his last night here. However the story goes, it can't compare to this Texas-sized headache I have at the moment. I've taken some Aleve, and I must say that they're doing the trick; all I need now is some well-deserved rest and relaxation. Your telephone's the one that helped me wrap the cord around your neck... At the drive-in."
12,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Today's been a long day, having driven home from Indiana. I'll have to be selective about what I write, as I could easily fill a lot of space and time, but I'm running low on energy. First off, I have to say that camp was amazing, exceeding my expectations. God has been doing incredible things in my life lately, and it's truly awesome. I've made a positive change, but I'll get back to the beginning. We arrived at the Twiggs' house on Friday evening and stayed until we left for camp on Monday. During our visit, we attended the fair, church, a parade, went to Walmart, and watched movies."
13,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Today is my last day of summer vacation! I'm filled with dread, and to make matters worse, I have a dentist appointment at 9. I dislike it, but I'd rather get it over with than try to schedule it during the first month of my surgery rotation. I'm definitely nervous, scared, and jittery about returning to school. This is going to be a whole new challenge for me. As a perfectionist, I love excelling at everything I do. However, starting new things can be overwhelming. I hate feeling uncertain (like I told Cassie: 'I'm going to be the only pawn on the chessboard who insists on moving like a knight'), and I hate not knowing what's going on."
14,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Arun Shourie discusses how the present Governor of Uttar Pradesh had warned, as far back as 1996, about the impending threat of the rise of a 'third Islamic state' in the subcontinent. T V Rajeswar, the former head of the Intelligence Bureau and the current Governor of Uttar Pradesh, had predicted this dire threat in a series of articles published in the Hindustan Times, way back in 1996. Shourie raises a valid point when he asks, does the fact that you now know that he, and not I, to say nothing of Mr. Advani, wrote all that make the warnings ring true? Or do you conclude that because he wrote in this vein, T V Rajeswar is a closet communalist and should be removed as Governor of Uttar Pradesh?"
15,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Attitude: bored, mood: indifferent, looking forward to tonight. It's been a long, arduous day in the trenches here today, folks, with almost no time to write anything for you readers. However, it's great to see Tigger (now Akcron) taking up the reins herself and making an appearance, discussing various topics. Not much to say, but yesterday's Shakespeare on the Green was a lovely play, albeit I had to leave before the closing curtain, which was disappointing. Hopefully, someday I'll see a Shakespeare play in its entirety. But I digress. Akcron is right about the shower issues; it's subpar. In terms of laughing at her in the shower, you have to admit, the look people get when enduring self-inflicted discomfort can be quite amusing."
16,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"All of a sudden, for the past two days, I've been overcome with terrible bouts of exhaustion - bone-dead exhaustion. Last evening, I went home and just slept off, only getting up when my mother called me around 8:30. When I woke up, it was all dark, and I hadn't switched the lights on, so I couldn't figure out the time or date for a few seconds. It was just my mother's voice in the darkness, and me grappling with reality. I wonder why I'm feeling so drained. The weather was nice this morning, though - it was drizzling when I arrived. Although, in Calcutta, I hear it's been raining for the past three days."
17,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Last night was the worst. I discarded the sweater I was knitting. I only had about 14 inches completed. I lost approximately $10 worth of yarn, which costs $8 per skein. However, it had too many stitches by the time I reached the arm holes, and the mohair was knotting itself together as I knitted, making frogging ineffective. The yarn broke frequently. I didn't even swear, which is unusual for me. I just ripped it out morosely and listened to season two of Sex and the City (thanks to the library!). Eventually, I grew tired of it and threw it away. I suppose I could say I gained valuable experience while attempting to knit this sweater."
18,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Last night in class, we discussed that week's assigned reading, ""Getting Back into Place: Toward a Renewed Study of the Place-World"" by Edward S. Casey. The first chapter explores ""implacement"" and the second, ""displacement."" Casey distinguishes that our contemporary world and culture revolve around time as the situating force: we're running out of time, we've saved time, we're just in time. He argues that using place as the center of culture fosters a more grounded community. (Please note that this is a rough summary, and I offer this disclaimer in case my professor or classmates happen to read this post.) So far, this book is the first reading that has truly resonated with me."
19,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Whatever it is they put into freeze pops to make them those vibrant colours, there should be some sort of warning: may make your life a bit bizarre. And whilst giggling is good, one wonders if we would have found ourselves up that fire escape drinking beer in the fierce wind had we not been indulging in them earlier. Finding ourselves in a doorway to a bar sadly closed for business, we stopped to examine an office-supplies catalogue that had arrived in the post. Lucky we did. Who could possibly have guessed that within these pages were the special offers of a lifetime? Not I, for certain. I list but a few: buy 36 permanent marker pens, get a stunt kite free. Buy 30 lever arch files, get a barbecue set."
20,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Currently listening to: The Little Drummer Boy by Stevan Pasero ...and now my post... Senate Republicans, hands up - who watched the 39-hour judicial nominations debacle last week? I know I didn't. Well, okay - I did tune in once or twice. The entire colossal waste of time was orchestrated by Republicans who, upset that Democrats wouldn't roll over and nominate four of Bush's contentious justices, were trying to score political points by holding a multi-day protest. Never mind the fact that the Democrats have already approved 168 of Bush's judicial nominees - no, that's not good enough for the power-hungry Republicans who are laboring under the misapprehension that they have a huge mandate for this kind of behavior, despite their actions being perceived as a cry-fest."
21,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"This was a good weekend. I spent a lot of time outdoors, after a long time, and I listened to a lot of Nevermore (something I should have started doing much earlier) and read extensively. I finished three books over the weekend - Bruce Sterling's Heavy Weather, Larry Niven's World of Ptavvs, and Octavia Butler's Parable of the Sower. Heavy Weather was a good cyberpunk romp through a near-future USA, devastated by global warming and general anarchy. While it was clever, well-paced, and altogether very convincing, I must confess that I failed to come away with any profound sensations about the story or the characters. Not that both aren't well-constructed and vividly etched - it's a good book, but not a great one, I suppose, lacking a lasting impact."
22,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Because this is the aftermath, the first week back from practicum was a struggle, but it's only in the second week that the smoke has really started to clear. Post-practicum trauma, a hidden epidemic, is only now coming to light. I was stricken, but an eventual meeting with the course coordinator allowed me to release my burden, and by doing so, I have prevented another person from being stuck with such a pedagogically deficient practicum school. Yesterday, Monday, I bumped into another aggrieved classmate who was quite determined to warn the student due to attend her school in the next practicum about how terrible it would be. I calmed her down, suggesting that we should approach the administrator first."
23,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Things are incredibly busy here at times, but there's always time for stress-relieving activities. I've found that I'm not very skilled at 8-ball and ping pong. Rick, the Canadian, consistently beats me - we have a ping pong table in the front lobby of our building, and it's always available for a quick game. Last night, I participated in an 8-ball tournament at the recreation tent, which we call the hot spot. It's equipped with a popcorn machine, multiple TVs, a jukebox, DVD rental, a pool table, a dartboard, and a ping pong table. I did fairly well throughout my one game, until I scratched on the eight ball. Despite that, I still had a good time, especially with the two Dutch soldiers who joined the tournament."
24,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"Fall 1974: I was attempting, for what felt like the thirteenth time, to fight my way through the second chapter of my high school algebra book. I was not then, nor am I now, a math enthusiast. I have an aversion to math, and it's safe to say I'm math-phobic. You get the idea. As I struggled to make sense of algebra, the doorbell rang. I put down my book and went to open the door, only to find no one there. Great. I returned to my studies and just as I was finding a glimmer of understanding buried in my subconscious, the doorbell rang again. Just like that, my breakthrough vanished. I went to the door, and once again, no one was there. Just what a struggling math student needs – an uninvited prankster."
25,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"This past week has been nothing short of exhausting. I spent Tuesday to Thursday finishing the move to my new classroom. The new room is bigger and closer to my grade level team, which are essential factors to consider as I spend hours preparing my room for this year. Had I known about the move prior to the end of my school year, I would have discarded many of the books and supplies I no longer use. Unfortunately, everything came with me. So this week was spent moving, unpacking, and purging extensively. I must thank my teammate Jill for her assistance with all of this. As she was still teaching this month in my old room, she and her lovely students kindly moved almost my entire room for me."

Even if I never carried your child, even if I was never married to you, even if we were never an official couple... I loved you deeply, and to this day that feeling resonates within my heart. Forever I will be reminded of the few nights we spent together, our hearts and limbs entwined in a soulful embrace, bathed in the salty darkness of an evening by the beach...

27,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"I'm uncomfortable. Investigative reporting seems very wrong to me. Or let me rephrase that, the article I'm working on and its consequences aren't exactly something I'm comfortable with. Perhaps it's because I don't believe in it enough, that I struggle to fully grasp its essence. The angst behind it, the full-out passion to question, eludes me. I've grown up in a country where questioning authority is discouraged. You just don't ask questions, or you face severe consequences - imprisonment or worse. I'm not used to this freedom of speech, not accustomed to questioning out loud. I'm not the easiest person to get along with, admittedly."
28,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,blog,"We had an outing yesterday with my colleagues at the bank. We visited Guintubdan, La Carolota. It was the first time for most of us. We trekked to the falls, a 30-minute walk that left us catching our breaths. Whew, but we made it. The icy water was invigorating, making our bodies numb from the cold. We only stayed for less than an hour before heading to the nearby waterfalls, another 30 minutes of trekking. However, the trip was worth it, as the falls looked calming and the scene was breathtaking. It felt like being one with nature, and I could hear my own heartbeat. Soaking in the cold water was like communing with Mother Earth. The cold air and water were enough to lull me to sleep, but we had to leave. The experience was truly rejuvenating."

With a month left before Ed leaves, I think the reality is starting to sink in for Ed and the rest of us. It sunk in for me a long time ago. I just hope Ed will be here for Bailey's surgery.

Luckily, I had brought a bag of eggs as a precaution. Connor had a great time searching for eggs in the park. On Sunday morning, he woke up excited, believing the Easter bunny had visited. There's nothing more heartwarming than seeing the excitement on your child's face. After the egg hunt, we all attended church. Although the Easter bunny is fun, we ensure our kids understand the true meaning of the holidays. This was Megan's first Easter, and she looked adorable in her jean dress and stockings."

Unfortunately, I somehow managed to get a flat tire. Luckily, I'm at work, so the guys are going to inflate it for me and make sure it holds air.

And when I go upstairs after arguing with Nicole about Kelli, like I just did a few minutes ago, and they want me to explain what's wrong. Honestly, can't they just give me space?

A baker's dozen of congressional Democrats, including four New Yorkers, has petitioned U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to dispatch international observers to Florida to oversee this year's presidential balloting there. I humbly disagree.

By Gary Fineout and Alfonso Chardy. The citizenship ceremony in Jacksonville seemed to proceed as usual, with nearly 200 people leaving as new Americans. Just before the new citizens departed the June 29 event, an immigration official directing the swearing-in ceremony encouraged them to visit a voter registration table – a common sight at naturalization ceremonies. However, this table was unusual: the individuals distributing forms were Republican volunteers, and the party affiliation box had been pre-checked to make all new voters members of the GOP. This raised suspicions for Linda Cross, who attended to watch her husband, Dario Cruz, take his citizenship oath."

As a non-American blogger, I've been somewhat hesitant to engage in these discussions, especially those about flags, but since I initiated the subject, I suppose I should share my thoughts. Firstly, I believe that having a law against flag-burning is utterly absurd. The moment you grant a symbol - any symbol - such automatic reverence and protection, you've taken a small but significant step towards totalitarianism. Symbols are inherently subjective - they don't inherently represent anything; it's the meaning people attribute to them or the significance they're given that matters."

Re: Loss of Continuity in PX Day Ahead Auction due to ISO Rule Changes 

The emergency tariff filing by the California ISO last Friday has had a detrimental impact on the PX Day Ahead Auction market. The combination of soft and hard caps results in a complete disconnect, posing unacceptable risk to all our participants. This change will likely not achieve the ISO's desired reduction in real-time energy sales and procurement. The overall effect is that supply will continue to favor the higher realized price opportunity offered by the ISO. The PX is petitioning Terry Winter of the ISO to immediately permit adjustment bids on any submitted schedule at any relevant price."

The rate schedule in effect from August 2000 through September 2000 results in a significantly larger commodity charge, as SDG&E customers will receive a lump sum reimbursement from SDG&E during those two months, leading to lower expected electric bills. Assuming the lump sum reimbursement is excluded from the implicit energy component, the average from June 2000 through January 2001 is 6.2 cents, and the implicit commodity average from February 2001 through December 2001 is 7.3 cents. The overall average implicit commodity from June 2000 through December 2001 remains 6.9 cents. For deliveries starting September 1, 2000, the average would still be 6.9 cents."

At its core, Magic: The Gathering is a social experience meant to be enjoyed with friends (or frenemies), filled with laughter, trash talk, and game-winning moments. Wizards of the Coast appears to have forgotten this. When playing with friends, you're unable to earn gold, which is crucial. Gold is so vital that a daily cap has been implemented, considering it unlocks everything in-game. However, be prepared for a lengthy and monotonous 1v1 grind against the computer or random opponents, with whom you can't even communicate.

98,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Being the 3rd installment in the trilogy, I'll address the drawbacks first. I generally dislike prequels, as they technically move the story backward rather than forward, which is an issue inherent to every prequel. However, they often provide additional story depth. The combat feels somewhat unrefined and lacks the sharpness that Arkham City achieved. As of this writing (26/10/2013), a game-breaking bug prevents the completion of a side mission, although the main storyline remains unaffected. Some gadgets are assigned to inconvenient hotkeys, requiring excessive keyboard navigation, which can disrupt combos during combat."
99,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"They basically fixed Shadow Warrior (2013), i.e. The boss fights are awesome, and the weapons feel very nice (maybe not as good as D44M's, but still solid). Enemies aren't too spongy if you're not too careless with handling elemental and upgrade aspects. The upgrade system is really balanced, and once you get the hang of it, it's not too tedious. The elemental mechanics and limited ammo gently encourage you to use different weapons. There are many cool, unique (a key distinction from Borderlands' 'rng' formula) weapons that remain viable throughout most of the game. The music is great, especially the main theme and, of course, Stan Bush's contributions."
101,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"I think this Assassin's Creed nailed the mechanics on all fronts, including ship battles, sailing, hunting, parkour, and more. I felt a stronger connection to this character as well. Although the story starts off rough, it significantly improves as you progress, a trend I've noticed in every AC game. Edward was an intriguing character, and the side characters were equally captivating. I found that the collectibles in this game held more significance than in previous ones, possibly due to their greater purpose in the game. While not required, they were enjoyable to obtain and rewarded in a balanced manner, making them feel worthwhile."
102,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"While I personally cannot recommend this game, it wasn't absolutely terrible. The gunplay is alright, provided you have the means to purchase gun parts, which is my primary concern: it's pay-to-win. If I could overlook this, the game would be enjoyable, as the hardsuit is fun to use and the HRV is an excellent concept. I'd prefer this game over any Call of Duty title, but its pay-to-win microtransaction format is off-putting for me. If you're comfortable with this model, then by all means, have fun. However, if you're like me and dislike pay-to-win games, it's best to let this one pass; it's not our cup of tea."
103,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"While not perfect, this game has been greatly enjoyable. The save system and possibility of sudden death can be frustrating at times. I'm on my first playthrough and lost my main character around hour 10 of 20ish. A reload option at that point would have been appreciated. I've since used a 3rd party mod/save tool to avoid such failures. Additionally, the aiming reticule is somewhat small and the zoom feature underpowered. Despite these issues, it's been a blast. I'm not typically a zombie fan, but the combination of strategy, missions, and first-person shooter/beat-em-up elements is great. I've been playing it as often as I can, always thinking 'just one more mission, just one more supply run' - or I'm eager to get to safety before shutting the game down."
104,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"An absolute great strategy game. Having played every single other wargame, including European Escalation and ALB, I have to say this one fits well. The number of units is impressive. Although I'm not sure of the exact count, there's a vast array. The graphics are stunning, the sounds are great, and the gameplay overall is epic. The in-game chat box at the main menu is surprisingly entertaining, and I'm not kidding. However, if anyone thinks this game is 'easy', or if you're new to the strategy genre, it may take some time to master. Don't get upset, you will lose units. Just plan ahead, always have anti-air and anti-tank defenses in place."
105,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"I was initially biased against this game before playing it, and I wasn't even sure about purchasing it. The portal gun and portal concept seemed unusual to me, despite my fondness for science fiction. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The jokes and voice acting in this game are phenomenal - just amazing. While it can be cheesy at times, the humor is generally well-executed. Each story character has their own unique sense of humor, and their distinct personalities shine through. The level design is also impressive. Notably, I never played the first Portal game, but I plan to do so if I can spare the time. Playing the sequel was what ultimately led me to consider playing the original."
106,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Let's start with the pros and cons, followed by my thoughts on this game. + Some of the best characters + Good story + Loads of content + Customizable character (you can choose to be male or female, or whatever you like) + You can have a relationship with most of your companions (yes, fangirls, you can have a love interest) - Bad graphics (although I don't think graphics really matter) - Weird and awkward love scenes - Invisible walls - One mission, in my opinion, was boring, but everyone has different tastes - This isn't necessarily bad or good, but for those who care, your protagonist can't talk. Now, for my thoughts. I love this game. It's probably one of the best RPGs or games in general that I've ever played. So, if you're an RPG fan, you probably already have this game."
107,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Yes, this is a nostalgia trip for thirty-somethings who remember watching the ever-irritating Timmy Mallet in the UK, just for the five-minute Transformers cartoon. The voice actors for Optimus, Megatron, Bumblebee, and many others return, and are instantly recognisable. The distinctive cartoon transformation sound is also present. Graphically, the cell-shaded presentation is perfect and very faithful to Generation One. But aside from that, it's actually a very enjoyable game. The combat mechanics are extremely well executed. Transforming mid-fight is often a necessity, and is seamlessly woven into combos, making it quite distinct from High Moon's excellent War for/Fall of Cybertron games. Another key distinction is the heavy focus on melee combat, but some enemies, such as Seekers, require a switch to a ranged blaster."

In my opinion, this is a great and enjoyable game, despite the format being somewhat frustrating (where the free-roam city area repopulates with new enemies upon story progression). I particularly enjoyed the 'dual play' segments (where you can play as Batman and an additional character), and the ability to use the controller for most segments of the game, but the mouse and keyboard for the tank combat segments, was greatly appreciated. Driving the Batmobile around the free-roam city, including when chasing APC commanders, is actually quite enjoyable once you master the use of brakes to skid around corners (and when you do, navigating the city becomes really enjoyable)."

Not for the faint hearted though - some cutscenes were pretty darn cruel and vivid. But when a game overall is so great, it's easier to spot the flaws, and here they are as I saw 'em: - no sli support - what a disappointment; I had to put the game away until I upgraded my card, as it ran poorly on my old dual gpu gtx 590.

Graphics: The game features a comic-like style. The graphics are very slick, with no unnecessary details and nice color schemes. This aesthetic works perfectly for the game. The graphics can be set to 'high' without putting excessive strain on your system. I run this game on an i5 Pentium processor, with an Nvidia GeForce 710m card and 8GB of memory, and it runs smoothly (Windows 8.1).

Controls: The game can be played with a keyboard and mouse, but also with an Xbox controller."

This is everything I wished a search game from the Call of Duty series would be. However, don't buy this game thinking it's similar to Call of Duty, Battlefield, or any other shooter game. It's a game in its own class and should be treated as such. I've lost count of how many times I hear new players express frustration and complain about getting killed quickly. Oh, the shock of getting shot in the face and dying - it's not like that doesn't happen in real life. Edit: Having played this game for a while now, I've spent a considerable amount of money on it. It's one of the best multiplayer games around, a great alternative to play when you're not in the mood for CS:GO."

The gameplay is solid, the art design is beautiful, the music is surprisingly high-quality and fitting, the story and world have piqued my interest, and the puzzles are entertaining. However, the standout aspect of this game is its comedic genius. If you've played any RPG since the genre's inception, you'll appreciate the various jokes, parodies, and references; if you're new to RPGs, the humor still makes it enjoyable. If you've played Final Fantasy 7 or X, you owe it to yourself to play this game - without giving too much away, I had to pause after 2 hours to give my cheeks a break from laughing and smiling so much. It's been a delight so far."
115,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"I'm really sorry, I try to be supportive of free-to-play games and indie developers, but I didn't enjoy this game. The description seemed appealing, but the execution fell short. As a fan of puzzle and exploration games, I found this game to be completely unintuitive. Despite looking up how to progress, I still didn't find the gameplay enjoyable. The lack of a pause button is also concerning, especially given the timed sequences. If a pause button exists, I couldn't find it. I feel that the game is overly reliant on cut scenes, leaving me with too much downtime. I often found myself waiting, drumming my fingers, rather than engaging with the game itself."
116,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"This game... Phew, where to even start. It was absolutely breathtaking, from the story to the graphics, I was hooked. The story wasn't just any story, but actually felt like I was that person, trying to figure out what came next in the narrative my character was telling. Gameplay was great, and I learned a lot about myself through this game, mainly my fear of heights, which I never had a problem with until the ice caverns. My gut churned the whole time, but I kept going for Uncle Fred. If you guys made a DLC or a second game, I would be the first to buy it and recommend it to everyone I know. Thanks to everyone involved in making this, you created an absolutely beautiful game."
117,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth is a turn-based game where you build your civilization to achieve a specific goal or 'victory'. Unlike previous games, which followed the Earth's timeline through periods like the Stone Age, Medieval Age, and Modern Age, this game takes place in the future, where you're on a mission to colonize a new planet. What I enjoy about this game is that 2K took a new approach and added innovative mechanics, such as the affinity system and orbital layer. However, I found that these new mechanics could be overwhelming at times. One potential improvement could be incorporating new artwork, such as the environment experienced when communicating with another leader, to further enhance the game. Overall, the game offers a fresh take on the series, but may benefit from some refinements to balance its complexity."
118,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Great game! Tons of replayability and a very fun zombie survival experience. Definitely in my top 5 zombie games ever played. Edit: After playing 60+ hours, I can honestly say this is one of the better, more realistic zombie games. It's designed like a survival horror, where you must conserve ammo, heal your own wounds when bleeding out, and take medication when infected. The zombies feel natural and are well-animated for a free-to-play game. I highly recommend playing with 1 or 2 friends, but the community is super friendly, and you can easily make friends or chat with others via voice comms or in-game chat."
119,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"02/07/2014 - it's a shame I can't thoroughly recommend or enjoy this game, as from the short time I've played it, I know I'd be addicted if it didn't have the following two major issues. No Australian servers - one red bar puts you at a severe disadvantage and creates unbearable lag. I played through the offline training mode, and it was stuttering and lagging as well, which is puzzling. This, combined with the poor ping, ruins the game. Everything is plagued by artifacts - menus, backgrounds, training, and in-game. I've never experienced this before with my graphics card, so I suspected it might not like my overclock. I set my GPU back to stock, but it didn't make a difference."
120,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Very late last night, I finished this. Although the story isn't particularly deep or interesting, the storytelling is what sets it apart. The atmosphere is richly detailed and the numerous collectibles do an excellent job of fleshing it out. I gained a lot of insight into the world of Batman, so it was somewhat disappointing that there were so few bosses in the game. However, there are plenty of future games to address this issue. The combat offers the right amount of challenge, but it's slightly on the easy side. Leveling up Batman wasn't very satisfying, as it's the gadgets you upgrade and acquire during the campaign that add nice new gameplay mechanics. Gaining access to previously unreachable places creates a nice sense of progression, and it's the storytelling that truly makes this game stand out."
121,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"'To the Moon' is no mere game... Nay, it is a veritable experience, and it was one of the best of my life at that. Think Telltale's 'The Walking Dead' is sad? Hohoho! Well, it's no match for 'To the Moon'! Never before have I felt so emotionally drained yet fulfilled over something purely fictional. This masterpiece represents the pinnacle of storytelling in my opinion, and the soundtrack is a gorgeously charming and perfect accompaniment. Yes, the controls can be a bit finicky and the gameplay isn't the strong point, but the story is so fantastic that I didn't care one bit. Plus, the humor is great as well and it seamlessly complements the distinguished nature of the story... And the 'Doctor Who' references are endless and delightful."
122,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Bastion is a bloody brilliant game, with a really great storyline. Set after a calamity has occurred, you begin to rebuild on the bastion. There's quite a lot of choice in the game, with options to build structures that give you an advantage, select weapons, and choose power-ups to enhance them, as well as consume drinks that provide bonus effects. The art style and music in the game are fantastic, with vibrant visuals that defy the typical dullness associated with apocalyptic settings. Best of all, the game features dynamic narration that responds to the player's actions. So, if you pick up a weapon and then switch to another in the armoury, the narration will acknowledge your new choice, saying something about taking the new weapon along."
123,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"I had originally purchased this game in its early development stages, when the only currency was spacebux and there was no 'tech tree'. This was when the game was enjoyable. All guns were equally overpowered at this point, eliminating any imbalance issues; everyone could kill each other at any time. The game also provided unlimited gun slots and five loadouts. Given the game's claim of having 'bajillions of guns', it's surprising that they only offer 6 weapon slots and 3 loadouts before requiring a purchase for more. At one point, I had accumulated about 3 pages worth of guns and was brainstorming new ideas, as that's where I found the game to be most enjoyable."
124,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"This game was a surprising gem. One often sees rave reviews of certain products that are often misleading. In this case, the reviews accurately reflect the fun of this neat little game. It's an odd yet stylish mix between a classic 2D platformer and a MOBA. I found myself enjoying characters that I wouldn't typically enjoy in other MOBA games. I had expected this trait to continue, but decided to give a melee tank a try anyway. I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome and ended up trying out more as they were unlocked through gameplay. The art style and interface are oddly charming. As a result, I now use one of the characters as my avatar and a wallpaper created from a card set for the game."
125,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"I just started playing, but I love this game. I put on my headphones and lose myself in the game for hours at a time. It's been a while since a game has had that effect on me. The music sets the mood, the sound effects are spot on, and the controls are perfect. I look forward to every combat, and they've optimized combat extremely well. I had my doubts about the naval combat system, but it is so much fun to lay waste to multiple fleets at a time! The only way to lose in this game is to fail to retreat. If the combat looks overwhelming, just get out of there, regroup, and counter-attack. Thanks, devs, for an awesome experience!"
126,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"The reboot of the Devil May Cry franchise has brought about many changes for the series, particularly for its protagonist, Dante. While fans of the original series may be upset at the change to their beloved character, it's certainly for the better; and this new game by Ninja Theory proves it. DmC serves as the perfect entry point for newcomers to jump into the series. It showcases the origins of an arrogant, cynical Dante, and chronicles his transformation from cynicism to selflessness. Throughout, the game weaves a clear narrative arc for the new Dante, making him a compelling character to watch. The story follows Dante as he's introduced into the corrupt world he had willfully chosen to ignore, now forced to confront it."
127,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Where do I start with this absolutely beautiful game? Its story is absolutely charming, with an impressive amount of detail and a delightful mix of happiness, bad puns, annoying dogs, and secrets. It strikes a perfect balance between seriousness and humor. The character design is exceptional, featuring diverse characters with unique personalities and secrets. What sets it apart from other RPGs is the absence of violence, a refreshing concept in the genre. Drawing inspiration from Earthbound, one of the best RPGs I've seen, it's clear that this game is something special. The soundtrack is also noteworthy, easily the best I've heard in a long time."
128,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"I am recommending this solely because it's free, and might be a more 'enjoyable' experience for others. As for my experience, the 'game' had little impact on me. Half the story relies heavily on shock value. I was neither shocked nor emotionally moved in any way by this. Perhaps I'm desensitized, or maybe it was too simplistic to elicit a reaction from me. As for the other half of the game, it attempts to portray a person's mental decline through a visual representation. It explores themes of obsession, hallucination, depression, and a few other topics. In theory, it's an intriguing concept. However, the 'game' took me only 10 minutes to complete, even with thoroughly reading and absorbing every detail."
129,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Do I even need to explain why Portal is amazing? Portal is a puzzle game that introduces a concept and then steps aside. It's an engaging way to challenge your mind while still being enjoyable. Although this game isn't as story-driven, it did give birth to one of the most popular games of 2011. I still play this game and beat it when I'm feeling bored, and I love to revisit what spawned a legend and what has become a legend. Gameplay: Portal's gameplay is relatively simple to explain.

Divinity: Dragon Commander reaches awfully close to the borders of my personal favorite RTS game. Combine this with a huge Risk-like grand strategy mode and it hits the spot. I try not to be overly biased, but the fact that this game allows you to turn into a dragon, supporting, attacking, and commanding unit production, direction, and spawning at the same time, is a major draw. Honestly, I do like complicated RTS games nowadays, such as Civ V. However, such games often attempt to cram complex mechanics, charts, and resources into one complicated game mode, which can be overwhelming."

The graphics are solid for a retro title, and the music is pleasant, but paired together they create truly beautiful and impactful moments. The script spans a wide range of emotions, from comedic to dramatic to heartbreaking to hopeful, often simultaneously, and does this while subverting RPG tropes. And all of this without touching on the world, characters, story, gameplay... I could write whole pages about it. But instead, I'll just say this: if you enjoy RPGs, play this game. If you enjoy video games, play this game. If you have seven free hours between now and your passing, play this game."

The developers are very active in the community, and their engagement is evident in the discussion forums and dev diaries. Although the game's mechanics have a fairly steep learning curve, which I'm still trying to master, this depth of strategy offers numerous ways to achieve goals and capitalize on certain situations. In my opinion, the game is almost infinitely replayable. I find myself fully immersed in every session, regardless of how the play-through unfolds."

After this period, you'll begin to notice that the game's offerings are limited to repetitive combat, enemies, and gameplay. A significant high point is the developers' dedication to regular updates, which often include substantial content, such as system overhauls, new warframes, and various tweaks and features. It's suitable for casual play. However, I doubt it will sustain your interest beyond a few months unless you enjoy grinding. The game's free-to-play model is a significant advantage, making it worth trying out. If you're looking for a brief gaming experience, I recommend giving it a try."
136,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"This game is extremely dull. I purchased it, believing it to be a PC version of 'Katamari Damacy', a popular and enjoyable PS2 game. Unfortunately, it falls short. The gameplay involves absorbing increasingly larger objects to grow bigger and absorb more. However, the gameplay isn't as smooth as it could be, the levels lack inventiveness, and the overall experience is a surreal, unsettling horror show. I don't mean an entertaining horror show, but one that leaves you feeling rather depressed and questioning the value of life. Every 'living' creature in the game, from small pets to human beings, makes me wonder if the creators had a fascination with taxidermy, given their lifeless and eerie portrayal."

I thought, 'oh wow, a simulator of the road to becoming president, that sounds fun!' Well, it really wasn't. The game starts you off and asks you to pick a side: Republican or Democrat, with no option for Independent or third-party affiliation. A little disappointed, but still optimistic, I continued to see what I could do. I will give the game credit, the character customization, although limited, is pretty enjoyable to experiment with. It's the only time it's an option to wear your head or not in a campaign – literally."

Some keys are hardcoded and cannot be rebound. The game is plagued by bugs. At one point, my Pip-Boy vanished permanently, and I had to research console commands to retrieve it. Power armor is readily available from the start, and power cores are abundant in trader shops, greatly diminishing its value. The story is mediocre, and most aspects of the game are unremarkable, except for its stability, which surpasses Fallout 3's frequent crashes. However, it doesn't live up to the hype, and it's not better than Fallout 3 or New Vegas. This title's actual quality falls short of expectations."

I wouldn't recommend this game unless it's heavily discounted (90% off), even then, playing it feels like a tedious chore, driven solely by the desire to complete it and move on to the next game in my library.

The learning curve and time required to do anything interesting at the start were too steep for me. Perhaps with more patience and gaming time, this would be compelling. However, I don't have either luxury, and there are plenty of other VR games I'd rather spend my time on. The game's scale, while impressive, ultimately felt like a barrier."
144,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,game_review,"Hands down, my all-time favorite first-person shooter. Run-and-gun enthusiasts need not apply. Recoil and ballistics are remarkably realistic. Single hits to the chest, neck, or head from rifle-caliber weapons almost always result in death, unless the shot merely grazes you. Rounds drop over distance, and short, controlled bursts are necessary to remain on target. There is no infinite ammunition pool. If you frequently reload mid-magazine, you'll end up with a pouch full of partially used mags. Endless sprinting is not an option. After prolonged sprinting, your aim will suffer as you gasp heavily until you've caught your breath. Resting your weapon on your elbows while prone or on a window sill helps steady your aim. Accuracy is compromised when standing, but improves when using cover or a stable position."

As a result, I never experienced the issues some people claim to have had with that game. I loved it, though - it was unforgiving in the early stages, but rewarding when you executed things correctly. As for XCOM2, I'm a big fan; the game runs smoothly for me on medium settings, even with a GTX560 and 2GB of VRAM. Initially, the game was set to high, and it ran a bit sluggishly, but not to the point of being unplayable. However, when I dropped it down to medium, the performance improved significantly. I'm not sure if I'm just lucky when it comes to avoiding issues with games, but many of the negative reviews seem to be coming from people with unrealistic expectations."

Lee Miller scored inside the opening minute, heading over Colin Meldrum and into the net from a Jamie McAllister free kick. McAllister himself scored the second when he met Saul Mikoliunas' cross at the back post, effectively putting the game beyond the visitors' reach. Craig Easton headed in a contentious goal after an hour, but Hearts held on. The opening goal came after Gus Bahoken had clumsily fouled Miller 35 yards from goal. McAllister floated the free kick into the Livingston box, and Miller outjumped the static visiting defence to loop his header from 10 yards over Meldrum. With just 10 minutes on the clock, the home side doubled their lead. Mikoliunas sprinted down the right, delivering a cross to the back post where McAllister timed his run to head past Meldrum."

However, the effectively linear interaction between motion and light or electricity restricts access to a broader class of quantum states of motion, such as cat states or energy squeezed states. Early optomechanical proposals suggested overcoming this limitation by establishing strong quadratic coupling of motion to light.

Unfortunately, these evaluations can be manipulated by professional spammers using fake reviews, who continually adapt and refine their spamming strategies to evade detection.

Moreover, existing detectors prioritize detection accuracy, which may not align with maintaining the trustworthiness of product evaluations. To address these challenges, we propose a minimax game where spammers and spam detectors compete based on practical goals that extend beyond detection accuracy. The Nash equilibria of this game yield stable detectors that are robust to various detection strategies, ensuring the reliability of product evaluations."

To ensure high fidelity, we employed the Lewis-Riesenfeld (L-R) method to derive a family of solutions leading to an exact transfer, where the solutions follow a single dynamical mode of the L-R invariant. Among this family, we identified a tracking solution with a single parameter to control simultaneously the fidelity of the transfer, the population of the excited state, and robustness. We defined a measure of the robustness of an ultra-high fidelity transfer as the minimum percentile deviation on the pulse areas at which the infidelity rises above $10^{-4}$. The robustness of our shaped pulses was found to be superior to that of Gaussian and adiabatically-optimized pulses for moderate pulse areas."

Due to nonconvexity, multiple local minima exist that are not globally optimal, even when the mixture components are well-separated. We demonstrate that all local minima exhibit a common structural form, which partially identifies the component centers of the true mixture. Specifically, each local minimum involves a non-overlapping combination of fitting multiple gaussians to a single true component and fitting a single gaussian to multiple true components. Our findings apply to the setting where the true mixture components meet a certain separation condition, and remain valid even when the number of components is over- or under-specified. For gaussian mixtures with three components, we derive more precise results in terms of the scaling with the separation between the components."

A widely used tool for detecting entanglement is an entanglement witness, where the measurement of the witness operator is guaranteed to be positive for all separable states and can be negative for certain entangled states. In reality, due to the exponentially increasing Hilbert-space dimension with respect to the system size, constructing an efficient entanglement witness for general multipartite entangled states is very challenging. For $n$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-like states, the most robust witness scheme requires $n+1$ local measurement settings and can tolerate up to $1/2$ white noise. In contrast, the most efficient witness for GHZ-like states only needs two local measurement settings and can tolerate up to $1/3$ white noise."

We develop a general method to extract the multipole moments of arbitrary stationary spacetimes and apply it to a large family of horizonless microstate geometries. These geometries can break the axial and equatorial symmetry of the Kerr metric, yielding a richer multipolar structure that provides a portal to constrain fuzzball models phenomenologically. We find numerical evidence that all multipole moments are typically larger in absolute value than those of a Kerr black hole with the same mass and spin. Current measurements of the quadrupole moment of black-hole candidates impose only mild constraints on fuzzballs, while future gravitational-wave detections of extreme mass-ratio inspirals with the LISA space mission will significantly improve these bounds."

In practice, long-term edges are often manually specified by humans, which can be costly and suboptimal for downstream tasks. To address these issues, we propose a model based on temporal point processes and variational autoencoders that learns to infer temporal attention between nodes by observing node communication patterns. As temporal attention drives feature propagation between nodes, leveraging the dynamics of node interactions to learn this key component offers greater flexibility while avoiding issues associated with manually specified edges."

The equivariant stable homotopy groups of every global spectrum form a global Mackey functor, so these splittings imply that certain long exact homotopy group sequences decompose into short exact sequences.

Operationally, a nonparametric density estimate is required, and proper selection of the amount of smoothing, which governs the density's shape and possibly its modal structure, is crucial for identifying the final partition. In this work, we address the issue of density estimation for modal clustering from an asymptotic perspective, focusing on the estimation process."
215,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"The tails of diboson production at the LHC are sensitive to the interference between the Standard Model and higher-dimensional operators that parameterize the effects of heavy new physics. However, helicity selection rules for diboson scattering amplitudes pose an obstruction to the naive interference contributions of dimension-six operators, causing the leading contribution to the total diboson rate correction to cancel. In this case, carefully measuring the azimuthal decay angles ""resurrects"" the interference, recouping sensitivity to the ""non-interfering"" operators. We explore these signatures in detail and find that the EFT uncertainties associated with higher-dimensional operators are uniquely well-suppressed by constructing an asymmetry variable generated solely by these non-interfering operators, relegating the effects of higher-dimensional, interfering operators to the same status as statistical errors in this observable."
216,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"Causal inference from observational data is a primary objective of numerous data analyses in the health and social sciences. However, traditional academic statistics has often been skeptical of data analyses with a causal focus. The emergence of the term ""data science"" presents a historic opportunity to redefine data analysis, allowing it to seamlessly incorporate causal inference from observational data. Similar to previous frameworks, we categorize the scientific contributions of data science into three task classes: description, prediction, and counterfactual prediction, which encompasses causal inference. A clear classification of data science tasks is essential for discussing the data, assumptions, and analytics required to successfully accomplish each task. We argue that a failure to adequately describe the role of subject-matter expert knowledge in data analysis is a source of widespread misunderstandings about data science."
217,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"The weak gravity conjecture (wgc) necessitates the existence of superextremal particles in any consistent quantum theory of gravity. The standard lore posits that these particles ensure extremal black holes are unstable or marginally stable, but the implications of this not occurring are unclear. This note demonstrates that, for a generic Einstein quantum theory of gravity in AdS, exact stability of extremal black branes conflicts with rigorously proven quantum information theorems regarding entanglement entropy. Resolving this contradiction yields a nonperturbative version of the wgc, which aligns with the usual statement at weak coupling. The argument is general, relying solely on the validity of Einsteinian gravity, effective field theory, and holography, without invoking supersymmetry or a specific UV completion."
218,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"Understanding how strongly correlated two-dimensional systems can give rise to unconventional superconductivity with high critical temperatures is a major unsolved problem in condensed matter physics. Ultracold 2D Fermi gases have emerged as ideal model systems to study the interplay of strong correlations and reduced dimensionality, but direct evidence of superfluidity in these systems has been lacking. Here, we demonstrate superfluidity in an ultracold 2D Fermi gas by moving a periodic potential through the system and observing no dissipation below a critical velocity v$_{\rm c}$. We measure v$_{\rm c}$ as a function of interaction strength and find a maximum in the crossover regime between bosonic and fermionic superfluidity. Our measurement establishes ultracold Fermi gases as a powerful tool for studying the influence of reduced dimensionality on strongly correlated superfluids, providing new insights into this phenomenon."
219,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"Ordinary differential equation (ode) is a mathematical model widely used in various application areas, including climatology, bioinformatics, and chemical engineering, due to its intuitive appeal to modeling. Despite its widespread use in modeling, the frequent absence of analytic solutions makes it challenging to estimate ode parameters from data, particularly when the model involves numerous variables and parameters. This paper proposes a Bayesian ode parameter estimation algorithm that is both fast and accurate, even for models with multiple parameters. The proposed method approximates an ode model with a state-space model based on the equations of a numeric solver, enabling fast estimation by avoiding computations of the entire numerical solution in the likelihood. The posterior is obtained using a variational Bayes method, specifically the approximate Riemannian conjugate gradient method (Honkela et al."

We find that the differential conductance and induced pairing amplitudes exhibit a strong dependence on the angle between the junction direction in real space and the axis separating the Weyl nodes in momentum space. We investigate the influence of a chiral chemical potential, namely the electron population imbalance between Weyl nodes of opposite chirality, on the junction's transport characteristics. Notably, we observe a net spin polarization of Cooper pairs generated via Andreev reflection in the two WSM regions. The spin polarization is opposite in the two WSM regions and highly sensitive to the chirality imbalance and excitation energy."
221,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"Metal ion implantation into ceramics has been demonstrated to be an effective and controllable technique for tailoring the surface electrical conductivity of the ceramic piece, and this approach has been utilized in various applications. Importantly, it provides a method for grading the voltage drop across high voltage insulators, thereby increasing the maximum operational voltage that can be applied across the insulator without surface flashover. However, a concern for the use of this method is the long-term stability of the implantation-induced conductivity, particularly if the implanted metal species is prone to oxidation. Here we report on our examination of the long-term behavior of the surface conductivity of titanium-implanted alumina. The results indicate that after an initial drop of up to 40% in the first few weeks following implantation, the conductivity exhibits only a very slow decrease of approximately 10% over the subsequent year."
222,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"We introduce a novel Skyrme-like conserved current in the effective theory of pions and vector mesons, grounded in the concept of hidden local symmetry. The associated charge is equivalent to the skyrmion charge for any smooth configuration. Furthermore, singular configurations can be identified as n_f=1 baryons, which are charged under this new symmetry. Under this identification, vector mesons assume the role of Chern-Simons vector fields residing on the quantum Hall droplet that constitutes the n_f=1 baryon. We propose that this current is the correct effective expression for the baryon current at low energies. This proposal provides a unified picture for the two types of baryons, enabling them to transform into each other in a natural manner. Additionally, Chern-Simons dualities on the droplet can be interpreted as a result of Seiberg-like duality between gluons and vector mesons."
223,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"Interfacial spin-orbit coupling in Josephson junctions offers an intriguing approach to combining anomalous Hall and Josephson physics within a single device. We theoretically investigate how the superposition of both effects influences the transport properties of superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator/superconductor junctions. The transverse momentum-dependent skew tunneling of Cooper pairs through the spin-active ferromagnetic insulator interface generates substantial transverse Hall supercurrents, which we term anomalous Josephson Hall effect currents. By generalizing the Furusaki-Tsukada formula, initially established to quantify conventional Josephson current flows, we evaluate the transverse current components and demonstrate that their amplitudes can be widely adjusted through the spin-orbit coupling strengths or the superconducting phase difference across the junction. Well-localized subgap bound states form around the interface, serving as a clear spectroscopic fingerprint of Josephson junctions."
224,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"Following the suggestion from Monte-Carlo experiments in Jiménez, J. of Turbul. (2020), that dipoles are as crucial to the dynamics of decaying two-dimensional turbulence as individual vortex cores, it is found that the kinetic energy of this flow is carried by elongated streams formed by the concatenation of dipoles. Vortices separate into a family of small, fast-moving cores and another family of larger, slowly moving ones, which can be described as 'frozen' into a slowly evolving 'crystal'. The kinematics of both families differ significantly, and only the former exhibits self-similarity. The latter is responsible for most of the flow's kinetic energy, and its vortices form the dipoles and streams. The growth mechanisms of this slow component are discussed."

Often, the running time of quantum algorithms in this framework is characterized by the quantum hitting time, which is the time required for the quantum walk to locate a vertex of interest with high probability. In this article, we provide improved upper bounds for the quantum hitting time that can be applied to various ctqw-based quantum algorithms. In particular, we apply our techniques to the glued-trees problem, improving the hitting time upper bound by a polynomial factor from $o(n^5)$ to $o(n^2\log n)$. Furthermore, our methods also help to exponentially improve the precision dependence of the continuous-time quantum walk-based algorithm for finding a marked node on any ergodic, reversible Markov chain by Chakraborty et al."

Dry (or the ""loss-cone"") EMRIs, previously considered the primary EMRI sources for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, are primarily produced by multi-body scattering in the nuclear star cluster and gravitational capture. In this letter, we highlight an alternative EMRI formation channel: wet EMRI formation facilitated by the accretion flow around accreting galactic-center massive black holes (MBHs). In this channel, the accretion disk captures stellar-mass black holes initially moving on inclined orbits, and subsequently drives them to migrate towards the MBH – this process significantly boosts the formation rate of EMRIs in such galaxies by orders of magnitude."

Under such circumstances, we still expect our recommender systems to attract users at first glance, encouraging them to stay on the website and become active users. This problem falls into the new user cold-start category, which is crucial to a company's development and even survival. Existing works on user cold-start recommendation often require additional user efforts, such as setting up an interview process, or utilize side information [10] like user demographics, locations, and social relations. However, users may be unwilling to participate in interviews, and side information on cold-start users is usually unavailable."
228,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"Deep learning has solved many problems that were previously out of reach of heuristic algorithms. It has also been successfully applied in wireless communications, despite the fact that current radio systems are well-understood and optimal algorithms exist for many tasks. While some gains have been obtained by learning individual components of a receiver, a more effective approach is to jointly learn the entire receiver. This, however, often results in a challenging nonlinear problem, for which the optimal solution is impractical to implement. To address this, we propose a deep fully convolutional neural network, deeprx, which executes the entire receiver pipeline from frequency domain signal stream to uncoded bits in a 5G-compliant manner. We facilitate accurate channel estimation by constructing the input of the convolutional neural network in a specific manner, utilizing both data and pilot symbols."
229,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"Mutation-based fuzzing typically uses an initial set of non-crashing seed inputs (a corpus) from which to generate new inputs by mutation. A corpus of potential seeds often contains thousands of similar inputs, resulting in a lack of diversity. This can lead to wasted fuzzing effort due to exhaustive mutation from all available seeds. To address this, fuzzers are equipped with distillation tools (e.g., afl-cmin) that select the smallest subset of seeds that trigger the same range of instrumentation data points as the full corpus. Minimizing the number and cumulative size of seeds is a common practice that is believed to lead to more efficient fuzzing, which we explore systematically. We present results of over 34 cpu-years of fuzzing with five distillation approaches to understand their impact on finding bugs in real-world software."
230,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"In this paper, we investigate multi-agent discrete-event systems with partial observation. The agents can be grouped into several categories, each with similar (isomorphic) state transition structures, allowing them to be relabeled into the same template. A scalable supervisor is designed based on this template, with a state size and computational cost independent of the number of agents, for the case of partial observation. Notably, the scalable supervisor under partial observation does not require recomputation, regardless of the number of agents added to or removed from the system. We extend our previous results to partial observation by proposing sufficient conditions for safety and maximal permissiveness of the scalable least restrictive supervisor at the template level. An example is provided to illustrate the proposed scalable supervisory synthesis approach."

A type of Gohberg-Semencul factorization of the model covariance matrix is employed, leveraging the Toeplitz structure of the covariance matrix. Notably, this approach incorporates, for the first time in ENF analysis, a non-rectangular temporal window preceding spectral estimation. Krylov matrices facilitate fast implementation of matrix inversions. The proposed approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods in ENF estimation when employing a short 1-second time window in power recordings. In speech recordings, the proposed approach yields highly accurate results, balancing time complexity and accuracy."

As a corollary, regularized regression estimators based on these reduced dimension spaces are provided, ranging from classical principal component regression to sparse partial robust M regression. The package also contains a set of classical and robust pre-processing utilities, including generalized spatial signs, as well as dedicated plotting functionality and cross-validation utilities. Finally, direpack has been written consistent with the scikit-learn API, allowing the estimators to seamlessly integrate into statistical and/or machine learning pipelines within that framework."

Here, we studied the anomalous saturating effect of the nitrogen vacancy defect in diamond. The fluorescence reduction was observed with high-power laser excitation, increasing the nonlinearity of the fluorescence emission and altering the spatial frequency distribution of the fluorescence image. We employed a differential excitation protocol to extract high spatial frequency information. By modulating the excitation laser's power, the spatial resolution of imaging was improved approximately 1.6 times compared to confocal microscopy. Due to the simplicity of the experimental setup and data processing, we expect this method can be used to enhance the spatial resolution of sensing and biological labeling with defects in solids."
234,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,paper_abstract,"When random effects are correlated with sample design variables, the conventional approach of using individual survey weights (constructed to be inversely proportional to the unit survey inclusion probabilities) to form a pseudo-likelihood no longer yields asymptotically unbiased inference. We develop a weight-exponentiated formulation for the random effects distribution that facilitates unbiased inference for generating hyperparameters of the random effects. In contrast to frequentist methods that rely on numerical integration, our approach uniquely achieves both unbiased estimation with respect to the sampling design distribution and consistency with respect to the population generating distribution. Our simulations and a real data example from a survey of business establishments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across various modeling formulations and sampling designs. This work serves as a culmination of recent efforts to integrate traditional survey estimation approaches with the Bayesian modeling paradigm, bridging the gap between these two distinct sub-fields."

Notably, it was discovered that in a mesogenic polymer, unlike low-molecular-weight mesogens, the relaxation of electric birefringence in a melt above the nematic-isotropic phase transition temperature can be described by a sum of several exponential processes, with two dominant processes playing a crucial role. These primary processes replace each other within a temperature range of approximately fifty degrees. Dielectric spectroscopy also enabled the distinction of two orientational relaxation processes: one attributed to the rotation of side mesogenic groups, and the other associated with the motion of main chain segments."

Optimizing discrete hash bits remains a key focus in these methods. A common strategy involves adopting an activation function, such as $\operatorname{sigmoid}(\cdot)$ or $\operatorname{tanh}(\cdot)$, and minimizing a quantization loss to approximate discrete values. However, this approach can cause more hash bits to become stuck in the wrong saturated area of the activation functions, never escaping. We refer to this issue as the ""dead bits problem"" (dbp). Furthermore, existing quantization losses can exacerbate dbp. This paper proposes a simple yet effective gradient amplifier that precedes activation functions to mitigate dbp."

The former is constrained by LHC disappearing charged track searches and dark matter direct detection experiments, while the latter is constrained by existing multilepton collider searches. We find that a two-step electroweak phase transition involving a stable triplet with a negative quadratic term is ruled out by direct detection searches, while an unstable triplet with a mass below 230 GeV is excluded at a 95% confidence level."

The standard scenario assumes an initially circular and narrow belt of planetesimals at semi-major axis $a$, whose eccentricity is increased to $e_f$ after the gas disc has dispersed due to secular perturbations from an eccentric planet, resulting in a belt of width $2ae_f$. A minor modification of this scenario suggests that narrower belts can form if the planetesimals are initially eccentric, possibly resulting from earlier planet perturbations during the gas-rich protoplanetary disc phase. Alternatively, a primordial eccentricity could be caused by instabilities that increase the disc eccentricity, eliminating the need for planetary involvement."

In one dimension (1D), the physics of interacting electrons is well-captured at low energies by the Tomonaga-Luttinger-Liquid (TLL) model, yet little has been observed experimentally beyond this linear regime. Here, we report on measurements of many-body modes in 1D gated-wires using a tunnelling spectroscopy technique. We observe two separate Fermi seas at high energies, associated with spin and charge excitations, along with the emergence of three additional 1D 'replica' modes that strengthen as the wire length decreases. The effective interaction strength in the wires is varied by changing the amount of 1D inter-subband screening, which is adjusted by over 45%."

Methods: We combined kinematic information from Gaia for nearly all galactic clusters with the largest sample of cluster ages available, after correcting for systematic errors.

To facilitate easy access to these novel estimators, the package contains a few high-level, intuitive functions that rely on a broader set of efficient, low-level routines. Intrinsic encompasses models that fall into two categories: homogeneous and heterogeneous intrinsic dimension estimators. The first category comprises the two-nn and gride models. The functions dedicated to these two methods carry out inference under both the frequentist and Bayesian frameworks. In the second category, we find hidalgo, a Bayesian mixture model, for which an efficient Gibbs sampler is implemented."

In this paper, we identify a surprising consequence of popularity-based rankings: when fewer items report a given signal, they collectively attract a higher share of overall traffic. This 'few-get-richer' effect emerges in settings with few distinct item classes (e.g., left- versus right-leaning news sources) and popularity-based rankings. We demonstrate analytically that the effect occurs when people click on top-ranked items and have diverse preferences for item classes. Using simulations, we analyze how the effect's strength changes with setting and human behavior assumptions. We also experimentally test our predictions in an online study with human participants. Our findings have important implications for understanding the spread of misinformation, particularly in settings with limited item diversity and popularity-driven user behavior."

However, most pruning techniques are essentially trade-offs between model accuracy and regularity, leading to impaired inference accuracy and limited on-device acceleration performance. To address this issue, we introduce a new sparsity dimension, namely pattern-based sparsity, which comprises pattern and connectivity sparsity, enabling both high accuracy and hardware friendliness. With carefully designed patterns, our proposed pruning method consistently achieves accuracy enhancement and improved feature extraction ability on different DNN structures and datasets. Our pattern-aware pruning framework also enables simultaneous pattern library extraction, pattern selection, pattern and connectivity pruning, and weight training. By leveraging this new pattern-based sparsity, our approach naturally integrates with compiler optimization for highly efficient DNN execution on mobile platforms."

260,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"I want to share with you the future of money. Let's begin with a story about the Yap culture in Micronesia in the early 1900s. I'd like to highlight the Yap because their form of currency is particularly fascinating. They utilize massive limestone discs known as rai stones. The Yap don't physically move or exchange these rai stones as we do with coins, due to their enormous size. The largest rai stone weighs about four tons and measures 12 feet across. Instead, the Yap keep track of ownership by recording who possesses a portion of each stone. There's a notable story about sailors transporting a stone across the ocean when they encountered trouble, resulting in the stone falling into the water."
261,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"You’ve been accused of a crime you did not commit. It’s impossible to prove your innocence. If you insist on your innocence, you’ll likely be found guilty and face execution. But if you confess, apologize, and implicate others, you’ll be set free. Do you give a false confession or risk a public hanging? This was the choice facing those accused of witchcraft in Salem, Massachusetts, between February 1692 and May 1693. They were victims of paranoia about the supernatural, misdirected religious fervor, and a justice system that prioritized repentance over truth. Salem was settled in 1626 by Puritans, a group of English Protestants. Life was strict and isolated for the people of Salem, with frequent battles against their Native American neighbors and groups of French settlers."
262,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"There are currently hundreds of thousands of people on transplant lists, waiting for critical organs like kidneys, hearts, and livers that could save their lives. Unfortunately, there aren’t nearly enough donor organs available to meet that demand. What if, instead of waiting, we could create brand-new, customized organs from scratch? That’s the idea behind bioprinting, a rapidly evolving branch of regenerative medicine. We’re not yet able to print complex organs, but simpler tissues, including blood vessels and tubes responsible for nutrient and waste exchange, are already within our reach. Bioprinting is a biological counterpart of 3D printing, a technique that deposits layers of material on top of each other to construct a three-dimensional object one layer at a time."

I'll begin with an anecdote, or for Monty Python fans, a sketch reminiscent of the iconic series. Here it is: December 15, 2010. Imagine someone offers you a bet: you gaze into a crystal ball, and the future it reveals will be accurate, but you must share it with the world. Curiosity gets the better of you, and you take the bet. You look into the crystal ball. One hour later, you're sitting in a national TV building, on a top show, sharing the story."

He's been hailed as the voice of a generation, and he's producing classic songs at an incredible rate, but a small minority of dissenters claim that Bob Dylan is borrowing from other artists. Fast forward to 2004. Brian Burton, aka Danger Mouse, takes the Beatles' ""White Album,"" combines it with Jay-Z's ""The Black Album"" to create ""The Grey Album."" ""The Grey Album"" becomes an instant online sensation, and the Beatles' record company sends out numerous cease-and-desist letters for ""unfair competition and dilution of their valuable property."" Now, ""The Grey Album"" is essentially a remix."

I began with that sentence about 12 years ago, initially focusing on developing countries, but you're here today from every corner of the globe. If you envision a map of your country, I think you'll realize that for every nation on earth, you could draw small circles to identify areas where good teachers are reluctant to go. Notably, these are often the places from which trouble originates. We have an ironic problem – good teachers tend to avoid the very places where they're needed most. I started in 1999 to address this issue with a simple experiment in New Delhi, which aimed to find a solution."

Given the majority of refugees living in urban areas, there is a strong need for a paradigm shift and innovative thinking. Rather than investing in building walls, it would be more beneficial to allocate funds to programs that empower refugees to become self-sufficient. (applause) We are often forced to leave behind all our possessions, but not our skills and knowledge. If allowed to live a productive life, refugees can support themselves and contribute to the development of their host country.

267,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"I have two questions for you. One: whose shoulders do you stand on? and two: what do you stand for? These are two questions that I always begin my poetry workshops with students because, at times, poetry can seem like a stagnant art form associated with old white men who appear to have been born with an air of agelessness, reminiscent of Benjamin Button. And I ask my students these two questions, then share how I answer them, which is in these three sentences: I am the daughter of black writers, who are descended from freedom fighters who broke their chains and changed the world. They call me. These are words I repeat in a mantra before every single poetry performance. In fact, I was doing it in the corner over there, preparing myself. I was making faces, getting into character."

(laughter) Hello. I painted myself white, stood on a box, placed a hat or a can at my feet, and when someone came by and dropped in money, I handed them a flower – along with some intense eye contact.

269,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"On October 4, 1957, the world watched in awe and fear as the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the world's first man-made satellite, into space. This small metal sphere, approximately two feet in diameter, sparked a space race between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. that would last eighteen years and transform the world as we know it. Sputnik was not the first piece of human technology to enter space; that distinction belongs to the V-2 rocket used by Germany in missile attacks against Allied cities during the final years of World War II. Although ineffective, the V-2 rocket technology and its scientists were captured by both the U.S. and U.S.S.R. at the end of the war, and they began utilizing them for their own projects."

A simple word describing a natural biological process, weighed down by centuries of stigma, has been transformed into something most of us can only speak about in hushed tones. But why? As I speak to you right now, over 800 million women worldwide are experiencing a period. None of us would exist without it, and yet it remains a sensitive subject to discuss. From my experience and that of the women around me, I can attest that it's draining. It's draining to discreetly take out a brown paper bag hiding a pad, quickly stuffing it into your pocket in the middle of a class and rushing to the washroom as unobtrusively as possible. It's draining to sit through lessons and meetings pretending to be absolutely normal, while internally struggling with intense period cramps."

Unfortunately, during my visit, I couldn't find one, but the antlers serve as proof. Across the boreal, we're fortunate to have an incredible abundance of wetlands. Wetlands, globally, are among the most endangered ecosystems. They're crucial ecosystems, purifying air and water, sequestering large amounts of greenhouse gases, and supporting a vast diversity of species."

Four brothers wandered this celestial realm, having no family other than each other – they didn’t even know who their parents were. One of the brothers, Deminan, looked different from the others; his skin was covered in painful scabs, and he wondered why he alone had been marked with this affliction. One day, while the supreme spirit Yaya was out in his gardens, Deminan and his brothers snuck into Yaya's house. After feasting and exploring, they spotted a giant gourd hanging in the corner. However, as they tried to look inside the gourd, it slipped from their grasp and fell."
275,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"I had graduated seven years ago from Berkeley with a dual degree in molecular and cell biology and linguistics. I attended a career fair on campus, where I secured an interview with a start-up called Theranos. At the time, there was limited information about the company, but what was available was impressive. Essentially, Theranos was developing a medical device that could run an entire blood panel from a finger-stick of blood. This meant that patients wouldn't need to undergo a venipuncture to get their blood test done. This concept was intriguing not only because it was less painful but also because it could potentially open the door to predictive diagnostics, making it a groundbreaking innovation in the field of healthcare."
276,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"My journey to become a polar specialist, photographing and specializing in the polar regions, began when I was four years old, when my family relocated from southern Canada to northern Baffin Island, near Greenland. There, we lived among the Inuit in a tiny community of 200 Inuit people, where we were one of three non-Inuit families. In this community, we lacked modern amenities - no television, computers, or radio, and not even a telephone. As a result, I spent all my time outdoors with the Inuit, playing and learning. The snow and ice served as my playground, and the Inuit were my guides. This is where my true fascination with the polar realm began."

We receive individuals for whom all other options have been exhausted, people who have fallen through the cracks of every other social safety net. They can't accommodate them, so we must. That's our role: to contain and control them. Over the years, as a prison system, as a nation, and as a society, we've become highly skilled at this, but that shouldn't be a source of pride. Today, we incarcerate more people per capita than any other country in the world. We have more black men in prison today than were enslaved in 1850."

To do that, I need to explain the origin of the solar system. Going back four and a half billion years, a cloud of gas and dust existed. At its center, our sun formed and ignited. Alongside, the planets, comets, and asteroids we know today formed. According to theory, after the Earth cooled down following its formation, comets heavily impacted the planet, delivering water to Earth. They likely also delivered complex organic material, potentially bootstrapping the emergence of life. This process is crucial to understanding the mission's significance."

When we launched the ""Build Back Better"" series, our goal was to explore ways to address the challenges posed by the pandemic and envision a path forward. However, the tragic events of the past week, including the horrific death of George Floyd and the subsequent daily protests, have introduced a new sense of urgency that we must acknowledge. Can we build back better from this? I believe that before we can even begin to answer that question, we must first strive to comprehend the magnitude of this moment.

280,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"In 1903, the President of the United States embarked on a three-day camping trip in California's Yosemite Valley. President Theodore Roosevelt slept beneath a grove of towering sequoia trees, braved a snowstorm, and spent hours conversing around the campfire with his host and guide, renowned conservationist John Muir. Roosevelt was famously enamored with the outdoors, but Muir had invited him for a more pressing purpose: Yosemite was in peril. Although Yosemite had been designated as protected land in 1864, the valley remained vulnerable to overdevelopment in 1903. It was at the heart of a decades-long struggle to balance preservation and public use – two objectives that proved far more challenging to achieve than they were to articulate. The battle over Yosemite's fate began with the 1849 gold rush, when a surge of miners flocked west in search of gold in the Sierra Nevada foothills."

My journey began 14 years ago, when I was a young reporter fresh out of college. I stumbled upon a scoop that, although simple, had significant implications. Police officers were accepting bribes from street vendors, a practice that was widely known but largely ignored. I decided to take a different approach to expose this corruption, one that would have maximum impact. I went undercover, posing as a vendor, and was able to gather concrete evidence. The impact was substantial, and this style of reporting is often referred to as immersion or undercover journalism. The story was quite straightforward, but as a young reporter, I thought it was essential to present it in a way that would spark change. I got a scoop, and it was a great start to my career."

A new drug prolongs lives of patients with a rare disease. Health headlines like these are published daily, sometimes making opposing claims. There can be a disconnect between broad, attention-grabbing headlines and the often specific, incremental results of the medical research they cover. So, how can you avoid being misled by sensational headlines? The best way to assess a headline's credibility is to examine the original research it reports on. We've created a hypothetical research scenario for each of these three headlines. Keep watching for the explanation of the first example, then pause at the headline to answer the question. These scenarios are simplified."

The experiment asks us to consider a world where scientists have developed a machine that simulates real life, guaranteeing experiences of only pleasure and never pain. The catch is that you must permanently leave reality behind, but you'll hardly notice the difference. Your experiences will be indistinguishable from reality, with life's natural ups and downs replaced by an endless series of highs. Sounds appealing, right?"

288,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"Where does all the carbon we release go? Carbon operates within a natural cycle, present in all living things: in the soil, in the oceans, in the atmosphere, and in rocks deep underground. When plants and other living things die, much of their stored carbon is released back into the atmosphere until new plants grow and reabsorb it. However, over millions of years, some of the carbon stored in ancient trees and sea life transforms into rock and fossil fuels: coal, oil, and natural gas. Natural events, such as volcanic eruptions, release some of the carbon trapped in rock. Meanwhile, human activities, like burning fossil fuels, also release prehistoric carbon. Today, humans release approximately 60 times more carbon than all the volcanoes on the planet combined each year."
289,hybrid,none,none,polish_35,speech,"Even nature's most unappealing creatures hold important secrets, but who would want a swarm of cockroaches approaching them? One of the greatest differences between natural and human technologies lies in robustness. Robust systems remain stable in complex and unfamiliar environments. Notably, cockroaches can self-stabilize while running over rough terrain. When we equipped them with a jet pack or subjected them to a perturbation like an earthquake, we found that their remarkably tuned legs allowed them to self-stabilize without relying on brainpower. They can navigate complex terrain, such as grass, with ease and remain stable. We discovered a new behavior where, due to their shape, they automatically roll onto their side to pass through a test section of artificial grass. Robust systems can perform multiple tasks with the same structure. Here's a newly discovered behavior we've observed."

And, like many 20-somethings, I expected to solve the world's problems — more specifically, the world's water problems — with technology alone. I had a lot to learn.
