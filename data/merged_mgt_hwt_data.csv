In the early 1990s, the cost of electronics was relatively low, and many people could afford to buy them. However, by the mid-1990s, the cost of electronics had risen significantly, and many people were unable to afford them. This was due in part to the rise in the cost of labor and materials, as well as the expansion of the electronics manufacturing industry. In addition, the availability of electronics has also changed since 1990.

The second factor is that there has been an increase in the number of cigarette smokers over time. This is likely due to the increase in the number of people who did not complete high school and the decreased opportunity cost of engaging in tobacco use. Because the price of cigarettes has remained relatively the same, cigarette smokers are able to continue to smoke for the same monetary value while reducing consumption.

Advancements in technology and manufacturing processes have led to lower production costs, which have been passed down to consumers through lower prices. In addition, competition in the market has increased, with many more companies producing electronics, leading to more options and lower prices. For example, in 1990, a basic cell phone would cost an average of $2,000, while today consumers can purchase a smartphone for as little as $100. Similarly, the average price of a desktop computer in 1990 was around $2,500, while today consumers can purchase a more powerful laptop for around $500.

This collection of water droplets forms what is known as a rain shower. Rain typically occurs when the sun is low in the sky, between about 5pm and 7pm local time. Typical rain droplets range from five to ten microns in size. This causes a group of rain droplets to form a circular pattern, and if enough air is moving across the surface of the earth, the rain will fall.

Branko milanovic argued in 2001 that increased inequality reduces growth, due to a negative correlation between inequality and education. Inequality is a barrier to development in three main ways. First, less prosperous groups tend to save a smaller proportion of their income than the better-off, which reduces their investments and growth prospects. Second, fewer well-off individuals have the educational skills to take advantage of new opportunities, so they are left behind and grow less fast. Third, higher inequality reduces trust and therefore cooperation.

The evidence of climate change is overwhelming, and it's becoming increasingly clear that human activity is the cause of the changes we're seeing. We need to take steps to mitigate climate change, and this includes efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions."

As a non-american blogger i've been a little reluctant to get involved in some of these discussions, particularly the bits about flags, but since i started it (the subject, not the flag-burning) i suppose i'd better say something. Firstly, i think that the idea of having a law against flag-burning is completely nuts. The moment you start according a symbol - any symbol - that kind of automatic reverence and protection, you've taken a small but important step towards totalitarianism. Symbols are kind of fickle - they don't a priori represent anything in themselves; it's what they are perceived as meaning or made to represent that's important."

382,human,none,none,none,email_content,"Sshackle.nsf as of this week enrononline has just started offering us/canadian dollar swaps online. As part of my review in determining whether a counterparty can transact these products online i look at the financial trading agreement database to see if there are any restrictions indicated, check the master swap agreement, and i am also looking at any board resolutions we might have received when we got the master agreement executed. What i am finding is that in the old days when we asked for resolutions evidencing the authority to enter into the master agreement/derivative transactions frequently the resolutions do not allow the counterparies to enter into currency transactions. Since transacting these currency transactions with our energy customers is a new area of business for us i just wanted us all to be mindful to check these old resolutions and not to rely solely on the ""restrictions"" contained in lotus notes."

You use the term dcq and you also talk about a 20% tolerance above or below the estimated quantity. Normally their would be no tolerance with a dcq transaction. 3.

398,human,none,none,none,game_review,"Being the 3rd installment in the trilogy i'll get the bad stuff out of the way first. I quite hate pre-quals as it's technically going backwards in a story and not forwards (this is an issue for every pre-qual). Granted it offers more storywise. The combat feels sloppy and doesn't feel as sharp as arkham city managed to make it. As of writing this recommendation (26/10/2013) there is a game breaking bug that stops a side mission from ever being completed (main story not effected). Some gadgets are put at a rediculous hotkey that makes your hand have to travel the whole keyboard to get to it. It might sound like nothing, but while in combat it could potentially break your combo."

The upgrade system is really balanced and once you get around it, it's not too tedious. The elemental stuff and limited ammo softly forces you to use different weapons. Lots of cool unique (being the important word here while comparing sw2 to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ borderlands' formula of 'rng' weapons) weapons that stay viable through most of the game. The music is great, especially the main theme and of course stan bush's stuff."

Why? thats a pure discrimination! and why the game does not tell me that before i create a char and not even then when i reach the skill limit after weeks of playing?!?"
401,human,none,none,none,game_review,"I think this assassin's creed nailed the mechanics down on all fronts (ship battles, sailing, hunting (fish), parkour, etc). I felt much more attached to this character as well. The story starts out extremely rough but does get much much better as you play (i think this is with every ac game personally). Edward was quite the interesting character and so was all the side characters. I felt like all the collectables actually meant something in this ac game that i never got from any of the previous ones and maybe its because i felt like they had a bigger purpose in the game. They def were not required but they were fun to get and you got rewarded in a very balanced way."
402,human,none,none,none,game_review,"While i personally cannot recommend this game, it wasn't absolutely terrible. The gunplay is alright, so long as you have the money to purchase gun parts, which would be my main complaint with this game: it's pay-to-win. If i could get past that, the game would be enjoyable, as the hardsuit is fun to use and hrv is an excellent idea. I'd take this game over any call of duty title any day, but its pay-to-win microtransanction format is off-putting for me. If you are alright with this model, then by all means, have fun. But if you're like me and dislike pay-to-win games, just let this one slide; it's not our cup of tea."
403,human,none,none,none,game_review,"While not perfect, this game has been greatly enjoyable. The save system and possibility of sudden death leads to some frustration. I'm on my first playthrough and i lost my main character around hour 10 of 20ish. Would have really liked a save to reload at that point. I've since picked up a 3rd party mod/save tool to avoid catastrophic failures. Plus the aiming reticule is on the small side and zoom is underpowered. With all that said, its been a blast. I'm not normally a zombie fan, but the combination of strategy, missions, first person shooter/beat em up is great. I've been playing it as often as i can get away... Just one more mission, just one more supply run - or i'm running away and want to get safe before shutting the game down."
404,human,none,none,none,game_review,"An absolute great stragtegy game! having played every single other wargame (european escalation, and alb), i have to say this one fits well. The number of units are great. Not sure exactly how many units there are, but there's a crap ton!!! graphics are just beautiful, sounds are great, and the gameplay overall is epic. The ingame chat box at the main menu is very entertaining as well, no i am not kidding. However, if anyone thinking this game is 'easy', or if you are new to the strategy genre, it could take you quite some time to get it nailed down. Do not get upset, you will lose a lot of units. Just make sure you plan ahead, always have anti-air, and anti-tank."

It's not cheesy (ok it's sometimes cheesy). And different story characters have all their own sense of humour. Those different characters do really have different personalities. And the level design; it's just rad. Btw i never played the first portal game. One of these days, i'm planning to if i can spare the time. I would never have played it if i hadn't played the sequel."
406,human,none,none,none,game_review,Ok lets start on the pros(+) and cons(-) then my thoughts on this game. +some of the best charecters +good story +lods of content +customisible charecter ( you can be male or female whatever you like) +you can have a relationship with most of your companions(yes fangirls you can have a love intrest) -bad graphics ( i dont think graphics really matter anyway) -weird and akward love scenes -invisible walls -theirs one mission in my opinion was boring but everyone has different tastes -+ um this isnt really bad or good but for those who care your protaginist you made cant talk okay know for my thoughts. I love this game. This game is probubly one of the best rpgs or games in general i have ever played.so if your a rpg fan you proubly already have this game.
407,human,none,none,none,game_review,"Yes, this is a nostalgia trip for thirty-somethings who remember (at least in the uk) watching the ever-irritating timmy mallet just for the five minute transformers cartoon. The voice actors for optimus, megatron, bumblebee, and many others are back, and instantly recognisable. The distinctive cartoon transformation sound is there. Graphically, the cell-shaded presentation is perfect, and very, very generation one. But aside from that, it's actually a very fun game. The combat mechanics are extremely well done. Transforming mid-fight is often a necessity, and woven seamlessly into combos, making it quite unlike high moon's excellent war for/fall of cybertron games. Another distinction is the heavy focus on melee combat, but some enemies (e.g. Seekers) require a switch to a ranged blaster."
408,human,none,none,none,game_review,"So i downloaded the game and played it for a little while, and it was nothing special. I spent more time trying to log in though than actually playing the game. There is a bug where it says that there was an update to the terms of service or whatever and whenever you clicked 'accept' it would just pop up again. You have to restart the client for it to work. Now that isn't that bad but why do i need to link my steam and gface accounts? they say it is for dlc but why is that even necessary? it is also not reversable so now i know that a company i don't care about has access to my steam information. Now the game itself is so so. It is easily recognisable as a cod clone, except somehow they made the gunplay worse... How is that even possible?"

410,human,none,none,none,game_review,"I experienced no performance problems even at release, and after all these patches it plays really well. Imo, this is a really great and fun game in truth, although the format may be somewhat annoying (where the free-roam city area repopulates with new enemies every time you progress the story). I particularly enjoyed the 'dual play' segments (where you can play batman + 1 more), and the ability to use the controller for most segments of the game but the mouse and keyboard for the tank combat segments was greatly appreciated. Driving your batmobile around the free-roam city, including when chasing the apc commanders, is actually quite enjoyable once you figure out how to use the breaks to skid around corners (and when you master that, driving around the city is really quite enjoyable!)"

But when a game overall is so great, it's easier to spot the flaws, and here they are as i saw 'em: - no sli support - wtf? i had to put the game away until i upgraded my card, as it ran too poorly on my old dual gpu gtx 590.

Gameplay is also solid, art design is beautiful, music is surprisingly high quality and appropriate, the story/world has me interested, and the puzzles are fun. But the best thing about this game beyond all that is the comedy. If you've played any rpg since the dawn of video game rpgs you will laugh at the various jokes, parodies, and references; if you've never played an rpg before then you should still enjoy the game for its humor. If you played final fantasy 7 or x you absolutely need to play this game, without giving too much away... I had to actually stop playing after 2 hours to give my cheeks a break from laughing and smiling so much. What a delight so far."
415,human,none,none,none,game_review,"I'm really sorry, i try to be supportive of free-to-play games and indie developers, but i really didn't enjoy this game. The description sounded right up my alley, but the execution has done nothing for me. I love puzzle and exploration games, but i found this game to be completely unintuitive, and even after looking up how to progress i still just simply didn't find the gameplay itself fun. It also completely lacks a pause button, or if it does have one i never found it. Considering that a lot of sequences in the game are timed, this seems like a critical oversight. I also feel like this game is a lot more cut scene than it is game, and i end up just sitting around drumming my fingers a lot."

In previous games you were set on the earth's timeline going through periods like the stone age, medieval age, and the modern age; however, in this game you are set in the future on a mission to colonize a new planet. What i enjoy about this game is 2k took a new approach to the game and added some new mechanics such as the affinity system and orbital layer. What i didn't enjoy was that with these new mechanics the game could be overwhelming at times. What think could be improved on this game is that they could maybe incorperate some new artwork in the game such as the enviroment you experience when communicating with another leader."

Edit: after playing 60+ hours i can honestly say this is one of the better more ''realistic'' zombie games. It's very much designed like a survival horror as you must save up your ammo, heal your own wounds when you bleed out, take pills when youre infected, etc. Also, i find zombies to feel very natual to be well animated for a free to play game.

No aussie servers - one red bar puts you at a severe disadvantage,and creates unbearable lag. Mind you,i played through the offline training mode and it was stuttering/lagging as well (how does that even happen?). Couple that with the poor ping,and it just ruins the game. .

420,human,none,none,none,game_review,"Very late last night i finished this. The story is not very deep or interesting but what makes it stand out is the story-telling. The atmosphere is filled to the brim and the many collectibles do a great job at fleshing it out. I did learn a lot about the world of batman so it was a little disappointing that so few bosses were in the game. Oh well, there's enough future games to rectify that. The combat is the right amount of challenge but it's more on the easy side. Leveling up batman wasn't very satisfying. It's the gadgets you upgrade and acquire during the campaign which add for nice new gameplay mechanics. Getting access to previously unreachable places makes for a nice sense of progression."

This masterpiece represents the pinnacle of storytelling in my opinion, and the soundtrack is a gorgeously charming and perfect accompaniment. Yes, the controls are a bit finicky and the gameplay is not the strong point, but the story is so fantastic that i did not care one bit.

There's quite a lot of choice in the game, with the choice of what to build to give you an advantage, what weapons to use and what power ups to have on those weapons as well as what drinks to use to give you a bonus effect. The art style and music in the game is fantastic, everything looks so colourful at times, who says the apocolypse has to be dull. Best of all, the game has narration based on what you, the player do. So if you end up picking up a weapon then switch it for another in the armoury, the narration would say something of you taking along the new weapon."
423,human,none,none,none,game_review,"I had originally bought this game in early development, when the only currency was spacebux, and there was no 'tech tree'. This was when the game was good. All of the guns at this point were equally overpowered, so there was no problems with imbalance; everyone could kill everyone at any time. Also, the game used to give you unlimited gun slots and five loadouts. You would think that for a game with 'bajillions of guns', they would at least give you more than 6 weapon slots and 3 loadouts before you have to pay to get more. At one point, i had about 3 pages worth of guns, and was planning on new ideas for more, because personally, that's where i found it fun."

In this case, the reviews reflect the fun of this neat little game. It is an odd mix between a classic 2d platformer and an moba, and does it with style. I found myself enjoying characters that i wouldn't enjoy in other moba games. I had expected this trait to continue, but decided to give a melee tank a go anyway. I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome and ended up trying out more as they were unlocked from playing games. The art style and interface is oddly charming. As such, i now use one of the characters as my avatar and a wallpaper from creating a card set for the game."

It's been awhile since a game has had that effect on me. The music sets the mood, the sound effects are right on, and the controls are perfect. I look forward to every combat, and they've optimized combat extremely well. I had my doubt about the navel combat system, but it is so much fun to lay waste to multiple fleets at a time! the only way to lose in this game is to fail to retreat. If the combat looks overwhelming just get outta there, regroup, and counter-assault. Thanks, devs, for an awesome experience!"

While fans of the original series may be upset at the change to their beloved character, it’s certainly for the better; and this new game by ninja theory proves it. Dmc serves as the perfect point for newcomers to jump into the series. It shows the origins of an arrogant, cynical dante, and it chronicles his journey from cynicism to selflessness. Throughout, the game weaves a clear, narrative arc for the new dante, making him a compelling character to watch.image the story follows dante as he’s introduced into the corrupt world he willfully chose to ignore."

It has so much detail put into it, and it is a bundle of happiness, bad puns, annoying dogs, secrets. It is serious when it needs to be, but isn't a stranger to funny moments. The character design is on point, with there being various characters with various personailities and secrets to them. It sticks out from other rpg's because you don't have to kill anyone, which is an unused concept in rpg's.

Half the story relies on shock factor. I was not shocked nor emotionally moved in any way by this. Maybe i'm desensitized, or maybe it was too simple to warrant a reaction out of me. As for the other half of the game, it tries to paint a picture (literally) of a person in mental decline. It deals with obsession, hallucination, depression and a few other things. In theory it is a cool idea. But the 'game' took me 10 minutes to complete, and that is with reading and taking in every little bit of information i could."

There is a fairly steep learning curve to the game's mechanics of which i am still trying to learn; however, this breadth of strategy allows you a myriad of ways to reach goals and take advantage of certain situations.

After those few enjoyable hours you'll begin to see that the only thing left the game has to offer is repetition in it's combat, enemies and game play. The one major high point for the game is that the developers are working hard and do semi-frequent updates that generally include a lot of content from sweeping changes to some of the game's systems, new warframes and other tweaks/features. It's a good game to play casually. Though i doubt it will hold your attention beyond a few months unless you just really like grinding.

But the gameplay isn't as smooth as it could be, the levels not inventive and what is in it is a surreal horror show.

In addition to coaxing ever larger and more tangible objects into a regime of quantum behavior, this new capability has encouraged ideas of using mechanical oscillators in the processing and communication of quantum information and as precision force sensors operating beyond the standard quantum limit. But the effectively linear interaction between motion and light or electricity precludes access to the broader class of quantum states of motion, such as cat states or energy squeezed states. Indeed, early optomechanical proposals noted the possibility to escape this restriction by creating strong quadratic coupling of motion to light. Although there have been experimental demonstrations of quadratically coupled optomechanical systems, these have not yet accessed nonclassical states of motion."

Spamming strategies are hard to capture, as they can be varying quickly along time, different across spammers and target products, and more critically, remained unknown in most cases. Furthermore, most existing detectors focus on detection accuracy, which is not well-aligned with the goal of maintaining the trustworthiness of product evaluations. To address the challenges, we formulate a minimax game where the spammers and spam detectors compete with each other on their practical goals that are not solely based on detection accuracy. Nash equilibria of the game lead to stable detectors that are agnostic to any mixed detection strategies."

Among this family, we identify a tracking solution with a single parameter to control simultaneously the fidelity of the transfer, the population of the excited state, and robustness. We define a measure of the robustness of an uh-fidelity transfer as the minimum percentile deviation on the pulse areas at which the infidelity rises above $10^{-4}$. The robustness of our shaped pulses is found superior to that of gaussian and adiabatically-optimized pulses for moderate pulse areas."

We show that all local minima share the same form of structure that partially identifies the component centers of the true mixture, in the sense that each local minimum involves a non-overlapping combination of fitting multiple gaussians to a single true component and fitting a single gaussian to multiple true components. Our results apply to the setting where the true mixture components satisfy a certain separation condition, and are valid even when the number of components is over-or under-specified. For gaussian mixtures with three components, we obtain sharper results in terms of the scaling with the separation between the components."

In this hybrid model, a strategy of metabolic energy minimization is combined in a race process, with a non-linear description of the movement of the mass center's libration, trying to reproduce the behavior of the walk-run transition. The results of the experimental data, for different speed regimes, indicate that the perimeter of the trajectory of the mass center is a relevant quantity in the quantification of this dynamic. An experimental procedure was put into practice in collaboration with the research group in biomedical engineering, basic sciences and laboratories of the manuela beltr\'an university in bogot\'a, colombia."
506,human,none,none,none,paper_abstract,"We present a new mixed variable symplectic (mvs) integrator for planetary systems, that fully resolve close encounters. The method is based on a time regularisation that allows keeping the stability properties of the symplectic integrators, while also reducing the effective step size whenever two planets encounter. We use a high order mvs scheme such that it is possible to integrate with large time steps far away from close encounters. We show that this algorithm is able to resolve almost exact collisions (i.e with a mutual separation of a fraction of the physical radius) while using the same time-step as in weakly perturbed problem such as the solar system. We demonstrate the long term behaviour on systems of six super-earths experiencing strong scattering for 50 kyr. We compare our algorithm to hybrid methods such as mercury and show that for an equivalent cost we obtain much better energy conservation."
507,human,none,none,none,paper_abstract,"Entanglement is a key resource for quantum information processing. A widely used tool for detecting entanglement is entanglement witness, where the measurement of the witness operator is guaranteed to be positive for all separable states and can be negative for certain entangled states. In reality, due to the exponentially increasing the hilbert-space dimension with respective to the system size, it is very challenging to construct an efficient entanglement witness for general multipartite entangled states. For $n$-partite greenberger-horne-zeilinger (ghz)-like states, the most robust witness scheme requires $n+1$ local measurement settings and can tolerate up to $1/2$ white noise. As a comparison, the most efficient witness for ghz-like states only needs two local measurement settings and can tolerate up to $1/3$ white noise."
508,human,none,none,none,paper_abstract,"Within general relativity, the unique stationary solution of an isolated black hole is the kerr spacetime, which has a peculiar multipolar structure depending only on its mass and spin. We develop a general method to extract the multipole moments of arbitrary stationary spacetimes and apply it to a large family of horizonless microstate geometries. The latter can break the axial and equatorial symmetry of the kerr metric and have a much richer multipolar structure, which provides a portal to constrain fuzzball models phenomenologically. We find numerical evidence that all multipole moments are typically larger (in absolute value) than those of a kerr black hole with the same mass and spin. Current measurements of the quadrupole moment of black-hole candidates could place only mild constraints on fuzzballs, while future gravitational-wave detections of extreme mass-ratio inspirals with the space mission lisa will improve these bounds by orders of magnitude."
509,human,none,none,none,paper_abstract,"Reasoning about graphs evolving over time is a challenging concept in many domains, such as bioinformatics, physics, and social networks. We consider a common case in which edges can be short term interactions (e.g., messaging) or long term structural connections (e.g., friendship). In practice, long term edges are often specified by humans. Human-specified edges can be both expensive to produce and suboptimal for the downstream task. To alleviate these issues, we propose a model based on temporal point processes and variational autoencoders that learns to infer temporal attention between nodes by observing node communication. As temporal attention drives between-node feature propagation, using the dynamics of node interactions to learn this key component provides more flexibility while simultaneously avoiding issues associated with human-specified edges."

The pcw consists of two parallel nanobeams with a 240 nm vacuum gap between the beams. Models are developed and validated for the transduction of beam motion to phase and amplitude modulation of a weak optical probe propagating in a guided mode (gm) of the pcw for probe frequencies far from and near to the dielectric band edge. Since our pcw has been designed for near-field atom trapping, this research provides a foundation for evaluating possible deleterious effects of thermal motion on optical atomic traps near the surfaces of pcws. Longer term goals are to achieve strong atom-mediated links between individual phonons of vibration and single photons propagating in the gms of the pcw, thereby enabling opto-mechanics at the quantum level with atoms, photons, and phonons."

In particular, the restriction homomorphisms between the orthogonal, unitary and symplectic groups of adjacent dimensions are naturally split epimorphisms. The interest in the splitting comes from equivariant stable homotopy theory. The equivariant stable homotopy groups of every global spectrum form a global mackey functor, so the splittings imply that certain long exact homotopy group sequences separate into short exact sequences. For the real and complex global thom spectra $\mathbf{mo}$ and $\mathbf{mu}$, the splittings imply the regularity of various euler classes related to the tautological representations of $o(n)$ and $u(n)$."

In this paper, we present our approach to designing an open-source neural network to classify audio segments into vocalizations produced by the child wearing the recording device, vocalizations produced by other children, adult male speech, and adult female speech.

514,human,none,none,none,paper_abstract,"Density-based clustering relies on the idea of linking groups to some specific features of the probability distribution underlying the data. The reference to a true, yet unknown, population structure allows to frame the clustering problem in a standard inferential setting, where the concept of ideal population clustering is defined as the partition induced by the true density function. The nonparametric formulation of this approach, known as modal clustering, draws a correspondence between the groups and the domains of attraction of the density modes. Operationally, a nonparametric density estimate is required and a proper selection of the amount of smoothing, governing the shape of the density and hence possibly the modal structure, is crucial to identify the final partition. In this work, we address the issue of density estimation for modal clustering from an asymptotic perspective."
515,human,none,none,none,paper_abstract,"The tails of diboson production at the lhc are sensitive to the interference between standard model and higher dimension operators parameterizing the effects of heavy new physics. However, helicity selection rules for the diboson scattering amplitudes set an obstruction to the na\""ive interference contributions of dimension six operators, causing the total diboson rate correction's leading contribution to cancel. In this case, carefully measuring the azimuthal decay angles ""resurrects"" the interference, recouping sensitivity to the ""non-interfering"" operators. We explore these signatures in detail, and find that the eft uncertainties associated with higher-dimensional operators are uniquely well-suppressed by the construction of an asymmetry variable which is only generated by these non-interfering operators, relegating the effects of higher-dimensional, interfering operators to the same status as statistical errors in this observable."
516,human,none,none,none,paper_abstract,"Causal inference from observational data is the goal of many data analyses in the health and social sciences. However, academic statistics has often frowned upon data analyses with a causal objective. The introduction of the term ""data science"" provides a historic opportunity to redefine data analysis in such a way that it naturally accommodates causal inference from observational data. Like others before, we organize the scientific contributions of data science into three classes of tasks: description, prediction, and counterfactual prediction (which includes causal inference). An explicit classification of data science tasks is necessary to discuss the data, assumptions, and analytics required to successfully accomplish each task. We argue that a failure to adequately describe the role of subject-matter expert knowledge in data analysis is a source of widespread misunderstandings about data science."
517,human,none,none,none,paper_abstract,"The weak gravity conjecture (wgc) demands the existence of superextremal particles in any consistent quantum theory of gravity. The standard lore is that these particles are introduced to ensure that extremal black holes are either unstable or marginally stable, but it is not clear what is wrong if this doesn't happen. This note shows that, for a generic einstein quantum theory of gravity in ads, exactly stability of extremal black branes is in tension with rigorously proven quantum information theorems about entanglement entropy. Avoiding the contradiction leads to a nonperturbative version of the wgc, which reduces to the usual statement at weak coupling. The argument is general, and it does not rely on either supersymmetry or a particular uv completion, assuming only the validity of einsteinian gravity, effective field theory, and holography."
518,human,none,none,none,paper_abstract,"Understanding how strongly correlated two-dimensional (2d) systems can give rise to unconventional superconductivity with high critical temperatures is one of the major unsolved problems in condensed matter physics. Ultracold 2d fermi gases have emerged as clean and controllable model systems to study the interplay of strong correlations and reduced dimensionality, but direct evidence of superfluidity in these systems has been missing. Here, we demonstrate superfluidity in an ultracold 2d fermi gas by moving a periodic potential through the system and observing no dissipation below a critical velocity v$_{\rm c}$. We measure v$_{\rm c}$ as a function of interaction strength and find a maximum in the crossover regime between bosonic and fermionic superfluidity. Our measurement establishes ultracold fermi gases as a powerful tool for studying the influence of reduced dimensionality on strongly correlated superfluids."

Despite ode's wide usage in modeling, frequent absence of their analytic solutions makes it difficult to estimate ode parameters from the data, especially when the model has lots of variables and parameters. This paper proposes a bayesian ode parameter estimating algorithm which is fast and accurate even for models with many parameters. The proposed method approximates an ode model with a state-space model based on equations of a numeric solver. It allows fast estimation by avoiding computations of a whole numerical solution in the likelihood.

We find that the differential conductance and induced pairing amplitudes strongly depend on the angle between the junction direction in real space and the axis separating the weyl nodes in momentum space. We identify the influence of a chiral chemical potential, i.e., the electron population imbalance between weyl nodes of opposite chirality, on the transport characteristics of the junction. Remarkably, we observe a net spin polarization of cooper pairs that are generated via andreev reflection in the two wsm regions. The spin polarization is opposite in the two wsm regions and highly sensitive to the chirality imbalance and excitation energy."
521,human,none,none,none,paper_abstract,"Metal ion implantation into ceramics has been demonstrated to be an effective and controllable technique for tailoring the surface electrical conductivity of the ceramic piece, and this approach has been used in a number of applications. Importantly, it provides a method for grading the voltage drop across high voltage insulators, and thereby increasing the maximum operational voltage that can be applied across the insulator without surface flashover. However a concern for the use of the method is the long term stability of the implantation-induced conductivity, this especially so if the implanted metal species is readily oxidized. Here we report on our examination of the long-term behavior of the surface conductivity of titanium-implanted alumina. The results indicate that after an initial drop of as much as 40% in the first few weeks after implantation, the conductivity shows only a very slow decrease of about 10% over the following year."

The associated charge is equivalent to the skyrmion charge for any smooth configuration. In addition, there exist singular configurations that can be identified as n_f=1 baryons charged under the new symmetry. Under this identification, the vector mesons play the role of the chern-simons vector fields living on the quantum hall droplet that forms the n_f=1 baryon. We propose that this current is the correct effective expression for the baryon current at low energies. This proposal gives a unified picture for the two types of baryons and allows them to continuously transform one to the other in a natural way. In addition, chern-simons dualities on the droplet can be interpreted as a result of seiberg-like duality between gluons and vector mesons."

Transverse momentum-dependent skew tunneling of cooper pairs through the spin-active ferromagnetic insulator interface creates sizable transverse hall supercurrents, to which we refer as anomalous josephson hall effect currents. We generalize the furusaki-tsukada formula, which got initially established to quantify usual (tunneling) josephson current flows, to evaluate the transverse current components and demonstrate that their amplitudes are widely adjustable by means of the spin-orbit coupling strengths or the superconducting phase difference across the junction. As a clear spectroscopic fingerprint of josephson junctions, well-localized subgap bound states form around the interface."

Of turbul. 2020), that dipoles are as important to the dynamics of decaying two-dimensional turbulence as individual vortex cores, it is found that the kinetic energy of this flow is carried by elongated streams formed by the concatenation of dipoles. Vortices separate into a family of small fast-moving cores, and another family of larger slowly moving ones, which can be described as `frozen' into a slowly evolving `crystal'. The kinematics of both families are very different, and only the former is self-similar. The latter is responsible for most of the kinetic energy of the flow, and its vortices form the dipoles and the streams. Mechanisms are discussed for the growth of this slow component."

In particular, we apply our techniques to the glued-trees problem, improving their hitting time upper bound by a polynomial factor: from $o(n^5)$ to $o(n^2\log n)$.

In this letter, we highlight an alternative emri formation channel: (wet) emri formation assisted by the accretion flow around accreting galactic-center massive black holes (mbhs). In this channel, the accretion disk captures stellar-mass black holes that are intially moving on inclined orbits, and subsequently drives them to migrate towards the mbh - this process boosts the formation rate of emris in such galaxies by orders of magnitude."

This, however, often results in a challenging nonlinear problem, for which the optimal solution is infeasible to implement. To this end, we propose a deep fully convolutional neural network, deeprx, which executes the whole receiver pipeline from frequency domain signal stream to uncoded bits in a 5g-compliant fashion.

529,human,none,none,none,paper_abstract,"Mutation-based fuzzing typically uses an initial set of non-crashing seed inputs (a corpus) from which to generate new inputs by mutation. A corpus of potential seeds will often contain thousands of similar inputs. This lack of diversity can lead to wasted fuzzing effort by exhaustive mutation from all available seeds. To address this, fuzzers come with distillation tools (e.g., afl-cmin) that select the smallest subset of seeds that triggers the same range of instrumentation data points as the full corpus. Common practice suggests that minimizing the number and cumulative size of the seeds leads to more efficient fuzzing, which we explore systematically. We present results of 34+ cpu-years of fuzzing with five distillation approaches to understand their impact in finding bugs in real-world software."

The scalable supervisor under partial observation does not need to be recomputed regardless of how many agents are added to or removed from the system.

Moreover, this approach uses, for the first time in the field of enf, a temporal window, not necessarily the rectangular one, at the stage preceding spectral estimation. Krylov matrices are employed for fast implementation of matrix inversions.

We used a differential excitation protocol to extract the high spatial frequency information. By modulating the excitation laser's power, the spatial resolution of imaging was improved approximate 1.6 times in comparison with the confocal microscopy.

We contrast our approach with frequentist methods that rely on numerical integration to reveal that only the bayesian method achieves both unbiased estimation with respect to the sampling design distribution and consistency with respect to the population generating distribution. Our simulations and real data example for a survey of business establishments demonstrate the utility of our approach across different modeling formulations and sampling designs.

In a minor modification of this scenario, narrower belts can arise if the planetesimals are initially eccentric, which could result from earlier planet perturbations during the gas-rich protoplanetary disc phase. However, a primordial eccentricity could alternatively be caused by instabilities that increase the disc eccentricity, without the need for any planets."

We demonstrate analytically that the few-get-richer effect emerges when people tend to click on top-ranked items and have heterogeneous preferences for the classes of items.

With carefully designed patterns, the proposed pruning unprecedentedly and consistently achieves accuracy enhancement and better feature extraction ability on different dnn structures and datasets, and our pattern-aware pruning framework also achieves pattern library extraction, pattern selection, pattern and connectivity pruning and weight training simultaneously.

This can be done by means of visual predictive checks (vpc), which consist of (1) several reproductions of the original study by simulation from the model under evaluation, (2) calculating estimates of interest for each simulated study and (3) comparing the distribution of those estimates with the estimate from the original study. This procedure is a generic method that is straightforward to apply, in general. Here we consider the application of the method to time to event data and consider the special case when a time-varying covariate is not known or cannot be approximated after event time."
548,human,none,none,none,paper_abstract,"Novel concepts, perspectives and challenges in measuring and controlling an open quantum system via sequential schemes are shown. We discuss how similar protocols, relying both on repeated quantum measurements and dynamical decoupling control pulses, can allow to: (i) confine and protect quantum dynamics from decoherence in accordance with the zeno physics. (ii) analytically predict the probability that a quantum system is transferred into a target quantum state by means of stochastic sequential measurements. (iii) optimally reconstruct the spectral density of environmental noise sources by orthogonalizing in the frequency domain the filter functions driving the designed quantum-sensor. The achievement of these tasks will enhance our capability to observe and manipulate open quantum systems, thus bringing advances to quantum science and technologies."

591,human,none,none,none,speech,"If you ask people about what part of psychology do they think is hard, and you say, ""well, what about thinking and emotions?"" most people will say, ""emotions are terribly hard. They're incredibly complex. They can't — i have no idea of how they work. But thinking is really very straightforward: it's just sort of some kind of logical reasoning, or something. But that's not the hard part. ""so here's a list of problems that come up. One nice problem is, what do we do about health? the other day, i was reading something, and the person said probably the largest single cause of disease is handshaking in the west."

Many parents face tough questions and tough decisions. Shall we tell our child about the sperm donation? if so, when? what words to use? sperm donors are often referred to as ""biological fathers,"" but should we really be using the word ""father? ""as a philosopher and social scientist, i have been studying these questions about the concept of parenthood. But today, i will talk to you about what i learned from talking to parents and children. I will show you that they know what matters most in a family, even though their family looks a little different."
593,human,none,none,none,speech,"When i look in the mirror today, i see a justice and education scholar at columbia university, a youth mentor, an activist and a future new york state senator. (cheering)i see all of that and a man who spent a quarter of his life in state prison — six years, to be exact, starting as a teenager on rikers island for an act that nearly cost a man his life. But what got me from there to here wasn't the punishment i faced as a teenager in adult prison or the harshness of our legal system. Instead, it was a learning environment of a classroom that introduced me to something i didn't think was possible for me or our justice system as a whole.a few weeks before my release on parole, a counselor encouraged me to enroll in a new college course being offered in the prison."

Or just an airport security line delay. That one's actually true. (laughter)if some of your perceptions were negative, i don't really blame you. That's just how the media has been portraying people who look like me. One study found that 80 percent of news coverage about islam and muslims is negative. And studies show that americans say that most don't know a muslim. I guess people don't talk to their uber drivers. (laughter)well, for those of you who have never met a muslim, it's great to meet you."
595,human,none,none,none,speech,"We need to build a weather service for water. Yet, until we collectively demand accountability, the incentives to fund it will not exist.the first time i spoke at a conference was here at ted, eight years ago. Fresh out of grad school, little did i know that in those few minutes onstage, i was framing the questions i was going to be asked for the next decade. And, like too many 20-somethings, i expected to solve the world's problems — more specifically, the world's water problems — with my technology. I had a lot to learn.it was seductive, believing that our biggest water quality problems persist because they're so hard to identify. And i presumed that we just needed simpler, faster and more affordable sensors. I was wrong."
596,human,none,none,none,speech,"Indeed, for 20 years, i worked in finance. I knew everything about finance, for sure. I knew the global economy because it was my life. All the topics that you could bring up about ecology, the end of the world, etc., that i knew like the back of my hand i didn't really believe in them. In 2007, an extremely unusual event occurred, you may remember, the subprime crisis, the collapse of big american banks. It was an electric shock. I had a fair few stormy conversations with my wife about the matter, about my job, on the limits of the model. Besides the crisis, i realized that i was completely wrong, that we were heading for disaster."
597,human,none,none,none,speech,"So, i'll be speaking to you using language ... Because i can. This is one these magical abilities that we humans have. We can transmit really complicated thoughts to one another. So what i'm doing right now is, i'm making sounds with my mouth as i'm exhaling. I'm making tones and hisses and puffs, and those are creating air vibrations in the air. Those air vibrations are traveling to you, they're hitting your eardrums, and then your brain takes those vibrations from your eardrums and transforms them into thoughts. I hope. (laughter)i hope that's happening. So because of this ability, we humans are able to transmit our ideas across vast reaches of space and time. We're able to transmit knowledge across minds."
598,human,none,none,none,speech,"There's this quote by activist and punk rock musician jello biafra that i love. He says, ""don't hate the media. Be the media."" i'm an artist. I like working with media and technology because a, i'm familiar with them and i like the power they hold. And b, i hate them and i'm terrified of the power they hold. (laughter)i remember watching, in 2003, an interview between fox news host tony snow and then-us defense secretary, donald rumsfeld. They were talking about the recent invasion of iraq, and rumsfeld is asked the question, ""well, we're hear about our body counts, but we never hear about theirs, why?"" and rumsfeld's answer is, ""well, we don't do body counts on other people."""

The other thing to think of is what an honor it is, as a politician, to give a ted talk, particularly here in the u.k., where the reputation of politics, with the expenses scandal, has sunk so low.there was even a story recently that scientists had thought about actually replacing rats in their experiments with politicians. And someone asked,""why?"" and they said, ""well, there's no shortage of politicians, no one really minds what happens to them and, after all, there are some things that rats just won't do.""
