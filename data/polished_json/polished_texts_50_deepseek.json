This note demonstrates that, for a generic Einstein quantum theory of gravity in AdS, exact stability of extremal black branes conflicts with rigorously proven quantum information theorems about entanglement entropy. Resolving this contradiction yields a nonperturbative version of the WGC, which simplifies to the standard form at weak coupling. The argument is broadly applicable, independent of supersymmetry or specific UV completions, relying only on Einsteinian gravity, effective field theory, and holography.",

The term \"side hustle\" just seems to fit with this ethos where people are putting together a few different things to make a living.the word \"side hustle\" has its roots in popular african american newspapers. In the 1920s, these papers used the word \"hustle\" to refer to some kind of scam. By the 1950s, they were using \"side hustle\" to refer to legitimate work, too. A side hustle is a little different than a second job. A second job is about necessity.",

[The way we work] Around 15% of American workers don't hold traditional full-time jobs\u2014they're part-time, contract workers, or temps. The term 'side hustle' aligns with this ethos, where people combine multiple ventures to earn a living. The phrase 'side hustle' originated in popular African American newspapers. In the 1920s, 'hustle' described scams, but by the 1950s, 'side hustle' also meant legitimate work.
