It was a 30-minute or so walk. We were all catching our breaths. Whew! But we made it. The water was icy cold. You can feel your body getting numb because of the coldness. We only stayed less than an hour because we headed for the nearby waterfalls. Another 30 minutes of trekking. But the trip was worth it because the falls looked calming and the whole scene is indeed breathtaking. It's like you can hear yourself being one with nature. Soaking myself in the cold water was like communing with mother earth. The cold air and water were enough to make you be lulled to sleep.\"  \n\n(Changes made: \"co-employees\" \u2192 \"co-workers,\" \"guintubdan\" \u2192 \"Guintubdan,\" \"la carolota\" \u2192 \"La Carlota,\" \"for the falls\" \u2192 \"to the falls,\" \"chilly ice\" \u2192 \"icy cold,\" \"Its\" \u2192 \"It's\")",

The deadline marks the point at which fiat will gain the right to sell its car division to gm, part of an alliance agreed in 2000. Gm, whose own european operations are losing money, no longer wants to own the unprofitable fiat unit. Reports of deadlocked talks sent fiat shares down 1.2% on tuesday, after monday's 4% gain on hopes of a payoff. The us firm is thought to be offering about $2bn (\u00a31.06bn) to extricate itself from the arrangement. It has argued the deal was voided by fiat's decision to sell off fiat's finance arm and halve gm's stake via a capital-raising effort. The 2000 deal resulted from a race between gm and daimlerchrysler to ally with fiat.",

The deadline marks the point at which Fiat will gain the right to sell its car division to GM, part of an alliance agreed in 2000. GM, whose own European operations are losing money, no longer wants to own the unprofitable Fiat unit. Reports of deadlocked talks sent Fiat shares down 1.2% on Tuesday, after Monday's 4% gain on hopes of a payoff.
