The moment you start according a symbol - any symbol - that kind of automatic reverence and protection, you've taken a small but important step towards totalitarianism.

The combat feels sloppy and doesn't feel as sharp as arkham city managed to make it. As of writing this recommendation (26/10/2013) there is a game breaking bug that stops a side mission from ever being completed (main story not effected).

I particularly enjoyed the 'dual play' segments (where you can play batman + 1 more), and the ability to use the controller for most segments of the game but the mouse and keyboard for the tank combat segments was greatly appreciated. Driving your batmobile around the free-roam city, including when chasing the apc commanders, is actually quite enjoyable once you figure out how to use the breaks to skid around corners (and when you master that, driving around the city is really quite enjoyable!)",

However, most pruning techniques trade model accuracy for regularity, resulting in compromised inference accuracy and limited on-device acceleration. To address this, we introduce pattern-based sparsity\u2014a new dimension combining pattern and connectivity sparsity\u2014delivering both high accuracy and hardware efficiency. Through carefully designed patterns, our pruning method consistently enhances accuracy and improves feature extraction across diverse DNN architectures and datasets. Our framework simultaneously handles pattern library extraction, selection, pruning, and weight training. This approach naturally aligns with compiler optimizations, enabling efficient DNN execution on mobile platforms.",

In the center of this cloud, our sun formed and ignited. Along with that, what we now know as planets, comets and asteroids formed. What then happened, according to theory, is that when the earth had cooled down a bit after its formation, comets massively impacted the earth and delivered water to earth.
