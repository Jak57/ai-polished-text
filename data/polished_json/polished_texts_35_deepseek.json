The combat feels sloppy and doesn't feel as sharp as arkham city managed to make it. As of writing this recommendation (26/10/2013) there is a game breaking bug that stops a side mission from ever being completed (main story not effected). Some gadgets are put at a rediculous hotkey that makes your hand have to travel the whole keyboard to get to it.

As of this review (26/10/2013), a game-breaking bug prevents completing a side mission (though the main story is unaffected).

The voice actors for optimus, megatron, bumblebee, and many others are back, and instantly recognisable. The distinctive cartoon transformation sound is there. Graphically, the cell-shaded presentation is perfect, and very, very generation one. But aside from that, it's actually a very fun game. The combat mechanics are extremely well done. Transforming mid-fight is often a necessity, and woven seamlessly into combos, making it quite unlike high moon's excellent war for/fall of cybertron games. Another distinction is the heavy focus on melee combat, but some enemies (e.g. Seekers) require a switch to a ranged blaster.",

So if you end up picking up a weapon then switch it for another in the armoury, the narration would say something of you taking along the new weapon.",

In addition to coaxing ever larger and more tangible objects into a regime of quantum behavior, this new capability has encouraged ideas of using mechanical oscillators in the processing and communication of quantum information and as precision force sensors operating beyond the standard quantum limit. But the effectively linear interaction between motion and light or electricity precludes access to the broader class of quantum states of motion, such as cat states or energy squeezed states. Indeed, early optomechanical proposals noted the possibility to escape this restriction by creating strong quadratic coupling of motion to light.
