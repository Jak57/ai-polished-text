        "polished": "Warframe is a fun game for the first few hours of play. After those enjoyable initial hours, you'll notice the only thing left is repetitive combat, enemies, and gameplay. The standout feature is the developers' dedication, with semi-frequent updates that often introduce sweeping system changes, new warframes, and additional tweaks. It's a great casual game, though it may not hold your attention beyond a few months unless you enjoy grinding. The best part is that it's free, so I'd recommend giving it a try. If you're looking for a quick fix, it's worth exploring.\"  \n\n(46 words edited)",

However, most of the pruning techniques are essentially trade-offs between model accuracy and regularity which lead to impaired inference accuracy and limited on-device acceleration performance. To solve the problem, we introduce a new sparsity dimension, namely pattern-based sparsity that comprises pattern and connectivity sparsity, and becoming both highly accurate and hardware friendly. With carefully designed patterns, the proposed pruning unprecedentedly and consistently achieves accuracy enhancement and better feature extraction ability on different dnn structures and datasets, and our pattern-aware pruning framework also achieves pattern library extraction, pattern selection, pattern and connectivity pruning and weight training simultaneously. Our approach on the new pattern-based sparsity naturally fits into compiler optimization for highly efficient dnn execution on mobile platforms.",
