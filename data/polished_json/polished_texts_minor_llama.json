The combat feels sloppy and doesn't feel as sharp as arkham city managed to make it. As of writing this recommendation (26/10/2013) there is a game breaking bug that stops a side mission from ever being completed (main story not effected).

The positives include some of the best characters, a good story, a vast amount of content, customizable characters (you can choose to play as male or female), and the ability to form relationships with most companions, including romantic interests. On the negative side, the graphics are subpar, although I personally don't think they're a major issue. Additionally, some of the love scenes can be awkward and feel out of place, and there are instances of invisible walls and a somewhat dull mission that may not resonate with everyone. One aspect that's neither good nor bad is the inability of your protagonist to speak, which may be a consideration for some players. In my opinion, I thoroughly enjoy this game.

        "polished": "4K+ at 60fps (GTX 970) and dual audio options, along with Neptune Gear, make for a fantastic experience. What's not to love? (Check out the excellent port in this YouTube video  https //www.youtube.com/watch?v=nygsb617tmo.) This game is a great entry point for newcomers to the series. Keep in mind that there is some (skippable) dialogue. As usual, I recommend using a gamepad, but I had no issues with a keyboard-mouse setup, which is fully rebindable. The price is reasonable, and I wouldn't have been disappointed with a purchase. Plus, more than half the DLC is included for free, providing plenty to play with. I highly recommend this game to JRPG, anime, and visual novel fans, as long as you're comfortable with occasional breaks between action sequences. Cheers.

Imo, this is a really great and fun game in truth, although the format may be somewhat annoying (where the free-roam city area repopulates with new enemies every time you progress the story). I particularly enjoyed the 'dual play' segments (where you can play batman + 1 more), and the ability to use the controller for most segments of the game but the mouse and keyboard for the tank combat segments was greatly appreciated. Driving your batmobile around the free-roam city, including when chasing the apc commanders, is actually quite enjoyable once you figure out how to use the breaks to skid around corners (and when you master that, driving around the city is really quite enjoyable!)",

The character design is on point, with there being various characters with various personailities and secrets to them. It sticks out from other rpg's because you don't have to kill anyone, which is an unused concept in rpg's.

Other winners included Catalina Sandino Moreno, who took home the best actress award for her powerful performance as a drug smuggler in the Colombian drama 'Maria Full of Grace.' Moreno is also nominated for best actress at the Oscars. The best first screenplay award went to Joshua Marston for 'Maria Full of Grace'.",

Unfortunately, these evaluations can be manipulated by professional spammers using fake reviews, also known as \"spams,\" which have become increasingly sophisticated and cunning. Spammers have learned to adapt to deployed detectors, making it challenging to capture their tactics. These strategies can change rapidly over time, vary across different spammers and target products, and often remain unknown to most detectors. Moreover, most existing detectors prioritize detection accuracy, which is not necessarily aligned with the goal of maintaining the trustworthiness of product reviews. To address these challenges, we propose a minimax game where spammers and spam detectors compete with each other on their practical goals that are not solely focused on detection accuracy. The Nash equilibrium of this game leads to stable detectors that are agnostic to any mixed detection strategies.",

As a corollary, regularized regression estimators based on these reduced dimension spaces are provided as well, ranging from classical principal component regression to sparse partial robust M regression. The package also contains a set of classical and robust pre-processing utilities, including generalized spatial signs, as well as dedicated plotting functionality and cross-validation utilities. Finally, direpack has been written consistently with the scikit-learn API, such that the estimators can seamlessly be integrated into (statistical and/or machine) learning pipelines within that framework.",

We used a differential excitation protocol to extract the high spatial frequency information. By modulating the excitation laser's power, the spatial resolution of imaging was improved approximate 1.6 times in comparison with the confocal microscopy.

We discuss how similar protocols, relying on both repeated quantum measurements and dynamic decoupling control pulses, can enable  (i) confining and protecting quantum dynamics in accordance with the zero-point physics. (ii) analytically predicting the probability that a quantum system is transferred into a target quantum state by means of stochastic sequential measurements.

In fact, doing multiple tasks simultaneously can be beneficial for complex activities, such as multitasking, which is a crucial aspect of modern life.

All the topics that you could bring up about ecology, the end of the world, etc., that i knew like the back of my hand i didn't really believe in them. In 2007, an extremely unusual event occurred, you may remember, the subprime crisis, the collapse of big american banks. It was an electric shock. I had a fair few stormy conversations with my wife about the matter, about my job, on the limits of the model. Besides the crisis, i realized that i was completely wrong, that we were heading for disaster.",
        "polished": "In the finance industry, I have spent 20 years of my career, gaining an intimate understanding of the field. I was well-versed in all aspects of finance, and I had a deep appreciation for the global economy, which was my life's work. While I was knowledgeable about various topics, including ecology and the potential end of the world, I didn't fully subscribe to these concepts, as I didn't find them entirely convincing. In 2007, the global financial system was dealt a severe blow with the subprime crisis and the collapse of several major American banks. This event was a wake-up call, and I had several intense discussions with my wife about the limitations of the financial models I had been using. Ultimately, I came to realize that my previous perspectives were misguided, and we were headed for disaster.",
