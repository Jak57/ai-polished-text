This allows services to sell unit contingent energy as hourly firm since BPA is supplying reserves for up to 60 minutes. If Grays Harbor Paper notifies RT of a unit derate or outage, RT should notify BPA dispatch immediately and make the reduction in the schedule during the next ramp. For example, should the Grays unit trip at 13:33, RT would notify BPA and the sink that across the top of the hour at 14:00, the schedule would be taken to zero for the 14:00 hour. The bottom line is that 60 minutes is the maximum time BPA will carry the schedule.",

The voice actors for optimus, megatron, bumblebee, and many others are back, and instantly recognisable. The distinctive cartoon transformation sound is there. Graphically, the cell-shaded presentation is perfect, and very, very generation one. But aside from that, it's actually a very fun game. The combat mechanics are extremely well done. Transforming mid-fight is often a necessity, and woven seamlessly into combos, making it quite unlike high moon's excellent war for/fall of cybertron games. Another distinction is the heavy focus on melee combat, but some enemies (e.g. Seekers) require a switch to a ranged blaster.",

There's quite a lot of choice in the game, including decisions on what to build to gain an advantage, which weapons to use, and what power-ups to apply to those weapons, as well as what drinks to use for a bonus effect. The art style and music in the game are fantastic; everything looks so colorful at times\u2014who says the apocalypse has to be dull? Best of all, the game features narration based on what you, the player, do. So if you pick up a weapon and then switch it for another in the armory, the narration would comment on your choice of the new weapon.",

Also, the game used to give you unlimited gun slots and five loadouts.

Some keys are hard-coded and cannot be rebound. Bugs abound. My Pip-Boy disappeared permanently at one point, and I had to research console commands to retrieve it. You don't have to work for power armor; it's basically given to you from the beginning, and power cores are abundant in traders' shops. The value of power armor is greatly diminished compared to previous Fallout games. The story is mediocre; everything about this game is mediocre, except it doesn't crash every 10 minutes like Fallout 3. It's very stable compared to Fallout 3. Is it better than Fallout 3?

A 1$\\times$1 $\\mu m^2$ diode measures energy deposition by a single charged particle in the depletion region, and the array design provides a large detection area of 512$\\times$512 $\\mu m^2$. Instead of sensing the voltage drop caused by radiation, the proposed system measures the pulse width, i.e., the time it takes for the voltage to return to its baseline. This obviates the need for using power-hungry and large analog-to-digital converters. A prototype ASIC is fabricated using the TSMC 65 nm LP CMOS process and consumes an average static power of 0.535 mW under a 1.2 V analog and digital power supply. The functionality of the whole system is successfully verified in a clinical 67.5 MeV proton beam setting.",

The nonparametric formulation of this approach, known as modal clustering, draws a correspondence between the groups and the domains of attraction of the density modes. Operationally, a nonparametric density estimate is required and a proper selection of the amount of smoothing, governing the shape of the density and hence possibly the modal structure, is crucial to identify the final partition.

To address this, fuzzers include distillation tools (e.g., afl-cmin) that select the smallest subset of seeds triggering the same range of instrumentation data points as the full corpus. Common practice suggests that minimizing the number and cumulative size of seeds leads to more efficient fuzzing, which we explore systematically. We present results from over 34 CPU-years of fuzzing with five distillation approaches to understand their impact on finding bugs in real-world software.",

However, most of the pruning techniques are essentially trade-offs between model accuracy and regularity which lead to impaired inference accuracy and limited on-device acceleration performance. To solve the problem, we introduce a new sparsity dimension, namely pattern-based sparsity that comprises pattern and connectivity sparsity, and becoming both highly accurate and hardware friendly. With carefully designed patterns, the proposed pruning unprecedentedly and consistently achieves accuracy enhancement and better feature extraction ability on different dnn structures and datasets, and our pattern-aware pruning framework also achieves pattern library extraction, pattern selection, pattern and connectivity pruning and weight training simultaneously. Our approach on the new pattern-based sparsity naturally fits into compiler optimization for highly efficient dnn execution on mobile platforms.",
