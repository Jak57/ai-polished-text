There has been a lot of movie watching going on around here lately. Here's my rundown; last night we watched thirteen, a movie every mother of a teen should see. It was better then i expected.

Yesterday, I had the opportunity to drive by our new home, and I was thrilled to see the front window filled with boxes - a tangible sign that our move is finally within reach. With closing potentially just around the corner, I'm growing increasingly excited at the prospect of receiving the keys. If all goes according to plan this week, we're on track to finalize the sale a week from Wednesday, and I can barely contain my anticipation. Last night was a late one, as Bethany and I indulged in a movie marathon that stretched well into the early hours of the morning. It's been a cinematic week, to say the least, and I thought I'd take a moment to share my thoughts on the films we've been watching. First up was \"Thirteen,\" a movie that I firmly believe every parent of a teenager should see. I was pleasantly surprised by its thought-provoking portrayal of adolescence, and I found it to be a far more impactful film than I had initially expected. In stark contrast, our second feature of the night was \"Gigli,\" a movie that has been widely panned by critics. While it's safe to say that the film lived up to its notorious reputation, we felt compelled to see it for ourselves, if only to satisfy our curiosity.",

The program follows hairstylist Jonathan Antin as he endeavors to expand his renowned West Hollywood salon to a second location in the affluent neighborhood of Beverly Hills. What initially seemed like a mundane premise quickly piqued my interest when I stumbled upon a captivating scene featuring Jonathan standing in an empty space on Rodeo Drive, proclaiming in a grandiose tone, \"I will create the greatest salon the world has ever known!\" His unbridled confidence and self-absorption are strangely mesmerizing, reminiscent of the captivating ineptitude of Rocco, a character from a previous television obsession.",

The wisdom and expertise of Robert Rubin are a breath of fresh air, and his presence is a stark reminder of the dearth of similarly esteemed individuals within the current administration's domestic policy team. Secondly, it is imperative to recognize that granting the Republicans unchecked control during wartime is no longer a viable option, given their ingenious yet troubling ability to perpetuate a state of endless, global conflict under the guise of the 'war on terrorism.'",

The current setup is far from ideal, and I must admit that witnessing someone's reactions to the less-than-satisfactory conditions can be quite amusing. The look of self-inflicted torture is, indeed, a comical sight, and I appreciate Akcron's candor in highlighting this issue.",

The fatigue is so overwhelming that it's become a struggle to stay awake. Last evening, I succumbed to it, retreating to the comfort of my home and surrendering to a deep slumber. It wasn't until my mother's voice pierced the darkness, calling me around 8:30, that I stirred back to life. Disoriented and groggy, I lay there for a few moments, trying to regain my bearings in the darkness. The only sound was my mother's voice, a lifeline that helped me reconnect with reality. I'm still trying to pinpoint the cause of this exhaustion. In stark contrast, the morning brought a welcome respite, with a gentle drizzle that seemed to wash away some of my fatigue. I've since learned that the rain has been relentless in Calcutta, with the city experiencing a three-day downpour.",

        "polished": "The previous evening was a low point, as I made the difficult decision to discard the sweater I had been painstakingly knitting. Despite having invested a considerable amount of time and effort, with approximately 14 inches of progress, I was forced to confront the reality that the project was beyond salvage. The financial loss was also significant, with the mohair yarn, priced at $8 per skein, amounting to around $10. Unfortunately, the sweater had developed an excessive number of stitches by the time I reached the armholes, and the mohair's tendency to knot itself together made it impossible to rectify the issue through the process of frogging, or ripping out rows. The yarn's fragility only added to the frustration, as it broke repeatedly, testing my patience. In a rare display of restraint, I refrained from expressing my disappointment vocally, instead channeling my emotions into a melancholic ripping motion, accompanied by the soothing sounds of Season 2 of Sex and the City, courtesy of the library. Eventually, my frustration reached a boiling point, and I made the impulsive decision to discard the sweater altogether. In retrospect, I can take solace in the fact that this experience, although disappointing, has provided me with valuable lessons that will undoubtedly inform my future knitting endeavors.",

Casey's \"Getting Back into Place: Toward a Renewed Study of the Place-World\" led to a thought-provoking exploration of the interplay between time and place in shaping our culture. The book's initial chapters, which delve into the concepts of \"implacement\" and \"displacement,\" offer a compelling critique of our contemporary world's preoccupation with time as the primary situating force. Casey astutely observes that our societal narratives often revolve around time, with phrases such as \"running out of time,\" \"saving time,\" and \"just in time\" dominating our discourse. In contrast, he posits that a place-centric approach to culture could foster a more grounded and cohesive community. While this summary barely scratches the surface of Casey's nuanced argument, it is clear that his work has resonated deeply, making it the first assigned reading to truly capture my attention.",

There is nothing better then to see the excitement on your childs face. After egg hunting, we all went to church. Even though the 'easter bunny' is fun and all.

We had planned to take Connor to Fireman's Park on Saturday, expecting to participate in the Easter egg hunt scheduled for 11am. However, upon arrival, we discovered that the event had actually taken place the day before. Fortunately, I had brought a backup plan - a bag of eggs - which allowed Connor to still enjoy an impromptu egg hunt in the park.\n\nThe next morning, Connor's face lit up with delight as he realized the Easter bunny had visited during the night. Witnessing the unbridled excitement of a child on a special occasion is truly a heartwarming experience. Following the egg hunt, we attended church as a family, ensuring that our children understand the true significance of the holiday.\n\nIt was also a special day for Megan, who celebrated her first Easter in style, looking adorable in her jean dress and stockings. Amidst the festive atmosphere, we made sure to strike a balance between the fun and games associated with the Easter bunny and the deeper meaning behind the holiday.",

The reality is that parents frequently have limited insight into our lives and struggles. This became particularly evident just a short while ago, when I found myself in a heated argument with Nicole regarding Kelli. Upon retreating to my room, my parents inquired about the source of my distress. I couldn't help but feel that their inquiry was intrusive, and I wished they would simply respect my boundaries. The situation between Nicole and Kelli is straightforward: they have an intense dislike for each other, a sentiment that is deeply ingrained and unlikely to change.",

Firstly, i think that the idea of having a law against flag-burning is completely nuts. The moment you start according a symbol - any symbol - that kind of automatic reverence and protection, you've taken a small but important step towards totalitarianism.

However, having initiated this conversation, I feel compelled to share my thoughts. In my opinion, the idea of enacting legislation to prohibit flag-burning is utterly misguided. The moment a symbol is afforded automatic reverence and protection, a subtle yet significant step is taken towards the erosion of democratic values and the gradual slide into totalitarianism.

Notably, Lad Lorenz does not anticipate that SoCal Gas will file a substantive challenge to the California Public Utilities Commission's (CPUC) decision. As the lead entity responsible for drafting the tariff sheets that will implement the settlement, SoCal Gas will undoubtedly play a crucial role in this process. I informed Lad that, in all likelihood, TW will closely monitor the implementation phase of the proceeding but is unlikely to mount a serious challenge to the CPUC's decision.",

        "polished": "The concept of ahimsa, a Sanskrit term denoting the profound principle of non-violence and non-injury towards all living beings, is rooted in the philosophy of refraining from causing harm. Derived from the Sanskrit words 'a,' meaning 'not,' and 'himsa,' signifying 'injury,' this concept has been a cornerstone of various Eastern philosophies. As Mahatma Gandhi's understanding of ahimsa evolved, he became increasingly mindful of the impact of his thoughts and words, as reflected in his autobiography, The Story of My Experiments with Truth. In it, he expresses his discomfort with certain lines from a national anthem, which seemed to contradict the very essence of ahimsa. Today, on October 2, we commemorate the birth of this visionary leader, who was born in 1869. Despite the passage of time, Gandhi's life and message remain remarkably relevant, offering valuable insights and guidance for contemporary society.",

One inherent issue with prequels is that they often feel like a step backward in the narrative, rather than a progression forward.

Unfortunately, the combat mechanics in this game fall short of the standard set by its predecessor, Arkham City, with a noticeable lack of sharpness and precision. At the time of writing, a game-breaking bug exists that prevents the completion of a side mission, although the main storyline remains unaffected.

The inability to reload a previous save at that critical juncture was particularly frustrating. To mitigate such catastrophic failures, I've since resorted to utilizing a third-party mod and save tool. Additionally, the aiming reticule could benefit from being slightly larger, and the zoom feature feels somewhat underwhelming. Nevertheless, the game's unique blend of strategy, mission-based gameplay, and first-person shooter and beat-em-up elements has proven to be an irresistible combination. As someone who doesn't typically gravitate towards zombie-themed games, I've found myself thoroughly enthralled by this experience. The game's engaging nature has led me to play it whenever possible, often finding myself drawn into just one more mission or supply run, and frequently having to tear myself away to ensure a safe exit before shutting down the game.",

The ingame chat box at the main menu is very entertaining as well, no i am not kidding. However, if anyone thinking this game is 'easy', or if you are new to the strategy genre, it could take you quite some time to get it nailed down. Do not get upset, you will lose a lot of units.

        "polished": "This exceptional strategy game stands out from the rest, offering a unique experience that seamlessly integrates with other notable titles in the genre, such as European Escalation and ALB. The sheer scale of the game is impressive, boasting an extensive array of units that adds depth and complexity to the gameplay. The visuals are stunning, with beautifully rendered graphics that immerse players in the game world. The sound design is equally impressive, complementing the on-screen action with a rich and engaging audio experience. The overall gameplay is nothing short of epic, with a steep learning curve that rewards careful planning and strategic thinking. Even the in-game chat feature, accessible from the main menu, offers a surprisingly entertaining distraction. However, newcomers to the strategy genre should be prepared for a challenging experience, as mastering the game's intricacies can take time.

        "polished": "Here's a comprehensive analysis of the game, highlighting its strengths and weaknesses, followed by my personal thoughts.\n\nThe game boasts several notable advantages. Firstly, the characters are exceptionally well-developed, making them relatable and engaging. The storyline is also commendable, with a narrative that is both immersive and captivating. Furthermore, the game offers an abundance of content, ensuring that players remain engaged for an extended period. Another significant advantage is the high degree of character customization, allowing players to create a protagonist that suits their preferences, including the option to choose between male and female characters. Additionally, the game allows players to form romantic relationships with many of their companions, a feature that is sure to delight fans of character-driven storytelling.\n\nHowever, the game is not without its drawbacks. One notable weakness is the subpar graphics, although it's worth noting that this aspect may not be a significant concern for many players. The game's romantic scenes can also feel awkward and unnatural at times. Furthermore, the presence of invisible walls can be frustrating, as they can limit player exploration and immersion. One particular mission may also feel dull to some players, although this is largely a matter of personal taste.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that the game's protagonist is a silent character, which may be a point of interest for some players.\n\nIn my opinion, this game is truly exceptional. It's likely one of the best RPGs I've ever had the pleasure of playing, and I would highly recommend it to fans of the genre. If you're an RPG enthusiast, chances are you already have this game in your collection, but if not, it's definitely worth considering.",

The voice actors for optimus, megatron, bumblebee, and many others are back, and instantly recognisable. The distinctive cartoon transformation sound is there. Graphically, the cell-shaded presentation is perfect, and very, very generation one. But aside from that, it's actually a very fun game. The combat mechanics are extremely well done. Transforming mid-fight is often a necessity, and woven seamlessly into combos, making it quite unlike high moon's excellent war for/fall of cybertron games. Another distinction is the heavy focus on melee combat, but some enemies (e.g. Seekers) require a switch to a ranged blaster.",
        "polished": "For those who grew up in the UK during the 80s and 90s, this game is a nostalgic dream come true, evoking memories of watching the iconic Transformers cartoon, albeit often as a means to endure the antics of Timmy Mallet. The return of the original voice cast, including the legendary actors behind Optimus Prime, Megatron, and Bumblebee, is a masterstroke, with their instantly recognisable voices transporting players back to a bygone era. The unmistakable sound effect that accompanies the Transformers' signature transformations is also faithfully recreated, adding to the game's retro charm. Visually, the cell-shaded graphics are a perfect homage to the Generation One aesthetic, capturing the essence of the classic cartoon. However, beneath its nostalgic veneer lies a genuinely enjoyable gaming experience. The combat mechanics are expertly crafted, with the ability to transform mid-battle seamlessly integrated into combos, setting it apart from other notable Transformers titles. Notably, the game places a strong emphasis on melee combat, although certain enemies, such as the formidable Seekers, necessitate a tactical switch to ranged attacks, adding a welcome layer of depth to the gameplay.",

Fortunately, these sections can be skipped at the player's discretion. In terms of controls, the game is highly customizable, allowing players to rebind keys and buttons to suit their preferred playstyle, whether that's with a gamepad or a keyboard and mouse setup.

I particularly enjoyed the 'dual play' segments (where you can play batman + 1 more), and the ability to use the controller for most segments of the game but the mouse and keyboard for the tank combat segments was greatly appreciated. Driving your batmobile around the free-roam city, including when chasing the apc commanders, is actually quite enjoyable once you figure out how to use the breaks to skid around corners (and when you master that, driving around the city is really quite enjoyable!)",

Specifically, the game's tendency to repopulate the open-world city area with new enemies after each story progression can be somewhat frustrating. However, this is more than offset by the game's numerous strengths, including the innovative 'dual play' feature, which allows players to control two characters simultaneously, and the flexibility to switch between controller and mouse-and-keyboard controls for different segments of the game, such as the tank combat sequences. One of the most enjoyable aspects of the game is the opportunity to explore the open-world city in the Batmobile, particularly when engaging in high-speed pursuits of APC commanders.

When i played version 1.00 -&gt; 1.03 my game never crashed, i didnt see any bugs. Also i have noticed that after 1.03 patch drawing distance sometimes is horrible, starting to draw objects when youre really close, sometimes even people. But if forgetting all these bugs, crashes and drawdistance 'bugs', this is really fantastic game, they made huge effort on quests, some of them really emotional and deep, lots of side quests, and the fact that your decision effects a lot in this game.

        "polished": "For fans of the first two Witcher installments, the third iteration is an absolute must-have. Initially, I would have awarded this game a perfect score of 10/10, but unfortunately, the 1.03 update introduced a plethora of bugs and random crashes, necessitating extremely frequent saving. In contrast, my experience with versions 1.00 to 1.03 was remarkably smooth, with no crashes or noticeable bugs. However, the 1.03 patch also brought about inconsistent drawing distances, often resulting in objects and even characters materializing at alarmingly close proximity. Despite these technical issues, the game shines in its narrative and gameplay aspects. The developers have made a tremendous effort in crafting engaging quests, many of which are emotionally resonant and deeply impactful. The game also boasts a multitude of side quests and a dynamic decision-making system, where player choices have significant consequences. Having invested over 50 hours into the game, I remain thoroughly enthralled and eager to continue my journey.",

Technical issues also abound, including a plethora of bugs that can significantly impact gameplay. A notable example of this is the permanent loss of the Pip-Boy, which can only be resolved through the use of console commands. The game's handling of power armor is also a point of contention, as it is readily available from the outset and can be easily maintained through the abundance of power cores in trader shops. This oversaturation diminishes the value and prestige associated with power armor in previous Fallout titles. While the game's stability is a notable improvement over Fallout 3, its overall quality is mediocre, with a narrative that fails to impress.

The deadline marks the point at which fiat will gain the right to sell its car division to gm, part of an alliance agreed in 2000. Gm, whose own european operations are losing money, no longer wants to own the unprofitable fiat unit. Reports of deadlocked talks sent fiat shares down 1.2% on tuesday, after monday's 4% gain on hopes of a payoff. The us firm is thought to be offering about $2bn (\u00a31.06bn) to extricate itself from the arrangement. It has argued the deal was voided by fiat's decision to sell off fiat's finance arm and halve gm's stake via a capital-raising effort. The 2000 deal resulted from a race between gm and daimlerchrysler to ally with fiat.",

By midnight on 1 February, the two automotive giants must come to a mutually agreeable solution, or Fiat will be entitled to offload its struggling car division to GM, as stipulated in their 2000 alliance agreement. However, GM, which is grappling with significant losses in its European operations, has grown increasingly reluctant to assume ownership of Fiat's unprofitable unit. The stalled negotiations have taken a toll on Fiat's stock, with shares plummeting 1.2% on Tuesday, following a 4% surge on Monday fueled by speculation of a potential payout. GM is reportedly offering a substantial $2 billion (\u00a31.06 billion) to extricate itself from the arrangement, citing Fiat's decision to divest its finance arm and dilute GM's stake through a capital-raising initiative as grounds for voiding the original deal. The 2000 agreement was the culmination of a fierce bidding war between GM and DaimlerChrysler to secure a strategic partnership with Fiat.",

Contrary to speculation in the media suggesting that Santini felt his authority was being eroded by Arnesen's influence, the Sporting Director has come forward to set the record straight. In an interview with BBC Radio Five Live, Arnesen categorically denied any rift, stating that Santini's decision to step down was solely due to personal issues. \"It is absolutely not true,\" Arnesen emphasized, adding that Santini had recently confided in him about the matter, describing it as a deeply personal concern.

It allows fast estimation by avoiding computations of a whole numerical solution in the likelihood. The posterior is obtained by a variational bayes method, more specifically, the approximate riemannian conjugate gradient method (honkela et al.",
        "polished": "A mathematical framework widely employed across diverse disciplines, including climatology, bioinformatics, and chemical engineering, is the ordinary differential equation (ODE). Its inherent appeal lies in its capacity to model complex phenomena, making it a staple in various application areas. However, the frequent absence of analytical solutions for ODEs poses a significant challenge in estimating model parameters from empirical data, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional systems characterized by numerous variables and parameters. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a novel Bayesian algorithm for estimating ODE parameters, distinguished by its remarkable speed and accuracy, even in the presence of complex models with multiple parameters. By approximating the ODE model using a state-space representation derived from the equations of a numerical solver, the proposed method enables rapid estimation by circumventing the need for exhaustive numerical solutions in the likelihood computation. Furthermore, the posterior distribution is obtained through a variational Bayesian approach, specifically the approximate Riemannian conjugate gradient method, as described by Honkela et al.",

To address this limitation, we propose a novel weight-exponentiated formulation for the random effects distribution, enabling unbiased estimation of hyperparameters. A comparative analysis with frequentist approaches, which often rely on numerical integration, reveals that our Bayesian method uniquely achieves unbiased estimation with respect to the sampling design distribution, while maintaining consistency with the population-generating distribution. Through comprehensive simulations and a real-world example involving a survey of business establishments, we demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of our approach across diverse modeling formulations and sampling designs.

The mere thought of speaking in public can evoke a visceral response, as if one's very reputation hangs in the balance. It's a phenomenon that transcends the realm of rational fear, tapping into our primal anxieties as social creatures. The fear of being judged, of being perceived as inadequate, can be suffocating, rendering even the most articulate among us mute. Yet, it's an inevitability that we've all faced at some point \u2013 the daunting task of communicating in front of an audience. To begin to overcome this phobia, it's essential to grasp its underlying dynamics. At its core, stage fright is a manifestation of our deep-seated concern for social standing. The prospect of public speaking can be perceived as a threat to our reputation, triggering a maelstrom of self-doubt and anxiety. As we stand poised to address a crowd, our minds are often consumed by the haunting question: \"What if I'm met with ridicule and disdain, my intellect and character called into question?",

In reality, the modern workforce is characterized by a diverse array of employment arrangements, with approximately 15% of American workers opting for non-traditional, full-time employment. Instead, they navigate a landscape of part-time, contract, and temporary positions, often piecing together multiple income streams to sustain themselves. This contemporary ethos has given rise to the concept of the \"side hustle,\" a term that encapsulates the resourceful and adaptable nature of individuals seeking to create a fulfilling and financially stable life. Interestingly, the origins of the term \"side hustle\" can be traced back to popular African American newspapers of the 1920s, where \"hustle\" initially referred to illicit schemes. However, by the 1950s, the phrase \"side hustle\" had evolved to encompass legitimate, supplementary work. It is essential to distinguish a side hustle from a second job, as the latter is often driven by necessity, whereas the former represents a deliberate choice to diversify one's professional pursuits and cultivate a more dynamic, self-directed career path.",

His creative output was nothing short of phenomenal, with timeless classics emerging at an astonishing pace. However, a small but vocal minority began to raise concerns, accusing Dylan of appropriating the work of others. Fast-forward to 2004, when Brian Burton, aka Danger Mouse, embarked on an innovative project. By seamlessly merging the Beatles' iconic \"White Album\" with Jay-Z's \"The Black Album,\" he created the groundbreaking \"The Grey Album.\" This bold remix quickly gained widespread attention online, prompting the Beatles' record company to issue a flurry of cease-and-desist letters, citing unfair competition and the dilution of their valuable intellectual property.

Unlike human technologies, which often falter in complex or unfamiliar environments, natural systems like those found in cockroaches exhibit remarkable stability and adaptability. One striking example of this is the cockroach's ability to self-stabilize while navigating rough terrain, a feat that is all the more impressive given that it is achieved without the need for cognitive processing. Even when subjected to external perturbations, such as the addition of a jet pack or the simulation of an earthquake, the cockroach's finely tuned legs enable it to maintain its balance and composure. Furthermore, these insects can effortlessly traverse complex terrain, including grass, without becoming destabilized. In fact, researchers have discovered a novel behavior in which cockroaches use their body shape to automatically roll onto their side, allowing them to navigate through dense vegetation with ease. This remarkable adaptability is a hallmark of robust systems, which are capable of performing multiple tasks using the same underlying structure.

My journey to address this issue began eight years ago, when I first took the stage at TED, fresh out of graduate school. At the time, I was unaware that my brief presentation would set the tone for the questions I would be grappling with for the next decade. Like many young idealists, I was convinced that I could single-handedly solve the world's water problems through technological innovation. However, I soon discovered that the reality was far more complex. I had initially been misled into believing that the persistence of water quality issues was primarily due to the difficulty in identifying them. I assumed that the solution lay in developing simpler, faster, and more affordable sensors. This assumption proved to be misguided, and I have since come to realize that the challenges we face are far more nuanced.",

Those air vibrations are traveling to you, they're hitting your eardrums, and then your brain takes those vibrations from your eardrums and transforms them into thoughts. I hope.

As I speak, my vocalizations create a cascade of pressure waves that propagate through the atmosphere, eventually reaching your ears and triggering a response in your brain. This process, known as auditory perception, enables your brain to decode the vibrations and interpret them as meaningful thoughts and ideas.

His prophetic warnings foreshadowed the impending threats that humanity would face in the years to come. In stark contrast, the world of advertising often presents a more superficial reality. For instance, the search for the perfect wedding dress can be a daunting task, but a modern twist on a classic design can offer a refreshing alternative. Characterized by its sleek silhouette, flattering lines, and modest charm, this reimagined dress embodies the very essence of traditional wedding attire. Meanwhile, the world of commercials often grates on our nerves with its relentless barrage of sales pitches. Nine years after Hansen's testimony, in 1997, the United States Senate convened a hearing to discuss the pressing issue of global warming. During this gathering, expert witnesses drew attention to the Earth's history, highlighting periods that were warmer than the 20th century, thus adding a layer of complexity to the ongoing debate.",
