The moment you start according a symbol - any symbol - that kind of automatic reverence and protection, you've taken a small but important step towards totalitarianism.

The voice actors for optimus, megatron, bumblebee, and many others are back, and instantly recognisable. The distinctive cartoon transformation sound is there. Graphically, the cell-shaded presentation is perfect, and very, very generation one. But aside from that, it's actually a very fun game. The combat mechanics are extremely well done. Transforming mid-fight is often a necessity, and woven seamlessly into combos, making it quite unlike high moon's excellent war for/fall of cybertron games. Another distinction is the heavy focus on melee combat, but some enemies (e.g. Seekers) require a switch to a ranged blaster.",

That sounds exciting!' Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t quite live up to my expectations. The game begins by asking you to choose between being a Republican or a Democrat, with no option for independents or third parties. Although slightly disheartened, I remained hopeful and continued to explore the game\u2019s possibilities.

In this context, two physical RC systems have been proposed and modeled: one based on a single magnetic skyrmion memristor (MSM) for image classification, and another using 24 spin-torque nano-oscillators (STNOs) for predicting nonlinear dynamic systems. Our micromagnetic simulations show that the nonlinear responses of MSMs and STNOs, triggered by current pulse stimulation, demonstrate that an RC system incorporating a single MSM excels in recognizing handwritten digits for image classification tasks. Additionally, complex and unknown nonlinear dynamic problems are effectively addressed by a physical RC system comprising 24 STNOs, as evidenced by its performance in second-order nonlinear dynamic system predictions and NARMA10 tasks.",

In this paper, we identify a surprising consequence of popularity-based rankings: the fewer the items reporting a given signal, the higher the share of the overall traffic they collectively attract. This few-get-richer effect emerges in settings where there are few distinct classes of items (e.g., left-leaning news sources versus right-leaning news sources), and items are ranked based on their popularity. We demonstrate analytically that the few-get-richer effect emerges when people tend to click on top-ranked items and have heterogeneous preferences for the classes of items. Using simulations, we analyze how the strength of the effect changes with assumptions about the setting and human behavior. We also test our predictions experimentally in an online experiment with human participants. Our findings have important implications to understand the spread of misinformation.",

We provide a theoretical demonstration that this effect arises when users click predominantly on top-ranked items and exhibit diverse preferences toward different item categories. Through simulations, we examine how varying assumptions about the environment and user behavior impact the intensity of this effect.

To solve the problem, we introduce a new sparsity dimension, namely pattern-based sparsity that comprises pattern and connectivity sparsity, and becoming both highly accurate and hardware friendly. With carefully designed patterns, the proposed pruning unprecedentedly and consistently achieves accuracy enhancement and better feature extraction ability on different dnn structures and datasets, and our pattern-aware pruning framework also achieves pattern library extraction, pattern selection, pattern and connectivity pruning and weight training simultaneously.

Unlike our current use of coins, the Yapese didn't physically exchange or move these stones due to their immense size; the largest ones could weigh up to four tons and measure 12 feet across.

And at the time, there wasn't really that much information about the company, but the little that was there was really impressive. Essentially, what the company was doing was creating a medical device where you would be able to run your entire blood panel on a finger-stick of blood. So you wouldn't have to get a big needle stuck in your arm in order to get your blood test done. So this was interesting not only because it was less painful, but also, it could potentially open the door to predictive diagnostics.",
