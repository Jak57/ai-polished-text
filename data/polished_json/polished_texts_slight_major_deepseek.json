McAllister then doubled the lead, arriving at the back post to nod home Saul Mikoliunas' cross, putting the game out of Livingston's reach. Craig Easton pulled one back with a contentious header after an hour, but Hearts stood firm.  \n\nThe breakthrough came after Gus Bahoken's clumsy challenge on Miller 35 yards from goal. McAllister delivered a precise free-kick into the box, where Miller outjumped Livingston's static defense to direct his header over Meldrum. Just 10 minutes in, Hearts extended their advantage when Mikoliunas surged down the right flank and delivered a cross to the far post, where McAllister arrived to power his header past the keeper.",

We show that all local minima share the same form of structure that partially identifies the component centers of the true mixture, in the sense that each local minimum involves a non-overlapping combination of fitting multiple gaussians to a single true component and fitting a single gaussian to multiple true components. Our results apply to the setting where the true mixture components satisfy a certain separation condition, and are valid even when the number of components is over-or under-specified.

In this study, we observe superfluidity in an ultracold 2D Fermi gas by moving a periodic potential through the system and detecting the absence of dissipation below a critical velocity \\(v_{\\rm c}\\). We measure \\(v_{\\rm c}\\) across varying interaction strengths and identify a peak in the crossover regime between bosonic and fermionic superfluidity. These results firmly establish ultracold Fermi gases as a versatile platform for exploring the effects of reduced dimensionality on strongly correlated superfluids.",
