I didn't even swear, which is unusual for me. I just gloomily ripped and listened to season two of Sex and the City (thanks to the library!). Eventually, I got fed up and threw it away.

Our simulations and real data example for a survey of business establishments demonstrate the utility of our approach across different modeling formulations and sampling designs.
