By gary fineout and alfonso chardy the citizenship ceremony in jacksonville seemed to go off as usual, with a crowd of nearly 200 people going home as new americans. Just before the new citizens left the june 29 event, an immigration official directing the swearing-in urged them to stop by a voter registration table -- a not uncommon sight at naturalization ceremonies. But this table was unusual: those handing out forms were republican volunteers -- and the party affiliation box had been checked off ahead of time to make all of the new voters members of the gop.

We find that the differential conductance and induced pairing amplitudes strongly depend on the angle between the junction direction in real space and the axis separating the Weyl nodes in momentum space. We identify the influence of a chiral chemical potential, i.e., the electron population imbalance between Weyl nodes of opposite chirality, on the transport characteristics of the junction. Remarkably, we observe a net spin polarization of Cooper pairs that are generated via Andreev reflection in the two WSM regions. The spin polarization is opposite in the two WSM regions and highly sensitive to the chirality imbalance and excitation energy.",

Importantly, it provides a method for grading the voltage drop across high voltage insulators, and thereby increasing the maximum operational voltage that can be applied across the insulator without surface flashover. However a concern for the use of the method is the long term stability of the implantation-induced conductivity, this especially so if the implanted metal species is readily oxidized. Here we report on our examination of the long-term behavior of the surface conductivity of titanium-implanted alumina.

For the first time, it was found that in a mesogenic polymer, in contrast to low-molecular-weight mesogens, the relaxation of the electric birefringence of a melt above the temperature of the nematic-isotropic phase transition can be presented by a sum of several exponential processes, two of which play a decisive role. These main processes replace each other in a temperature range of about fifty degrees. Dielectric spectroscopy also made it possible to distinguish two processes of orientational relaxation: the first is due to rotation of the side mesogenic groups, and the second is associated with motion of the main chain segments.",
