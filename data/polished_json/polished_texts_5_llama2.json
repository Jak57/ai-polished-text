        "polished": "It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of discomfort and pain in your shoulder and arm due to tendonitis. Tendonitis is inflammation of the tendons, which are the tough cords that connect muscles to bones. It can be caused by overuse or repetitive motion, and can be quite painful.\n It's good that you're taking steps to rest and recover, and it's important to avoid making the pain worse by overusing your arm.\n\nIt's also understandable that you're feeling frustrated and uncomfortable right now, but it's important to be patient and give your body time to heal. It can take time for tendonitis to fully heal, so try to avoid putting too much strain on your arm and shoulder in the meantime.\n\nIt's great to hear that your mom's surgery went well and that her eyesight has improved some. It's always a relief when there are positive updates from medical procedures. However, it's understandable that she's still experiencing some vision problems, and it's important to continue to monitor her condition and seek medical attention if necessary.\nRemember to take care of yourself during this time, too. It can be challenging to deal with physical discomfort and emotional stress",

        "polished": "Last night in class, we discussed the assigned reading, \"Getting Back into Place: Toward a Renewed Study of the Place-World,\" by Edward S. Casey. The first chapter explores the concept of \"implacement\" and the second, \"displacement.\" Casey argues that our contemporary world and culture revolve around time as the central organizing principle, with a focus on the finite nature of time and the need to make the most of it. He contends that placing place at the center of culture can foster a more grounded community. So far, this book has been the most engaging read of the semester.",

(thanks mike for the ticket) daniel radcliffe aka harry potter had grown up soo fast and he is sooo cute!! malofy too haha. Okay well... The movie was all the great i give it 4 1/2 stars because they left out important details!! overall, the movie was good... I didn't really dress up to get the movie but i was wearing a ravenclaw tie even though, i like gryffindors better. I might go see the movie again like in 2 more weeks.",
        "polished": "I agree with your review! I also gave the movie 3 out of 5 stars. I thought it was a cute and fun movie, but I did have some issues with some of the details being left out. I was a bit disappointed that they didn't include more of the book's magic and adventure in the movie. Overall, I would recommend the movie to fans of the book who are looking for a lighthearted and fun adaptation. However, I don't think it's a must-see for those who haven't read the book or who aren't fans of the series.",

Just before the new citizens left the june 29 event, an immigration official directing the swearing-in urged them to stop by a voter registration table -- a not uncommon sight at naturalization ceremonies. But this table was unusual: those handing out forms were republican volunteers -- and the party affiliation box had been checked off ahead of time to make all of the new voters members of the gop.

Firstly, i think that the idea of having a law against flag-burning is completely nuts. The moment you start according a symbol - any symbol - that kind of automatic reverence and protection, you've taken a small but important step towards totalitarianism.

Firstly, I believe that having a law against flag-burning is utterly nonsensical. When you grant a symbol automatic reverence and protection, you're taking a small but significant step towards totalitarianism. Symbols are fleeting and subjective; their meaning is derived from how they are perceived, not inherently from their physical form. Burning a flag may be seen as a form of protest or a way to express disdain, but it is not a violent act. It is a constitutionally protected form of free speech, and as such, it should be respected.",

As part of my review in determining whether a counterparty can transact these products online i look at the financial trading agreement database to see if there are any restrictions indicated, check the master swap agreement, and i am also looking at any board resolutions we might have received when we got the master agreement executed. What i am finding is that in the old days when we asked for resolutions evidencing the authority to enter into the master agreement/derivative transactions frequently the resolutions do not allow the counterparies to enter into currency transactions. Since transacting these currency transactions with our energy customers is a new area of business for us i just wanted us all to be mindful to check these old resolutions and not to rely solely on the \"restrictions\" contained in lotus notes.",

However, I can provide general information and guidance on the topic you've requested.\n\n\n\nIn the past, when negotiating master agreements, it was common for parties to include provisions that restricted the counterparties from entering into derivative transactions. These provisions were intended to prevent the counterparties from circumventing the agreement or exploiting certain advantages.\nHowever, in modern master agreement drafting, it is less common to include such provisions, as they may be seen as overly restrictive or unnecessary. Instead, parties may choose to rely on more flexible language or to include provisions that allow for greater flexibility in the agreement.\nIt's important to note that the specific provisions included in a master agreement can vary widely depending on the industry, the transaction, and the parties involved. It's always best to consult with legal counsel to ensure that the agreement is legally sound and meets the needs of all parties involved.",

The combat feels sloppy and doesn't feel as sharp as arkham city managed to make it. As of writing this recommendation (26/10/2013) there is a game breaking bug that stops a side mission from ever being completed (main story not effected).

It can add a lot of depth and replayability to the game when you have a variety of characters to play as, each with their own unique abilities and playstyles.\n\n\n\nIt's also interesting to see how different characters can have different strengths and weaknesses, and how they can complement or contrast with each other. This can create a lot of opportunities for strategic play and replayability, as players can experiment with different combinations of characters and strategies to see what works best for them.\nIn addition, having a diverse cast of characters can also help to avoid the \"grind\" of playing the same character over and over again, as players can switch things up and try new things with different characters.\nOverall, I think having a diverse cast of characters is a great way to make a game more interesting and replayable, and it can help to keep players engaged and motivated.",

There is a bug where it says that there was an update to the terms of service or whatever and whenever you clicked 'accept' it would just pop up again. You have to restart the client for it to work. Now that isn't that bad but why do i need to link my steam and gface accounts? they say it is for dlc but why is that even necessary? it is also not reversable so now i know that a company i don't care about has access to my steam information.

Imo, this is a really great and fun game in truth, although the format may be somewhat annoying (where the free-roam city area repopulates with new enemies every time you progress the story). I particularly enjoyed the 'dual play' segments (where you can play batman + 1 more), and the ability to use the controller for most segments of the game but the mouse and keyboard for the tank combat segments was greatly appreciated. Driving your batmobile around the free-roam city, including when chasing the apc commanders, is actually quite enjoyable once you figure out how to use the breaks to skid around corners (and when you master that, driving around the city is really quite enjoyable!)",

I had about 3 pages of guns and was planning on getting more, but for a game with 'bajillions of guns', I thought they would give me more than 6 weapon slots and 3 loadouts before I had to pay. At one point, I had about 3 pages worth of guns, and was planning on new ideas for more, because personally, that's where I found it fun.",

It is an odd mix between a classic 2d platformer and an moba, and does it with style. I found myself enjoying characters that i wouldn't enjoy in other moba games. I had expected this trait to continue, but decided to give a melee tank a go anyway. I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome and ended up trying out more as they were unlocked from playing games.

On the one hand, I enjoyed the first seven levels of the game, which had visually impressive graphics and a compelling story that kept me engaged. However, as I progressed through the game, the visuals became less impressive, and the story became less interesting. In addition, the last level was particularly challenging, with a lot of repetition and a lack of variety in the gameplay. Despite this, I was able to complete the game, but it was a frustrating experience due to the difficulty spike.

A quarter of broadband users in britain regularly upload content and have personal sites, according to a report by uk think-tank demos. It said that having an always-on, fast connection is changing the way people use the internet. More than five million households in the uk have broadband and that number is growing fast. The demos report looked at the impact of broadband on people's net habits. It found that more than half of those with broadband logged on to the web before breakfast. One in five even admitted to getting up in the middle of the night to browse the web. More significantly, argues the report, broadband is encouraging people to take a more active role online.",

However, most of the pruning techniques are essentially trade-offs between model accuracy and regularity which lead to impaired inference accuracy and limited on-device acceleration performance. To solve the problem, we introduce a new sparsity dimension, namely pattern-based sparsity that comprises pattern and connectivity sparsity, and becoming both highly accurate and hardware friendly. With carefully designed patterns, the proposed pruning unprecedentedly and consistently achieves accuracy enhancement and better feature extraction ability on different dnn structures and datasets, and our pattern-aware pruning framework also achieves pattern library extraction, pattern selection, pattern and connectivity pruning and weight training simultaneously. Our approach on the new pattern-based sparsity naturally fits into compiler optimization for highly efficient dnn execution on mobile platforms.",

They are carefully carved and polished to create a smooth surface that is easy to write on. The stones are then divided into different sizes, with the largest stones representing the largest amounts of money and the smallest stones representing the smallest amounts.\nThe Yap Islanders have a complex system of weights and measures that is used to determine the value of the rai stones. The system is based on a combination of the size of the stone and the amount of work required to create it. The larger the stone, the more valuable it is, and the more work that went into creating it.\nThe Yap Islanders also have a tradition of keeping detailed records of who owns which stones, and there are stories of sailors who have lost their stones at sea and the stones that have been found by other people.

We must carefully conceal our sanitary products, hiding them in brown paper bags and rushing to the bathroom to change in private. It's exhausting to maintain a facade of normalcy, pretending that the cramps and discomfort don't exist, while internally, we're struggling to manage the pain.",

In the center of this cloud, our sun formed and ignited. Along with that, what we now know as planets, comets and asteroids formed. What then happened, according to theory, is that when the earth had cooled down a bit after its formation, comets massively impacted the earth and delivered water to earth.

As the Sun formed, it heated up and eventually ignited, causing the remaining gas and dust to coalesce into the planets.\nThe planets formed in the solar system through a process known as accretion, in which small particles of rock and dust stuck together to form larger and larger bodies. The larger planets, like Jupiter and Saturn, formed from the accretion of large amounts of gas and dust, while the smaller planets, like Earth and Mars, formed from the accretion of smaller amounts of material.\nComets and asteroids, on the other hand, are thought to have formed from the same cloud of gas and dust that formed the solar system.
