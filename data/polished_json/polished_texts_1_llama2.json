I'm not too happy right now, but i'll get better. My mom's surgery went ok. Her eyesight has come back some. She can see fuzzy shapes and make out colors.

        "polished": "It sounds like you're experiencing some discomfort and pain in your shoulder and arm due to tendonitis. Tendonitis is an inflammation of the tendons, which are the tissues that connect muscles to bones. It can be caused by overuse or repetitive motion, and can be quite painful.\n It's possible that you may need to take some time off from using your arm and shoulder to allow the tendon to heal. In the meantime, you can try some gentle stretching and resting to help alleviate the pain.\n\nIt's also important to make sure you're getting enough sleep and taking care of yourself overall. Lack of sleep can exacerbate pain and make it more difficult to recover from injuries.\n\nIt's great to hear that your mom's surgery went well and that her eyesight has improved some. It's understandable that she's still experiencing some vision loss, but every little bit of improvement is a positive sign. I hope her vision continues to improve and that she's able to see clearly soon.",

        "polished": "Last night was the worst. I threw away the sweater I was knitting. I only had about 14 inches left, but it was a total disaster. The yarn was knotting itself together and I couldn't fix it. I tried frogging (ripping out rows) but it didn't work well. I even managed to break the yarn several times. I'm not sure if I'll be able to finish the sweater at this rate. I'm not even mad, though. I just threw it away. Maybe I'll try again someday. In the meantime, I watched two seasons of Sex and the City on Netflix. It was a good distraction.",

A cross-default occurs when a borrower fails to make payments on a loan or loans and the lender takes action to enforce the default, such as by accelerating the loan or selling the collateral.\n\nThe term \"cross-default\" is used to describe a situation where a borrower is in default on multiple loans with different lenders.

The story starts out extremely rough but does get much much better as you play (i think this is with every ac game personally). Edward was quite the interesting character and so was all the side characters. I felt like all the collectables actually meant something in this ac game that i never got from any of the previous ones and maybe its because i felt like they had a bigger purpose in the game. They def were not required but they were fun to get and you got rewarded in a very balanced way.",
        "polished": "I completely agree with you! The side characters in the AC series are often the most interesting and memorable characters, and they play a crucial role in the story and gameplay. They are not just there to provide additional flavor and personality to the game, but they also have their own motivations, personalities, and backstories that make them feel like real people.\n\n\nAnd I think that's one of the things that makes the AC series stand out from other games. While other games might have a few supporting characters that are fun to play as, the AC series has a whole cast of well-developed, complex characters that you can relate to and invest in.\nIt's not just about getting the next collectible or completing the next side mission, it's about understanding the motivations and desires of the characters and how they fit into the larger story.\nAnd I think that's something that sets the AC series apart from other games in the open-world genre. While other games might focus more on the open-world aspect of exploration and combat, the AC series is more focused on the story and character development. It's a game that makes you think about the motivations and actions of the characters, and how they impact the world around them.\nAnd that",

The voice actors for optimus, megatron, bumblebee, and many others are back, and instantly recognisable. The distinctive cartoon transformation sound is there. Graphically, the cell-shaded presentation is perfect, and very, very generation one. But aside from that, it's actually a very fun game. The combat mechanics are extremely well done. Transforming mid-fight is often a necessity, and woven seamlessly into combos, making it quite unlike high moon's excellent war for/fall of cybertron games. Another distinction is the heavy focus on melee combat, but some enemies (e.g. Seekers) require a switch to a ranged blaster.",

Imo, this is a really great and fun game in truth, although the format may be somewhat annoying (where the free-roam city area repopulates with new enemies every time you progress the story). I particularly enjoyed the 'dual play' segments (where you can play batman + 1 more), and the ability to use the controller for most segments of the game but the mouse and keyboard for the tank combat segments was greatly appreciated. Driving your batmobile around the free-roam city, including when chasing the apc commanders, is actually quite enjoyable once you figure out how to use the breaks to skid around corners (and when you master that, driving around the city is really quite enjoyable!)",

The game's controls can be a bit tricky to get used to, especially if you're coming from a console background, but the game does offer a good variety of control options to suit different playstyles.\n\n\nThe game's default controls are set up for a gamepad, with the right analog stick for movement, the left stick for aiming and shooting, and the face buttons for interacting with the game world and using your gadgets. However, you can also customize the controls to suit your preferences.\nYou can rebind the controls to your keyboard and mouse, or use a gamepad with custom layout. The game also supports VR controls, so if you have a VR headset, you can play the game with even more immersive controls.\nOverall, the controls in Batman: Arkham Knight are well-implemented and offer a good balance between precision and ease of use, so you should be able to find a control scheme that works well for you.",

On the one hand, the visuals and sound design were impressive and engaging throughout the game, particularly in the earlier levels. The variety of environments and enemies were interesting and challenging, and I enjoyed the sense of progression and accomplishment that came with completing each level. However, as the game progressed, the visuals became less impressive and the gameplay became more frustrating. The last level in particular was particularly challenging, as the game's difficulty spiked significantly and I found myself repeating the same actions over and over again until I finally managed to complete it. Additionally, the achievements were not as rewarding as I had hoped, with only 13 out of 15 achievements being unlocked by less than 2% of players. Overall, while the game had some enjoyable moments, it was not without its flaws and I would not recommend it to those looking for a challenging and rewarding gaming experience.",

The unnamed woman from georgia says that a chip inside the cartridge tells the printer that it needs re-filling even when it does not. The lawsuit seeks to represent anyone in the us who has purchased an hp inkjet printer since february 2001. Hp, the world's biggest printer firm, declined to comment on the lawsuit. Hp ink cartridges use a chip technology to sense when they are low on ink and advise the user to make a change.

As the temperature of a lipid molecule is increased, the electric birefringence can decrease, indicating that the molecule is becoming more flexible and less ordered.This decrease in electric birefringence can be observed in the infrared region of the spectrum, which is a range of wavelengths that is invisible to the naked eye. By analyzing the changes in the electric birefringence of a lipid molecule as it undergoes the mesogenic phase transition, researchers can gain insight into the molecular-level changes that are occurring during this process.In addition to the mesogenic phase transition, there are also two other types of orientational relaxation that can occur",

They observe two separate fermi sea levels at high energies, associated with spin and charge excitations, as well as the emergence of three additional 1D 'replica' modes that strengthen with decreasing wire length. The effective interaction strength in the wires is varied by changing the amount of 1D inter-subband screening by over 45%.\n\nThe paper starts by explaining the concept of many-body localization, which is the phenomenon of localization of electrons in a system of interacting particles. In the context of one-dimensional gated-wires, the many-body localization is a complex problem due to the Coulomb repulsion between the electrons. The authors then describe the tunneling spectroscopy technique they used to measure the many-body localization in the wires.\nThe authors then present their experimental results, which show the existence of two separate fermi sea levels at high energies, associated with spin and charge excitations, as well as the emergence of three additional 1D 'replica' modes that strengthen with decreasing wire length. They find that the effective interaction strength in the wires is varied by changing the amount of 1D inter-subband screening by over 45%.\nThe paper is well",

In the center of this cloud, our sun formed and ignited. Along with that, what we now know as planets, comets and asteroids formed. What then happened, according to theory, is that when the earth had cooled down a bit after its formation, comets massively impacted the earth and delivered water to earth.

This material cooled and condensed to form the planets, moons, dwarf planets, and other objects in the solar system.\nThe planets and other objects in the solar system formed in different ways. The rocky planets, like Earth and Mars, formed through a process called accretion, where small particles of dust and rock stuck together to form larger and larger bodies.

The experiment raises questions about the nature of reality and the human experience, and whether or not people would choose to plug their brains into such a machine if it were possible.\nThe passage suggests that the machine would provide indistinguishable experiences from reality, with no pain or negative experiences, but only pleasure. The idea is that life's natural ups and downs would be replaced with an endless series of ups, creating a life of constant pleasure.The passage does not provide any information about the potential drawbacks or limitations of such a machine, or the ethical implications of plugging one's brain into it. It simply presents the idea as a thought experiment, leaving readers to ponder the possibilities and consequences of such a technology.",

A few years ago, I was consulted to see a 70-year-old retired English professor who had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. As a consultant, I was asked to assess her symptoms, which included pain, nausea, and vomiting. During the consultation, she inquired about the potential benefits of medical marijuana. I was taken aback by her question, as I had learned very little about medical marijuana during my medical training. I had to rely on my clinical judgment and professional experience to provide a thoughtful and compassionate response. I explained to her that while I understood her interest in medical marijuana, it was not a widely accepted treatment for pancreatic cancer at the time, and I could not recommend it as a viable option. I also acknowledged the potential risks and uncertainties associated with its use. Despite my reservations, I empathized with her desire to explore all possible treatment options, and I offered to discuss the matter further with her oncologist.
