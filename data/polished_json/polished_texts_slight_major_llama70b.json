As a result, frogging didn't work well, and the yarn kept breaking. Surprisingly, I didn't even swear, which is out of character for me.

The moment you start according a symbol - any symbol - that kind of automatic reverence and protection, you've taken a small but important step towards totalitarianism.

        "polished": "Mark Guzman 6-28-02.nsf - I wanted to ensure you saw this information from Les Rawson regarding Grays Harbor and Willamette. -Bill \n\nBeginning immediately, Enron has acquired control area reserves service from BPA. This enables services to sell unit contingent energy as hourly firm, as BPA will supply reserves for up to 60 minutes. If Grays Harbor Paper notifies RT of a unit derate or outage, RT should immediately notify BPA Dispatch and adjust the schedule accordingly during the next ramp. For instance, if Grays' unit trips at 1333, RT would notify BPA and adjust the schedule to zero for 1400, effective at the top of the hour. The key takeaway is that 60 minutes is the maximum time BPA will maintain the schedule.",

The combat feels sloppy and doesn't feel as sharp as arkham city managed to make it. As of writing this recommendation (26/10/2013) there is a game breaking bug that stops a side mission from ever being completed (main story not effected).

The voice actors for optimus, megatron, bumblebee, and many others are back, and instantly recognisable. The distinctive cartoon transformation sound is there. Graphically, the cell-shaded presentation is perfect, and very, very generation one. But aside from that, it's actually a very fun game. The combat mechanics are extremely well done. Transforming mid-fight is often a necessity, and woven seamlessly into combos, making it quite unlike high moon's excellent war for/fall of cybertron games. Another distinction is the heavy focus on melee combat, but some enemies (e.g. Seekers) require a switch to a ranged blaster.",

The classic cartoon transformation sound effect is also present. The cell-shaded graphics are flawless and quintessentially Generation One.

The combat mechanics are exceptionally well-executed, with mid-fight transformations often being a necessity that seamlessly integrates into combos, setting it apart from High Moon's excellent War for/Fall of Cybertron games.

The game offers a considerable amount of choice, allowing you to decide what to build to gain an advantage, which weapons to wield, and what power-ups to equip them with, as well as selecting drinks that grant bonus effects. The art style and music are fantastic, with vibrant visuals that defy the notion that a post-apocalyptic world must be dull. One of the standout features is the dynamic narration, which responds to the player's actions, such as switching between weapons in the armoury, prompting the narrator to comment on the new choice.",

The settlements in this game often detract from the narrative, making it feel like a chore to manage them instead of progressing through the story.

The game is plagued by numerous bugs, including a frustrating incident where my Pip-Boy disappeared permanently, forcing me to resort to console commands to retrieve it. Power armor is readily available from the start, and power cores can be easily purchased from traders, significantly diminishing its value compared to previous Fallout games.

The firm is currently being dismantled by Russian authorities to settle a $27 billion (\u00a314 billion) tax bill. In an attempt to utilize international business law to block the forced sale of its key oil production unit, Yuganskneftegas, Yukos filed for bankruptcy in the US. However, the unit was sold to state-owned oil firm Rosneft for $9.4 billion, following a disrupted state auction. Yukos' lawyers now argue that the auction breached US bankruptcy law.

This 'few-get-richer' phenomenon arises in settings with limited distinct classes of items, such as left-leaning versus right-leaning news sources, where items are ranked by popularity. We analytically demonstrate that this effect emerges when users tend to click on top-ranked items and exhibit heterogeneous preferences for item classes. Through simulations, we examine how the effect's strength varies with different assumptions about the setting and human behavior. We also experimentally validate our predictions in an online study with human participants, yielding findings with significant implications for understanding the dissemination of misinformation.",

However, most of the pruning techniques are essentially trade-offs between model accuracy and regularity which lead to impaired inference accuracy and limited on-device acceleration performance. To solve the problem, we introduce a new sparsity dimension, namely pattern-based sparsity that comprises pattern and connectivity sparsity, and becoming both highly accurate and hardware friendly. With carefully designed patterns, the proposed pruning unprecedentedly and consistently achieves accuracy enhancement and better feature extraction ability on different dnn structures and datasets, and our pattern-aware pruning framework also achieves pattern library extraction, pattern selection, pattern and connectivity pruning and weight training simultaneously. Our approach on the new pattern-based sparsity naturally fits into compiler optimization for highly efficient dnn execution on mobile platforms.",

        "polished": "I'd like to share with you the future of money, and to do so, let's begin with a fascinating story about the Yap culture in Micronesia in the early 1900s. The Yap people are particularly noteworthy due to their unique form of currency, which I'd like to highlight. They utilized massive limestone discs known as rai stones. What's intriguing about the Yap's use of rai stones is that they didn't physically move or exchange them as we do with our coins, primarily because these stones can be enormous, with the largest weighing around four tons and measuring 12 feet in diameter. Instead, the Yap simply kept track of who owned which part of a stone. There's an interesting anecdote about a group of sailors who were transporting a stone across the ocean when they encountered trouble, resulting in the stone falling into the water.",
