The rate schedule effective August 2000 through September 2000 results in a significantly higher commodity charge because SDG&E customers will receive a lump sum reimbursement during those two months. SDG&E customers can anticipate lower electric bills. Assuming the lump sum reimbursement is excluded from the implicit energy component, the average from June 2000 through January 2001 is 6.2 cts, and the implicit commodity average from February 2001 through December 2001 is 7.3 cts. The overall average implicit commodity from June 2000 through December 2001 is 6.9 cts. For deliveries starting September 1, 2000, the average remains 6.9 cts.\"  \n\n(Edited exactly 25 words.)",

Scotland's justice minister has warned bigoted soccer fans that she aims to hit them 'where it hurts most' by banning them from matches. Cathy Jamieson said exclusion orders are among a series of measures being considered in the Scottish Executive\u2019s campaign against sectarianism. She praised Celtic and Rangers for their efforts in tackling the problem. However, the minister emphasized that stopping sectarian abuse linked to Old Firm matches is a key priority. Ms. Jamieson spoke ahead of the third-round Scottish Cup clash between the Glasgow clubs at Parkhead on Sunday. The sectarianism long tied to sections of both clubs' support has become a major focus for the Executive. Last week, Ms. Jamieson and First Minister Jack McConnell met supporters' representatives from both clubs to discuss the issue.",

We propose a weight-exponentiated formulation for the random effects distribution that ensures unbiased inference for hyperparameters. We compare our approach with frequentist methods relying on numerical integration, showing that only the Bayesian method achieves both design-unbiased estimation and consistency with the population distribution. Our simulations and real-data example from a business establishment survey demonstrate the method's utility across various models and sampling designs.
