The first chapter deals with \u201cimplacement\u201d and the second, \u201cdisplacement.\u201d in the first chapter, casey makes the distinction that our contemporary world and culture revolves around time as the situating force: we are running out of time, we have saved time, we are just in time. He is trying to make the case that using place as the center of culture gives a more grounded community. (that is a very rough summation, a disclaimer just in case my professor or any other classmate happens to read this post.) so far, this book is the first reading that has grabbed me by the proverbial shoulders.",

The positives include some of the best characters, a good story, a wealth of content, customizable characters, and the ability to form relationships with most companions, including romantic interests. On the negative side, the graphics are subpar, love scenes can be awkward, and there are instances of invisible walls. One mission may be considered dull, but taste is subjective.

The story wasn't just a narrative, but it felt like I was the character, trying to unravel the mystery of what was to come next. The gameplay was excellent, and I learned a lot about myself through this game, particularly about my fear of heights, which I never had a problem with until the ice caverns.

        "polished": "If you enjoyed Witcher 1 and 2, Witcher 3 is a must-have. I would normally give this game a 10/10 rating, but unfortunately, after the 1.03 update, the game became plagued by bugs and random crashes. It's essential to save frequently. In the initial version 1.00 to 1.03, I didn't experience any issues. I've also noticed that, post-patch, the drawing distance can be problematic, causing objects to appear when you're close up or even people. However, if you overlook these minor issues, the game is truly exceptional. The developers have made significant strides in crafting quests, some of which are emotionally resonant and profound, with numerous side quests and the fact that your choices have a substantial impact on the game. I've logged over 50 hours and am still immersed.",

However, helicity selection rules for the diboson scattering amplitudes set an obstruction to the naive interference contributions of dimension-six operators, causing the total diboson rate correction's leading contribution to cancel. In this case, measuring the azimuthal decay angles \"resurrects\" the interference, recouping sensitivity to the non-interfering operators. We explore these signatures in detail, finding that the EFT uncertainties associated with higher-dimensional operators are uniquely well-suppressed by the construction of an asymmetry variable, which is only generated by these non-interfering operators, relegating the effects of higher-dimensional, interfering operators to the same status as statistical errors in this observable.",

        "polished": "Novel concepts, perspectives, and challenges in measuring and controlling an open quantum system via sequential schemes are presented. We discuss how similar protocols, relying both on repeated quantum measurements and dynamical decoupling control pulses, enable us to confine and protect quantum dynamics from decoherence in accordance with the zeno physics. This allows us to analytically predict the probability that a quantum system is transferred into a target quantum state by means of stochastic sequential measurements. We also discuss the optimal reconstruction of environmental noise sources by orthogonalizing in the frequency domain the filter functions driving the designed quantum-sensor. The achievement of these tasks will enhance our capability to observe and manipulate open quantum systems, thus bringing advances to quantum science and technologies.",

(laughter)i remember watching, in 2003, an interview between fox news host tony snow and then-us defense secretary, donald rumsfeld. They were talking about the recent invasion of iraq, and rumsfeld is asked the question, \"well, we're hear about our body counts, but we never hear about theirs, why?\" and rumsfeld's answer is, \"well, we don't do body counts on other people.\"",

Be the media.\" As an artist, I appreciate working with media and technology because I'm familiar with their capabilities and the immense power they wield. However, I also fear the potential for abuse of this power. I recall a striking interview in 2003 between Tony Snow, a Fox News host, and Donald Rumsfeld, then-US Defense Secretary. They discussed the Iraq invasion, and Rumsfeld's response to a question about the number of civilian casualties was telling  \"We don't do body counts on other people.\"",
