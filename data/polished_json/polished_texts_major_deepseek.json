Rubin\u2019s expertise stands in stark contrast to the current administration\u2019s domestic policy leadership, which lacks comparable depth and credibility.  \n\nSecond, the argument that Republicans should govern exclusively during wartime is untenable, given their deliberate framing of an indefinite, borderless \"War on Terror.\" This rhetorical strategy effectively manufactures perpetual justification for their political dominance, undermining democratic accountability.",

Firstly, i think that the idea of having a law against flag-burning is completely nuts. The moment you start according a symbol - any symbol - that kind of automatic reverence and protection, you've taken a small but important step towards totalitarianism. Symbols are kind of fickle - they don't a priori represent anything in themselves; it's what they are perceived as meaning or made to represent that's important.",

When we grant any symbol\u2014regardless of its significance\u2014such unquestioning veneration and legal safeguarding, we inch dangerously closer to authoritarianism.

I quite hate pre-quals as it's technically going backwards in a story and not forwards (this is an issue for every pre-qual). Granted it offers more storywise. The combat feels sloppy and doesn't feel as sharp as arkham city managed to make it. As of writing this recommendation (26/10/2013) there is a game breaking bug that stops a side mission from ever being completed (main story not effected). Some gadgets are put at a rediculous hotkey that makes your hand have to travel the whole keyboard to get to it. It might sound like nothing, but while in combat it could potentially break your combo.",

Additionally, certain gadgets are mapped to awkward keybindings, forcing unnecessary hand movement across the keyboard\u2014a seemingly minor issue that can disrupt combat flow and break combos at crucial moments.",

However, most of the pruning techniques are essentially trade-offs between model accuracy and regularity which lead to impaired inference accuracy and limited on-device acceleration performance. To solve the problem, we introduce a new sparsity dimension, namely pattern-based sparsity that comprises pattern and connectivity sparsity, and becoming both highly accurate and hardware friendly. With carefully designed patterns, the proposed pruning unprecedentedly and consistently achieves accuracy enhancement and better feature extraction ability on different dnn structures and datasets, and our pattern-aware pruning framework also achieves pattern library extraction, pattern selection, pattern and connectivity pruning and weight training simultaneously. Our approach on the new pattern-based sparsity naturally fits into compiler optimization for highly efficient dnn execution on mobile platforms.",

Now, i want to tell you about the yap because their form of money is really interesting. They use these limestone discs called rai stones. Now, the yap don't actually move these rai stones around or exchange them the way we do with our coins, because rai stones can get to be pretty massive. The largest is about four tons and 12 feet across. So the yap just keep track of who owns part of what stone.there's a story about these sailors that were transporting a stone across the ocean when they ran into some trouble and the stone actually fell in.",

Our story begins with the Yapese people of the early 20th century, whose unique approach to wealth challenges our modern notions of money.  \n\nTheir currency consisted of massive limestone discs known as Rai stones, some reaching staggering proportions\u2014the largest recorded specimen measured twelve feet in diameter and weighed approximately four tons. Unlike contemporary coins or bills, these monumental stones rarely changed physical possession due to their impractical size. Instead, the Yapese maintained an intricate oral ledger system to track ownership rights.  \n\nA particularly memorable account illustrates this system's resilience: when a transport vessel lost a Rai stone to the ocean depths during a storm, the community simply acknowledged the stone's continued existence and value, adjusting ownership records accordingly rather than retrieving the sunken currency. This remarkable practice reveals profound insights about the nature of money as a collective agreement rather than a physical commodity.",

And so, i would like to cheer you up with one of the great, albeit largely unknown, commercial success stories of the past 20 years. Comparable, in its own very peculiar way, to the achievements of microsoft or google. And it's an industry which has bucked the current recession with equanimity. I refer to organized crime.now organized crime has been around for a very long time, i hear you say, and these would be wise words, indeed. But in the last two decades, it has experienced an unprecedented expansion, now accounting for roughly 15 percent of the world's gdp. I like to call it the global shadow economy, or mcmafia, for short.so what triggered this extraordinary growth in cross-border crime?",
        "polished": "Fellow TEDsters, we find ourselves navigating profoundly challenging economic waters\u2014times that test resilience and demand innovative perspectives. Yet amidst this turbulence, I wish to share an extraordinary, if often overlooked, narrative of commercial triumph over the past two decades. This phenomenon stands as a singular parallel\u2014in its own unconventional manner\u2014to the meteoric rises of Microsoft or Google. Remarkably, this sector has weathered our current economic downturn with striking composure.  \n\nI speak, of course, of organized crime.  \n\nNow, you might rightly observe that syndicated criminal enterprises are hardly a recent development\u2014and you\u2019d be absolutely correct. But the past twenty years have witnessed an unparalleled surge in their scale and influence, with illicit networks now contributing an estimated 15% of global GDP. I\u2019ve come to term this sprawling underworld the \"Global Shadow Economy\"\u2014or, more succinctly, *McMafia*.  \n\nSo what catalyzed this staggering expansion of transnational crime?",
