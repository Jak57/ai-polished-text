Just keep in mind there is lots of (skippable) talking. As usual, I would suggest using a gamepad, but I had no problems with key/mouse setup, both completely rebindable. Price is about right and wouldn't have been unhappy about a purchase. More than half the DLC is included free, which is still plenty to play with.

Imo, this is a really great and fun game in truth, although the format may be somewhat annoying (where the free-roam city area repopulates with new enemies every time you progress the story). I particularly enjoyed the 'dual play' segments (where you can play batman + 1 more), and the ability to use the controller for most segments of the game but the mouse and keyboard for the tank combat segments was greatly appreciated. Driving your batmobile around the free-roam city, including when chasing the apc commanders, is actually quite enjoyable once you figure out how to use the breaks to skid around corners (and when you master that, driving around the city is really quite enjoyable!)",

The character design is on point, with there being various characters with various personailities and secrets to them. It sticks out from other rpg's because you don't have to kill anyone, which is an unused concept in rpg's.

We show that all local minima share the same form of structure that partially identifies the component centers of the true mixture, in the sense that each local minimum involves a non-overlapping combination of fitting multiple gaussians to a single true component and fitting a single gaussian to multiple true components. Our results apply to the setting where the true mixture components satisfy a certain separation condition, and are valid even when the number of components is over-or under-specified.

Due to nonconvexity, multiple local minima exist that are not globally optimal, even when the mixture is well-separated. We demonstrate that all local minima have a structural form that partially identifies the component centers of the true mixture. Specifically, each local minimum involves fitting multiple Gaussians to a single true component and fitting a single Gaussian to multiple true components without overlap. Our findings apply when the true mixture components satisfy a specific separation condition and remain valid whether the number of components is over- or under-specified.

Despite ode's wide usage in modeling, frequent absence of their analytic solutions makes it difficult to estimate ode parameters from the data, especially when the model has lots of variables and parameters. This paper proposes a bayesian ode parameter estimating algorithm which is fast and accurate even for models with many parameters. The proposed method approximates an ode model with a state-space model based on equations of a numeric solver. It allows fast estimation by avoiding computations of a whole numerical solution in the likelihood. The posterior is obtained by a variational bayes method, more specifically, the approximate riemannian conjugate gradient method (honkela et al.",

Here we report on our examination of the long-term behavior of the surface conductivity of titanium-implanted alumina.

There can be a disconnect between broad, attention-grabbing headlines and the often specific, incremental results of the medical research they cover. So how can you avoid being misled by sensational headlines? The best way to assess a headline\u2019s credibility is to look at the original research it reports on. We\u2019ve devised a hypothetical research scenario for each of these three headlines. Keep watching for the explanation of the first example; then pause at the headline to answer the question. These are simplified scenarios.",
