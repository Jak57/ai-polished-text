The first chapter deals with \u201cimplacement\u201d and the second, \u201cdisplacement.\u201d in the first chapter, casey makes the distinction that our contemporary world and culture revolves around time as the situating force: we are running out of time, we have saved time, we are just in time. He is trying to make the case that using place as the center of culture gives a more grounded community. (that is a very rough summation, a disclaimer just in case my professor or any other classmate happens to read this post.) so far, this book is the first reading that has grabbed me by the proverbial shoulders.",

(thanks mike for the ticket) daniel radcliffe aka harry potter had grown up soo fast and he is sooo cute!! malofy too haha. Okay well... The movie was all the great i give it 4 1/2 stars because they left out important details!! overall, the movie was good... I didn't really dress up to get the movie but i was wearing a ravenclaw tie even though, i like gryffindors better. I might go see the movie again like in 2 more weeks.",
        "polished": "I completely agree with your review! I also gave the movie 3 out of 5 stars. I thought it was a fun and entertaining movie, but there were some noticeable flaws. I was disappointed that they left out some important details from the book, such as the reason why Voldemort was so obsessed with gaining immortality, and the backstory of some of the characters. It also felt like some of the humor and wit from the book was lost in the movie adaptation. Overall, I think the movie was good, but it could have been better with a few more faithful adaptations.",

The moment you start according a symbol - any symbol - that kind of automatic reverence and protection, you've taken a small but important step towards totalitarianism.

In this context, the term \"cross-default\" refers to a situation where one party fails to meet their obligations under the loan agreement, and this can lead to a cross-default event.\n\nBased on the language used in the document, it appears that the parties are trying to establish a clear understanding of what constitutes a cross-default event, and how it will be handled in the event that one party fails to meet their obligations. The document also suggests that the parties are trying to avoid a situation where a cross-default event could lead to a domino effect, where one default by one party could trigger a default by another party.\n\nIn the second sentence, the term \"materially weaker\" is used to describe a situation where a party's financial condition is weakened to the point where they are no longer able to meet their obligations under the loan agreement. The term \"below BBB-\" is likely a reference to a specific credit rating threshold,",

The combat feels sloppy and doesn't feel as sharp as arkham city managed to make it. As of writing this recommendation (26/10/2013) there is a game breaking bug that stops a side mission from ever being completed (main story not effected).

Imo, this is a really great and fun game in truth, although the format may be somewhat annoying (where the free-roam city area repopulates with new enemies every time you progress the story). I particularly enjoyed the 'dual play' segments (where you can play batman + 1 more), and the ability to use the controller for most segments of the game but the mouse and keyboard for the tank combat segments was greatly appreciated. Driving your batmobile around the free-roam city, including when chasing the apc commanders, is actually quite enjoyable once you figure out how to use the breaks to skid around corners (and when you master that, driving around the city is really quite enjoyable!)",

It is an odd mix between a classic 2d platformer and an moba, and does it with style. I found myself enjoying characters that i wouldn't enjoy in other moba games. I had expected this trait to continue, but decided to give a melee tank a go anyway. I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome and ended up trying out more as they were unlocked from playing games. The art style and interface is oddly charming. As such, i now use one of the characters as my avatar and a wallpaper from creating a card set for the game.",

The ability to control a dragon and use its abilities in combat is a fresh and exciting twist on the traditional RTS genre. The risk-like nature of the game's grand strategy mode adds an extra layer of challenge and replayability, as players must carefully manage their resources and make strategic decisions to achieve victory.\nThe game's focus on exploration and colonization also adds a new layer of depth to the traditional RTS formula, as players must balance the need to expand their territory with the need to protect their colonies from threats.Overall, I think Divinity: Dragon Commander is a great example of how the RTS genre can be innovated and expanded upon with new ideas and mechanics.",

A little dissapointed, but still optimistic, i carried on to see what i could do. I will give the game credit, the character customization, although limited, is pretty fun to mess around with.

A quarter of broadband users in britain regularly upload content and have personal sites, according to a report by uk think-tank demos. It said that having an always-on, fast connection is changing the way people use the internet. More than five million households in the uk have broadband and that number is growing fast. The demos report looked at the impact of broadband on people's net habits. It found that more than half of those with broadband logged on to the web before breakfast. One in five even admitted to getting up in the middle of the night to browse the web. More significantly, argues the report, broadband is encouraging people to take a more active role online.",

We demonstrate analytically that the few-get-richer effect emerges when people tend to click on top-ranked items and have heterogeneous preferences for the classes of items.

With carefully designed patterns, the proposed pruning unprecedentedly and consistently achieves accuracy enhancement and better feature extraction ability on different dnn structures and datasets, and our pattern-aware pruning framework also achieves pattern library extraction, pattern selection, pattern and connectivity pruning and weight training simultaneously.

Instead, the Yap keep track of who owns part of what stone, much like a ledger system.\nAccording to a story, a group of sailors were transporting a rai stone across the ocean when they encountered some trouble and the stone actually fell into the ocean.

In the center of this cloud, our sun formed and ignited. Along with that, what we now know as planets, comets and asteroids formed. What then happened, according to theory, is that when the earth had cooled down a bit after its formation, comets massively impacted the earth and delivered water to earth.

This cloud collapsed under its own gravity, and the material began to heat up and become denser as it colms. At the center of this cloud, the Sun formed from the gravitational collapse of a dense region of gas and dust called the solar protoplanet. The Sun was formed when the material in the solar protoplanet was heated by nuclear reactions, causing it to shine.\nAs the Sun formed, it began to attract nearby matter, including small, rocky bodies called planetesimals, which collided and merged to form larger bodies called protoplanets. These protoplanets continued to collide and merge, eventually forming the rocky planets, gas giants, and other bodies we see in the solar system today.\nThe Earth is thought to have formed through a process called accretion, in which small",

When plants and other living things die, much of their stored carbon makes its way back to the atmosphere until new plants grow and reabsorb the carbon.but over millions of years, some of the carbon stored in ancient trees and sea life becomes rock and some becomes fossil fuels: coal, oil and natural gas. Natural events like volcanic eruptions release some of the carbon trapped in rock. And human activities, like burning fossil fuels, also release some of that prehistoric carbon.today, humans release around 60 times more carbon than all the volcanoes on the planet each year.",

Robust systems are stable in complex and new environments. Remarkably, cockroaches can self-stabilize running over rough terrain. When we put a jet pack on them, or give them a perturbation like an earthquake, we discovered that their wonderfully tuned legs allow them to self-stabilize without using any of their brainpower. They can go over complex terrain like grass, no problem, and not get destabilized. We discovered a new behavior where, because of their shape, they actually roll automatically to their side to go through this artificial test bit of grass.robust systems can perform multiple tasks with the same structure. Here's a new behavior we've discovered.",
