I didn't even swear, which is unusual for me. I just morosely ripped and listened to season two of sex and the city (way to go, library!). And then i got sick of it and threw it away.

I lost approximately $10 worth of yarn, with each skein costing $8. Unfortunately, by the time I reached the armholes, there were too many stitches, and the mohair kept tangling as I knitted. Trying to undo the rows, known as frogging, was ineffective because the yarn frequently snapped. Despite my usual tendency to swear in such situations, I remained surprisingly calm. Instead, I just listened to the second season of \"Sex and the City\" (thanks to my library) while I unraveled my work in a rather gloomy manner.

Firstly, i think that the idea of having a law against flag-burning is completely nuts. The moment you start according a symbol - any symbol - that kind of automatic reverence and protection, you've taken a small but important step towards totalitarianism. Symbols are kind of fickle - they don't a priori represent anything in themselves; it's what they are perceived as meaning or made to represent that's important.",

To begin with, I find the idea of enacting a law against flag-burning entirely irrational. When we start granting any symbol\u2014regardless of its nature\u2014an unquestioning reverence and legal protection, we take a significant step towards totalitarianism.

You can try it for 15 days and then go back to something else, or pony up $25 if you like it. A feature that jumps out at me right away is how each post is its own entity, and can be moved around, stored, labeled, and even deleted.

        "polished": "Subject: Important Update: Control Area Reserves Service from BPA\n\nHello Mark,\n\nI wanted to bring to your attention a message from Les Rawson regarding Grays Harbor and Willamette.\n\nEffective immediately, Enron has secured control area reserves services from BPA. This allows the sale of unit-contingent energy on an hourly firm basis because BPA is providing reserves for up to 60 minutes. If Grays Harbor Paper experiences a unit derate or outage, RT should promptly inform BPA dispatch and adjust the schedule during the next ramp. For instance, if the Grays unit trips at 13:33, RT would notify BPA and ensure that by the top of the next hour (14:00), the schedule for he 14:00 is reduced to zero. Please note that BPA will maintain the schedule for a maximum of 60 minutes.\n\nBest regards,\nBill",

The order outlines the possibility of $69 million in refunds, requiring either payment or cost justification. Although Enron is not listed among the 13 entities accused of overcharging, PGE is, with an allegation of $3.18 million. This is not the end of the matter. The order currently addresses only January 2001 and indicates that further directives will cover December 2000 and establish benchmark prices through April 2001. The pricing used to determine potential refunds was quite high, at $273/MWh, incorporating gas prices, emissions costs, and an assumed heat rate exceeding 16,000. Regarding sales to California, we have finalized at least one short-term transaction and held discussions with the California Department of Water Resources about longer-term agreements.

The combat feels sloppy and doesn't feel as sharp as arkham city managed to make it. As of writing this recommendation (26/10/2013) there is a game breaking bug that stops a side mission from ever being completed (main story not effected). Some gadgets are put at a rediculous hotkey that makes your hand have to travel the whole keyboard to get to it.

I'm generally not a fan of prequels because they move backward in a narrative rather than advancing it (a common issue with all prequels). Nevertheless, they often add depth to the storyline. Unfortunately, the combat in this game feels less refined than the sharp mechanics achieved in Arkham City. At the time of writing this review (October 26, 2013), there's a game-breaking bug that prevents the completion of a side mission, although the main storyline remains unaffected.

It stands out as one of the finest RPGs or games I have experienced. If you're a fan of RPGs, you likely already own it.",

The voice actors for optimus, megatron, bumblebee, and many others are back, and instantly recognisable. The distinctive cartoon transformation sound is there. Graphically, the cell-shaded presentation is perfect, and very, very generation one. But aside from that, it's actually a very fun game. The combat mechanics are extremely well done. Transforming mid-fight is often a necessity, and woven seamlessly into combos, making it quite unlike high moon's excellent war for/fall of cybertron games. Another distinction is the heavy focus on melee combat, but some enemies (e.g. Seekers) require a switch to a ranged blaster.",

Visually, the cel-shaded graphics are spot on, perfectly capturing the essence of Generation One. Beyond nostalgia, this is an incredibly enjoyable game with expertly crafted combat mechanics. Transforming during battles is frequently necessary and seamlessly integrated into combos, offering a unique experience compared to High Moon's outstanding War for Cybertron and Fall of Cybertron games. Additionally, there is a significant emphasis on melee combat, although certain foes, such as the Seekers, necessitate switching to ranged blasters for effective engagement.",

Although the controls can be a bit cumbersome and the gameplay isn't its strongest suit, the story is so captivating that these issues seemed insignificant to me. The game also excels in humor, which is seamlessly woven into the narrative without detracting from its profound nature. And, for fans, there are endless references to Doctor Who to be enjoyed.",

A study by the UK think-tank Demos reveals that one in four broadband users in Britain regularly uploads content and maintains personal websites. The report highlights that the availability of constant, fast internet connections is transforming how people engage with the web. Currently, over five million households in the UK are equipped with broadband, and this figure continues to rise rapidly. The Demos report investigates the influence of broadband on users' online behaviors, discovering that more than half of broadband users access the internet before having breakfast. Moreover, one in five users confessed to waking up in the middle of the night specifically to browse the web. The report further emphasizes that broadband is motivating individuals to take a more engaged and participative approach to the online world.",

But the suit claims the chips also shut down the cartridges at a predetermined date regardless of whether they are empty.",
        "polished": "A woman from the United States has filed a lawsuit against Hewlett-Packard (HP), alleging that its printer ink cartridges are designed to expire on a specific date. This woman, hailing from Georgia and choosing not to reveal her identity, claims that a chip inside these cartridges signals the printer to require a refill even when it's not necessary. The lawsuit aims to include all individuals in the United States who have bought an HP inkjet printer since February 2001. HP, known as the largest printer manufacturer globally, has not provided any comments on this legal action. It is known that HP ink cartridges use chip technology to detect low ink levels and alert users to replace them. However, the lawsuit contends that these chips also deactivate the cartridges after a set period, regardless of whether or not they are actually empty.",

While some gains have been obtained by learning individual parts of a receiver, a better approach is to jointly learn the whole receiver. This, however, often results in a challenging nonlinear problem, for which the optimal solution is infeasible to implement. To this end, we propose a deep fully convolutional neural network, deeprx, which executes the whole receiver pipeline from frequency domain signal stream to uncoded bits in a 5g-compliant fashion.

Our micromagnetic simulations highlight the nonlinear responses of MSM and STNOs when stimulated by current pulses, demonstrating that an RC system based on a single MSM excels in image classification tasks, such as recognizing handwritten digits. Furthermore, a physical RC system composed of 24 STNOs effectively addresses complex and previously unknown nonlinear dynamic problems, as evidenced in tasks involving a second-order nonlinear dynamic system and NARMA10.",

In this paper, we identify a surprising consequence of popularity-based rankings: the fewer the items reporting a given signal, the higher the share of the overall traffic they collectively attract. This few-get-richer effect emerges in settings where there are few distinct classes of items (e.g., left-leaning news sources versus right-leaning news sources), and items are ranked based on their popularity. We demonstrate analytically that the few-get-richer effect emerges when people tend to click on top-ranked items and have heterogeneous preferences for the classes of items. Using simulations, we analyze how the strength of the effect changes with assumptions about the setting and human behavior. We also test our predictions experimentally in an online experiment with human participants. Our findings have important implications to understand the spread of misinformation.",

In this study, we explore an unexpected outcome of popularity-based rankings: the fewer the number of items that signify a particular indicator, the greater the proportion of total traffic they tend to garner. This phenomenon, known as the few-get-richer effect, becomes evident in scenarios where there are limited distinct categories of items (for instance, news outlets with left-leaning and right-leaning biases) and items are ranked by their popularity. Through analytical methods, we demonstrate that this effect is pronounced when users predominantly click on items that top the rankings and exhibit diverse preferences for the categories. We further examine the effect's intensity under varying assumptions about the environment and human behavior through simulations. Additionally, we validate our hypotheses via an online experiment involving human participants. Our results offer significant insights into the dissemination of misinformation.",

However, most of the pruning techniques are essentially trade-offs between model accuracy and regularity which lead to impaired inference accuracy and limited on-device acceleration performance. To solve the problem, we introduce a new sparsity dimension, namely pattern-based sparsity that comprises pattern and connectivity sparsity, and becoming both highly accurate and hardware friendly. With carefully designed patterns, the proposed pruning unprecedentedly and consistently achieves accuracy enhancement and better feature extraction ability on different dnn structures and datasets, and our pattern-aware pruning framework also achieves pattern library extraction, pattern selection, pattern and connectivity pruning and weight training simultaneously. Our approach on the new pattern-based sparsity naturally fits into compiler optimization for highly efficient dnn execution on mobile platforms.",

The Yap people had a unique form of currency: enormous limestone discs called rai stones. These discs weren't exchanged or physically moved like our coins because they could be incredibly large, with the biggest weighing around four tons and measuring up to 12 feet in diameter. Instead, the Yap maintained a collective memory of who owned shares in each stone. There's a tale of sailors transporting a rai stone across the sea when it unfortunately sank to the ocean floor.

So you wouldn't have to get a big needle stuck in your arm in order to get your blood test done. So this was interesting not only because it was less painful, but also, it could potentially open the door to predictive diagnostics.",

At the time, there wasn't much information available about the company, but the little that was known was quite impressive. Theranos was developing a medical device that allowed for a full blood panel using just a finger-stick of blood. This innovation was intriguing not only because it eliminated the need for large needles, making the process less painful, but also because it had the potential to revolutionize predictive diagnostics.",
